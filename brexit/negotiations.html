Consequently, the UK initially had&nbsp;until <strong>29<sup>th</sup> of March, 2019</strong> to reach an exit deal with the EU, but this deadline was extended several times (see below).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since PM Theresa May triggered Article 50 on March 2017, there have been a number of negotiations and meetings organised between representatives of the EU and the UK, as well as between Theresa May and her own Parliament in Britain.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-guid="05edd130-5c09-4ca5-959a-c2f801a01c4d" id="heading-2">Theresa May's proposed deal</h2><p>At first, the British Government published a white paper, the Chequers plan, in July 2018, outlining its view on Brexit and the future relationship the UK wants to have with the EU.</p><p>A final draft version of the agreement was reached in November 2018, a version that has the EU&rsquo;s approval, but which still needs to be approved by the British Parliament.&nbsp; However, the EU has refused to renegotiate the deal if the British Parliament rejects it.</p><h3 id="heading-si3kz">The&nbsp;contents of May's deal</h3><p>The&nbsp;proposed deal includes provisions on the transition period, the Irish border, the cost of leaving the EU and a number of other areas such as security, trade, food etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal also establishes that the UK will leave the EU in 2019, but that it will continue to stay in the Single Market and accept its rules until 2020. During this time, the two sides should draft <strong>a new trade agreement</strong>. The transition period could be prolonged for another two years.</p><p>The deal also states that the UK and the EU should keep the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland free of customs until the end of 2020. This means that the UK will still have a customs deal with the EU. By that time, the two sides should reach an agreement that continues this<strong> backstop</strong> solution. This means that goods will be checked, but there will be no physical border between the two countries.</p><p>The deal further states that the UK will continue to pay some money to the EU in the form of contributions to EU programs that the country has already signed for until 2020. These contributions are often called the <strong>&ldquo;divorce bill&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong> by the media, and will amount to about 40 million euros that will be paid by the UK to the EU.</p><p>Another aspect included in the deal is related to citizens' rights and immigration. According to the negotiations, all EU citizens living in Britain as well as British people living in EU will still have the same rights to free movement. However, <strong>after the transition period ends, the UK can set up its own rules regarding immigration</strong>.</p><p>After leaving, the UK and the EU will try to find a way to continue to have a free trade area with common customs agreements. However, the exact future arrangement is to be negotiated.</p><p>In terms of security, the UK will lose all access to EU databases when the transition period ends. However, the deal allows for <strong>information exchanges</strong> in relevant situations which will also be the subject of another agreement. During the transition period, the UK will still have to comply with the rules of the EU in terms of justice and security.</p><p>The draft agreement only gives the financial centre in London <strong>a limited access to EU financial markets</strong>, something which will affect Britain&rsquo;s financial ambitions.</p><p>In terms of food and goods, the two sides need to reach a new agreement by the end of the transition period. Otherwise the customs backstop will continue and there will no tariffs in trading with the EU. But this will also mean that the UK will be unable to negotiate lower tariffs with countries outside the EU.</p><h2 data-guid="b926bcc9-39f2-4092-b114-efe820a9e571" id="heading-3">The British Parliament rejects the deal</h2><p>Even though a final draft for the deal was proposed, the Prime Minister Theresa May is still facing a lot of opposition from the British Parliament, whose members have severely criticised the agreement.&nbsp;A vote was scheduled for early December 2018, but <strong>May chose to postpone the vote</strong> to January 2019, because she realised that the deal would not be accepted. She then tried to make the EU accept modifications to the deal while reaching out to Parliament to secure more support, but her efforts were mostly&nbsp;met with failure.</p><p>On January 15, 2019, the vote on Theresa May's proposal finally took place. It was <strong>an overwhelming defeat</strong> for her - one of the largest in British political history. The opposition immediately called for a vote of no confidence against May's government. The government survived the vote, and May started working on a revised plan, with further negotiations with both EU officials and Parliament.</p><h2 data-guid="16709c20-bb6a-469f-9766-d4dae9ec7c7e" id="heading-4">New parliamentary votes in March</h2><p>As promised,&nbsp;Theresa May presented a&nbsp;revised Brexit deal for a vote on the evening of&nbsp;<strong>March 12</strong>, 2019. However, the relatively minor changes failed to satisfy the sceptics, and the new deal was&nbsp;<em>also</em> <strong>defeated</strong> by a significant majority in Parliament, once again with many members of May's own party opposing the deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Because the deal failed, there was&nbsp;<em>another</em> vote on&nbsp;<strong>March 13</strong> to determine whether Parliament was willing to accept a 'no deal' scenario. Parliament voted against this possibility, as a majority proved unwilling to accept the no deal scenario. However, the vote is <strong>not legally binding</strong>, so no deal might still happen if the UK does not secure either a deal or an extension before the deadline.</p><p>There was finally a&nbsp;<em>third </em>vote on <strong>March 14</strong>, to determine whether the UK should seek an extension of Article 50, in effect delaying Brexit until a solution can be found. A large majority of Parliament voted for this option, hoping to give the UK a little more time to negotiate a deal before they are forced to leave the European Union without one.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the EU was less responsive to the UK&rsquo;s wishes than they initially hoped. As such, the UK at first only secured <strong>a relatively short initial extension</strong> &ndash; lasting until April 12.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="02d3b3cc-a326-4877-a8dc-8fd869cdc080">Deadline extended further</h2><p>After multiple failed attempts to get any kind of Brexit deal through Parliament, Theresa May was finally forced to ask the EU for a further extension of the deadline. May initially wanted a relatively short deadline, but she was forced to accept a long one, as the EU leaders were not convinced that she could secure support for her Brexit deal with a short extension, given her earlier failures.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Brexit deadline is the <strong>31st of October, 2019.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id="heading-tlv22" data-guid="395d2ff4-a78b-44ef-bd77-904f4ce253ee">May announces her resignation</h2><p>After yet another failed attempt at getting a version of her deal through Parliament, Theresa May announced that she would resign from her post on June 7th, 2019, and leave the task of securing a Brexit deal to the next&nbsp;Prime Minister, to be chosen from within the Conservative Party.<del>&nbsp;</del></p><h2 id="heading-z3czh" data-guid="5634be35-650b-4d11-be46-d03fa96b1fa8">Boris Johnson becomes the new Prime Minister</h2><p>After much internal struggle within the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson was finally chosen to become Theresa May&rsquo;s successor, and he assumed the office on July 24, 2019.</p><p>Johnson is known as a strong supporter of hard Brexit, and he has also said that he is ready to depart from the EU without a deal on October 31 if further negotiations do not lead anywhere. The very fact that Johnson became Prime Minister has thus led many political analysts to state that a no-deal scenario has become more likely than before, even though the British Parliament in general wants to avoid such a scenario. Since Johnson took office, no-deal preparations have thus been accelerated both in the UK and in the EU. &nbsp;</p><p>Johnson&rsquo;s first attempts at negotiating with the EU have not proven particularly successful, as Johnson insists on demands that the EU finds unrealistic &ndash; for example, he has stated that he wants them to abandon the idea of the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, the EU continues to remain firm in its stance that the central parts of the original agreement are non-negotiable, so at the moment it is hard to see a path towards progress.</p><h2 id="heading-o29ie" data-guid="69dd04cd-6c1d-45ab-9279-b6eb0e97668f">Johnson requests prorogation of Parliament</h2><p>On August 28, 2019, Boris Johnson&rsquo;s government gained the Queen&rsquo;s permission to prorogue the British Parliament for five weeks, starting in mid-September and ending on October 14. &nbsp;Prorogation means that Parliament is effectively suspended for the duration. It is a normal thing to do between parliamentary sessions, but both the duration and the timing of this particular prorogation are quite unusual, since it falls so close to the Brexit deadline on October 31.</p><p>Critics see Johnson&rsquo;s move as an undemocratic attempt to force Brexit through, perhaps ending in a no deal scenario. Because of the timing and duration of the prorogation, Parliament would have very limited time in which to analyse, criticise or challenge any proposed deal that Johnson and his government managed to present to them, leaving them with much less power to influence the process.</p><p>Johnson and his allies denied that the prorogation was&nbsp;politically motivated, and merely maintained that prorogation is a normal thing to do between sessions of parliament &ndash; and that the current session had been unusually long. However, this still failed&nbsp;to explain why the prorogation had&nbsp;to last a full five weeks, so their explanations did&nbsp;little to silence the criticism. &nbsp;</p><p>The prorogation went into effect on September 10, 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-ctz1q" data-guid="7779ecf9-7c38-4bd8-b321-7fe5e9b5c645">The Supreme Court rules prorogation unlawful</h2><p>On September 24, 2019, the justices of the UK Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, as Johnson and his government did not present convincing arguments that a five week prorogation was necessary, which suggested that it was rather a politically motivated move intended to silence Parliament during&nbsp;a crucial decision-making period. Therefore, Johnson's decision to prorogue Parliament was immediately rendered invalid, and Parliament was quick reassembled.</p><h2 id="heading-glvmm" data-guid="9c43d957-c2f6-4bb1-a02e-58babf844b7c">Deadline extended again</h2><p>The weeks leading up to the October 31 deadline were quite chaotic, as Boris Johnson was in a race against time to get a revised Brexit deal approved. Though he did manage to convince the EU to accept a few small changes from Theresa May&rsquo;s failed deal, he then had to convince Parliament to vote for it within a very short time.</p><p>However, though Parliament did not directly vote against Johnson&rsquo;s deal, they did vote against his accelerated time schedule for passing the deal, which led Johnson to abandon his hopes of meeting the deadline and instead seek a general election.</p><p>Because Parliament had previously passed the so-called <strong>Benn Act</strong>, Johnson was forced to ask the EU for a further deadline extension rather than letting the UK face a no-deal Brexit. This marked a major political defeat for Johnson, who had previously been very insistent that the UK would leave the EU on the October deadline, regardless of whether a deal had been struck.</p><p>After further complications and negotiations, the EU agreed to a new Brexit deadline on <strong>January 31, 2020</strong>.

During this time, the two sides should draft \u003cstrong\u003ea new trade agreement\u003c/strong\u003e. The transition period could be prolonged for another two years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe deal also states that the UK and the EU should keep the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland free of customs until the end of 2020. This means that the UK will still have a customs deal with the EU. By that time, the two sides should reach an agreement that continues this\u003cstrong\u003e backstop\u003c/strong\u003e solution. This means that goods will be checked, but there will be no physical border between the two countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe deal further states that the UK will continue to pay some money to the EU in the form of contributions to EU programs that the country has already signed for until 2020. These contributions are often called the \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;divorce bill\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e by the media, and will amount to about 40 million euros that will be paid by the UK to the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother aspect included in the deal is related to citizens\u0027 rights and immigration. According to the negotiations, all EU citizens living in Britain as well as British people living in EU will still have the same rights to free movement.

However, the deal allows for \u003cstrong\u003einformation exchanges\u003c/strong\u003e in relevant situations which will also be the subject of another agreement.

She then tried to make the EU accept modifications to the deal while reaching out to Parliament to secure more support, but her efforts were mostly\u0026nbsp;met with failure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn January 15, 2019, the vote on Theresa May\u0027s proposal finally took place. It was \u003cstrong\u003ean overwhelming defeat\u003c/strong\u003e for her - one of the largest in British political history. The opposition immediately called for a vote of no confidence against May\u0027s government.

However, the vote is \u003cstrong\u003enot legally binding\u003c/strong\u003e, so no deal might still happen if the UK does not secure either a deal or an extension before the deadline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was finally a\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ethird \u003c/em\u003evote on \u003cstrong\u003eMarch 14\u003c/strong\u003e, to determine whether the UK should seek an extension of Article 50, in effect delaying Brexit until a solution can be found.

May initially wanted a relatively short deadline, but she was forced to accept a long one, as the EU leaders were not convinced that she could secure support for her Brexit deal with a short extension, given her earlier failures.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new Brexit deadline is the \u003cstrong\u003e31st of October, 2019.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-tlv22\u0022 data-guid=\u0022395d2ff4-a78b-44ef-bd77-904f4ce253ee\u0022\u003eMay announces her resignation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter yet another failed attempt at getting a version of her deal through Parliament, Theresa May announced that she would resign from her post on June 7th, 2019, and leave the task of securing a Brexit deal to the next\u0026nbsp;Prime Minister, to be chosen from within the Conservative Party.\u003cdel\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-z3czh\u0022 data-guid=\u00225634be35-650b-4d11-be46-d03fa96b1fa8\u0022\u003eBoris Johnson becomes the new Prime Minister\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter much internal struggle within the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson was finally chosen to become Theresa May\u0026rsquo;s successor, and he assumed the office on July 24, 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohnson is known as a strong supporter of hard Brexit, and he has also said that he is ready to depart from the EU without a deal on October 31 if further negotiations do not lead anywhere. The very fact that Johnson became Prime Minister has thus led many political analysts to state that a no-deal scenario has become more likely than before, even though the British Parliament in general wants to avoid such a scenario. Since Johnson took office, no-deal preparations have thus been accelerated both in the UK and in the EU. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohnson\u0026rsquo;s first attempts at negotiating with the EU have not proven particularly successful, as Johnson insists on demands that the EU finds unrealistic \u0026ndash; for example, he has stated that he wants them to abandon the idea of the Irish backstop. Meanwhile, the EU continues to remain firm in its stance that the central parts of the original agreement are non-negotiable, so at the moment it is hard to see a path towards progress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-o29ie\u0022 data-guid=\u002269dd04cd-6c1d-45ab-9279-b6eb0e97668f\u0022\u003eJohnson requests prorogation of Parliament\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn August 28, 2019, Boris Johnson\u0026rsquo;s government gained the Queen\u0026rsquo;s permission to prorogue the British Parliament for five weeks, starting in mid-September and ending on October 14. \u0026nbsp;Prorogation means that Parliament is effectively suspended for the duration. It is a normal thing to do between parliamentary sessions, but both the duration and the timing of this particular prorogation are quite unusual, since it falls so close to the Brexit deadline on October 31.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCritics see Johnson\u0026rsquo;s move as an undemocratic attempt to force Brexit through, perhaps ending in a no deal scenario. Because of the timing and duration of the prorogation, Parliament would have very limited time in which to analyse, criticise or challenge any proposed deal that Johnson and his government managed to present to them, leaving them with much less power to influence the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohnson and his allies denied that the prorogation was\u0026nbsp;politically motivated, and merely maintained that prorogation is a normal thing to do between sessions of parliament \u0026ndash; and that the current session had been unusually long. However, this still failed\u0026nbsp;to explain why the prorogation had\u0026nbsp;to last a full five weeks, so their explanations did\u0026nbsp;little to silence the criticism. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe prorogation went into effect on September 10, 2019.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ctz1q\u0022 data-guid=\u00227779ecf9-7c38-4bd8-b321-7fe5e9b5c645\u0022\u003eThe Supreme Court rules prorogation unlawful\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn September 24, 2019, the justices of the UK Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson\u0027s prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, as Johnson and his government did not present convincing arguments that a five week prorogation was necessary, which suggested that it was rather a politically motivated move intended to silence Parliament during\u0026nbsp;a crucial decision-making period. Therefore, Johnson\u0027s decision to prorogue Parliament was immediately rendered invalid, and Parliament was quick reassembled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-glvmm\u0022 data-guid=\u00229c43d957-c2f6-4bb1-a02e-58babf844b7c\u0022\u003eDeadline extended again\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe weeks leading up to the October 31 deadline were quite chaotic, as Boris Johnson was in a race against time to get a revised Brexit deal approved. Though he did manage to convince the EU to accept a few small changes from Theresa May\u0026rsquo;s failed deal, he then had to convince Parliament to vote for it within a very short time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, though Parliament did not directly vote against Johnson\u0026rsquo;s deal, they did vote against his accelerated time schedule for passing the deal, which led Johnson to abandon his hopes of meeting the deadline and instead seek a general election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause Parliament had previously passed the so-called \u003cstrong\u003eBenn Act\u003c/strong\u003e, Johnson was forced to ask the EU for a further deadline extension rather than letting the UK face a no-deal Brexit. This marked a major political defeat for Johnson, who had previously been very insistent that the UK would leave the EU on the October deadline, regardless of whether a deal had been struck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter further complications and negotiations, the EU agreed to a new Brexit deadline on \u003cstrong\u003eJanuary 31, 2020\u003c/strong\u003e. Furthermore, the UK is now scheduled to have a \u003cstrong\u003egeneral election\u003c/strong\u003e on December 12, 2019 \u0026ndash; letting the British people decide whether the Conservative Party should still be in charge of the Brexit process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe January 31 deadline is a so-called \u0026lsquo;\u003cstrong\u003eflextension\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026rsquo;, which means that the UK can technically leave the EU at an earlier date if a withdrawal agreement is approved by both the EU and Parliament. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Brexit negotiations","MetaDescription":"Article 50 of the European Union Treaty gives any country that wants to leave the Union the right to two years in which to negotiate the exit terms.
