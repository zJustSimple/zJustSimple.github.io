These renegotiated terms were reached in early 2016. However, there were no significant changes in the EU-UK relationship apart from the already established opt-outs and the UK rebate. At the same time, Parliament had already approved the referendum and campaigning had already started.</p><p>The official group which was approved to organise the<strong> Remain campaign</strong> was <strong>Britain Stronger in Europe</strong>, while <strong>Vote Leave</strong> was the group which organised the <strong>Leave campaign</strong>.</p><p>The Remain campaign was mostly supported by liberals and members of the Labour Party, while <strong>the Conservative Party was split on the issue</strong>. The Leave campaign was supported by Euro-sceptics and some Conservatives, including MP Boris Johnson who became a frontman for Vote Leave.</p><p>The Conservative Prime Minister supported the Remain campaign, but the members of his party were free to endorse whichever campaign they agreed with. In general, the Conservative Party as a whole adopted a neutral position, avoiding getting too involved in any of the campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the two official campaigns, UKIP organised a separate campaign aimed at persuading voters to opt for leaving the EU. Their campaign was titled Leave EU.</p><p>Each campaign was further endorsed by different business, media, and trade unions, leading to both campaigns having support across all segments of society.</p><p>The referendum was organised for <strong>23<sup>rd</sup> of June, 2016</strong>. The results of the polls revealed that <strong>the Leave campaign won with 51.9% of the votes</strong>. In total, it is estimated that about 30 million people voted in the referendum, making up 71.8% of the total British voters.</p><p>However, the results were different from country to country. A majority of people in England and Wales voted for Leave: 53.4% in England and 52.5% in Wales. But in Northern Ireland and Scotland, a majority of voters sided with the Remain campaign: 62% in Scotland and 55.8% in Northern Ireland. <strong>It is also notable that the majority of people in London &ndash; a highly globalised city with many connections to other nations &ndash; voted to Remain in the EU</strong>.</p><p>There were also significant differences in voters&rsquo; preference according to <strong>age and education</strong>. According to a YouGov survey, most Remain voters were young people holding a higher education degree. By contrast, most people who voted Leave were over 50 years old or did not hold a higher education degree.</p><p>The referendum was not legally binding, meaning that the government was not legally obliged to act according to the results of the popular vote. However, after PM David Cameron resigned, his successor, <strong>Theresa May started the withdrawal process on 29<sup>th</sup> of March, 2017</strong>. According to EU rules, this gave the UK <strong>two years</strong> to negotiate the terms of leaving the European Union.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="fbd9e00d-5353-4f37-8b52-d942f8a4628c">The Remain campaign</h2><p>During the campaign for the Brexit referendum, the Remain campaign argued in favour of the UK staying in the EU by focusing on the economic and political advantages of EU membership.</p><p>One argument was that leaving the EU would mean that <strong>the UK would lose many trade benefits</strong> that it has with neighbouring countries, thanks to the Single Market. In turn, this would also affect the country&rsquo;s negotiation advantages with other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Another argument put forward by the Remain side was that <strong>UK might lose its status as a financial centre</strong> of the world because it will no longer have &lsquo;entrance to the EU&rsquo;, something which attracted financial investors and banks from US and other non-EU countries.</p><p>The campaigners also argued that <strong>trading some sovereignty with the EU was a win-win situation</strong>, because it also allowed the UK to be able to have a voice at negotiations both in the EU and outside the EU. At the same time, they pointed out that the UK leaving the EU does not mean more sovereignty as the country is also bound to other international organisations such as the UN, NATO or WTO.</p><p>The Remain Campaign also tried to focus on the <strong>positive aspects of immigration</strong>. Campaigners agreed that immigration does raise challenges but also pointed out that it can have positive social and economic outcomes. Furthermore, they argued that leaving the EU would not stop global immigration trends from affecting the UK. &nbsp;Additionally, leaving the EU would lead to a shortage of workers for jobs that are now typically performed by immigrants, such as essential roles in the National Health Service.</p><p>Another Remain argument was that leaving the EU would <strong>lead to people losing jobs related to trade with the EU</strong>. Furthermore, they suggested that more jobs could be lost if trade and investments shrink after Brexit.</p><p>Yet another argument related to the issue <strong>of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland</strong>. This has historically been a &lsquo;soft border&rsquo; with little control and bureaucracy, thanks to the Good Friday peace agreement that put an end to <a href="https://www.studienet.se/ireland/the-troubles">the Troubles</a>. In the event of Brexit, however, it would be hard to maintain such a soft border, as people and goods would now be travelling in and out of the EU when crossing the border, which would require much more strict control. The Irish border issue would later turn out to be one of the main difficulties when trying to create an acceptable Brexit agreement. &nbsp;</p><p>Finally, campaigners argued that leaving the EU would result in <strong>losing political influence</strong> in Europe, and affect the UK as a global political power.</p><p>As you can see, most of the arguments put forward by the Remain&nbsp;campaign focused on the negative impact that Brexit would have on the UK. Because of this, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36377201">some sections of the media called the campaign &ldquo;Project Fear&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="22c6a93e-5e1a-4c4d-aafe-6de2d65c63b9">The Leave campaign</h2><p>The Leave campaign convinced voters to opt for leaving the EU using arguments related to immigration, the economy, bureaucracy and British independence.</p><p>For example, campaigners argued that <strong>leaving the EU would save the UK money</strong> because it would no longer contribute to the EU budget. According to 2016 data, the UK paid £13.1bn pounds towards the EU, that campaigners argued could be used internally. Specifically, they used the argument that the money could be spent on the National Health Service (NHS). Nevertheless many of the figures they put forward were fact checked and proved inaccurate. For example, in 2016, the UK also <i>received </i>£4.5bn from the EU. Consequently, the real contribution to the EU budget was smaller &ndash; £8.5bn. The Leave campaign later had to withdraw their claims about the huge amount of money that could potentially be spent on the NHS upon leaving the EU.</p><p>At the same time, campaigners overlooked the fact that <a href="https://qz.com/1134703/brexit-divorce-bill-explained-why-the-uk-needs-to-pay-the-eu-to-leave/">leaving the EU would also have a lot of immediate costs which were estimated at about 40bn euros.</a></p><p>The Leave Campaign also argued that while UK might lose the trade framework of the Single Market, this would also mean that <strong>the country is free to establish its own trade deals</strong> which could be more advantageous.</p><p>Similarly, the campaigners responded to concerns about financial and economic aspects by arguing that the <strong>UK will be free from EU regulations</strong> <strong>and bureaucracy</strong>, and thus might re-invent itself as an independent, strong economy such as Singapore.</p><p>A key argument for leaving the EU put forward by campaigners was related to sovereignty. In their view, <strong>giving up some sovereignty</strong> to the EU is never worth it. Campaigners argues that after leaving the EU, there would be no interfering in domestic and foreign policies established by the UK.</p><p>Many campaigners claimed that leaving the EU would lead to <strong>a dramatic drop in immigration</strong> and allow the UK to have control over its borders. This argument was often rejected by the Remain campaign, so some of Leave campaigners simply argued that even if immigration were not reduced, the UK would be free to set its own rules regarding the movement of people.</p><p>Although the UK is not a member of the Eurozone, campaigners still used the argument of the euro being an economic disaster to suggest that the <strong>EU is inefficient</strong> and does not create economic progress.</p><p>Finally, Leavers also argued that by leaving the EU, the <strong>UK could become an independent, powerful political voice in the world again</strong>.</p><div class="toggle-box"><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text">Textual perspective - Boris Johnson's Speech on the EU Referendum</span><div class="toggle-box-handle">&nbsp;</div></header><div class="toggle-box-content"><p>The Conservative Boris Johnson was&nbsp;one of the most prominent supporters of the Leave campaign.

These renegotiated terms were reached in early 2016. However, there were no significant changes in the EU-UK relationship apart from the already established opt-outs and the UK rebate. At the same time, Parliament had already approved the referendum and campaigning had already started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe official group which was approved to organise the\u003cstrong\u003e Remain campaign\u003c/strong\u003e was \u003cstrong\u003eBritain Stronger in Europe\u003c/strong\u003e, while \u003cstrong\u003eVote Leave\u003c/strong\u003e was the group which organised the \u003cstrong\u003eLeave campaign\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Remain campaign was mostly supported by liberals and members of the Labour Party, while \u003cstrong\u003ethe Conservative Party was split on the issue\u003c/strong\u003e. The Leave campaign was supported by Euro-sceptics and some Conservatives, including MP Boris Johnson who became a frontman for Vote Leave.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Conservative Prime Minister supported the Remain campaign, but the members of his party were free to endorse whichever campaign they agreed with. In general, the Conservative Party as a whole adopted a neutral position, avoiding getting too involved in any of the campaigns.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApart from the two official campaigns, UKIP organised a separate campaign aimed at persuading voters to opt for leaving the EU. Their campaign was titled Leave EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach campaign was further endorsed by different business, media, and trade unions, leading to both campaigns having support across all segments of society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe referendum was organised for \u003cstrong\u003e23\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e of June, 2016\u003c/strong\u003e. The results of the polls revealed that \u003cstrong\u003ethe Leave campaign won with 51.9% of the votes\u003c/strong\u003e. In total, it is estimated that about 30 million people voted in the referendum, making up 71.8% of the total British voters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the results were different from country to country. A majority of people in England and Wales voted for Leave: 53.4% in England and 52.5% in Wales. But in Northern Ireland and Scotland, a majority of voters sided with the Remain campaign: 62% in Scotland and 55.8% in Northern Ireland. \u003cstrong\u003eIt is also notable that the majority of people in London \u0026ndash; a highly globalised city with many connections to other nations \u0026ndash; voted to Remain in the EU\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were also significant differences in voters\u0026rsquo; preference according to \u003cstrong\u003eage and education\u003c/strong\u003e. According to a YouGov survey, most Remain voters were young people holding a higher education degree. By contrast, most people who voted Leave were over 50 years old or did not hold a higher education degree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe referendum was not legally binding, meaning that the government was not legally obliged to act according to the results of the popular vote. However, after PM David Cameron resigned, his successor, \u003cstrong\u003eTheresa May started the withdrawal process on 29\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of March, 2017\u003c/strong\u003e. According to EU rules, this gave the UK \u003cstrong\u003etwo years\u003c/strong\u003e to negotiate the terms of leaving the European Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022fbd9e00d-5353-4f37-8b52-d942f8a4628c\u0022\u003eThe Remain campaign\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the campaign for the Brexit referendum, the Remain campaign argued in favour of the UK staying in the EU by focusing on the economic and political advantages of EU membership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne argument was that leaving the EU would mean that \u003cstrong\u003ethe UK would lose many trade benefits\u003c/strong\u003e that it has with neighbouring countries, thanks to the Single Market. In turn, this would also affect the country\u0026rsquo;s negotiation advantages with other parts of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother argument put forward by the Remain side was that \u003cstrong\u003eUK might lose its status as a financial centre\u003c/strong\u003e of the world because it will no longer have \u0026lsquo;entrance to the EU\u0026rsquo;, something which attracted financial investors and banks from US and other non-EU countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe campaigners also argued that \u003cstrong\u003etrading some sovereignty with the EU was a win-win situation\u003c/strong\u003e, because it also allowed the UK to be able to have a voice at negotiations both in the EU and outside the EU. At the same time, they pointed out that the UK leaving the EU does not mean more sovereignty as the country is also bound to other international organisations such as the UN, NATO or WTO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Remain Campaign also tried to focus on the \u003cstrong\u003epositive aspects of immigration\u003c/strong\u003e. Campaigners agreed that immigration does raise challenges but also pointed out that it can have positive social and economic outcomes. Furthermore, they argued that leaving the EU would not stop global immigration trends from affecting the UK. \u0026nbsp;Additionally, leaving the EU would lead to a shortage of workers for jobs that are now typically performed by immigrants, such as essential roles in the National Health Service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother Remain argument was that leaving the EU would \u003cstrong\u003elead to people losing jobs related to trade with the EU\u003c/strong\u003e. Furthermore, they suggested that more jobs could be lost if trade and investments shrink after Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet another argument related to the issue \u003cstrong\u003eof the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland\u003c/strong\u003e. This has historically been a \u0026lsquo;soft border\u0026rsquo; with little control and bureaucracy, thanks to the Good Friday peace agreement that put an end to \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/ireland/the-troubles\u0022\u003ethe Troubles\u003c/a\u003e. In the event of Brexit, however, it would be hard to maintain such a soft border, as people and goods would now be travelling in and out of the EU when crossing the border, which would require much more strict control. The Irish border issue would later turn out to be one of the main difficulties when trying to create an acceptable Brexit agreement. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, campaigners argued that leaving the EU would result in \u003cstrong\u003elosing political influence\u003c/strong\u003e in Europe, and affect the UK as a global political power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, most of the arguments put forward by the Remain\u0026nbsp;campaign focused on the negative impact that Brexit would have on the UK. Because of this, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36377201\u0022\u003esome sections of the media called the campaign \u0026ldquo;Project Fear\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002222c6a93e-5e1a-4c4d-aafe-6de2d65c63b9\u0022\u003eThe Leave campaign\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Leave campaign convinced voters to opt for leaving the EU using arguments related to immigration, the economy, bureaucracy and British independence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, campaigners argued that \u003cstrong\u003eleaving the EU would save the UK money\u003c/strong\u003e because it would no longer contribute to the EU budget. According to 2016 data, the UK paid £13.1bn pounds towards the EU, that campaigners argued could be used internally. Specifically, they used the argument that the money could be spent on the National Health Service (NHS). Nevertheless many of the figures they put forward were fact checked and proved inaccurate. For example, in 2016, the UK also \u003ci\u003ereceived \u003c/i\u003e£4.5bn from the EU. Consequently, the real contribution to the EU budget was smaller \u0026ndash; £8.5bn. The Leave campaign later had to withdraw their claims about the huge amount of money that could potentially be spent on the NHS upon leaving the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, campaigners overlooked the fact that \u003ca href=\u0022https://qz.com/1134703/brexit-divorce-bill-explained-why-the-uk-needs-to-pay-the-eu-to-leave/\u0022\u003eleaving the EU would also have a lot of immediate costs which were estimated at about 40bn euros.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Leave Campaign also argued that while UK might lose the trade framework of the Single Market, this would also mean that \u003cstrong\u003ethe country is free to establish its own trade deals\u003c/strong\u003e which could be more advantageous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, the campaigners responded to concerns about financial and economic aspects by arguing that the \u003cstrong\u003eUK will be free from EU regulations\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand bureaucracy\u003c/strong\u003e, and thus might re-invent itself as an independent, strong economy such as Singapore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA key argument for leaving the EU put forward by campaigners was related to sovereignty. In their view, \u003cstrong\u003egiving up some sovereignty\u003c/strong\u003e to the EU is never worth it. Campaigners argues that after leaving the EU, there would be no interfering in domestic and foreign policies established by the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany campaigners claimed that leaving the EU would lead to \u003cstrong\u003ea dramatic drop in immigration\u003c/strong\u003e and allow the UK to have control over its borders. This argument was often rejected by the Remain campaign, so some of Leave campaigners simply argued that even if immigration were not reduced, the UK would be free to set its own rules regarding the movement of people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the UK is not a member of the Eurozone, campaigners still used the argument of the euro being an economic disaster to suggest that the \u003cstrong\u003eEU is inefficient\u003c/strong\u003e and does not create economic progress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, Leavers also argued that by leaving the EU, the \u003cstrong\u003eUK could become an independent, powerful political voice in the world again\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022\u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022\u003eTextual perspective - Boris Johnson\u0027s Speech on the EU Referendum\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Conservative Boris Johnson was\u0026nbsp;one of the most prominent supporters of the Leave campaign.
