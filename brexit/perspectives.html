Also, most of Ireland&rsquo;s trade is with the UK.</p><p>Other consequences of Brexit for EU countries could include issues related to <strong>the movement of people</strong>. For example, there might be a lot of people who return to their own home countries from the UK or who wish to move to other countries that are still in the EU. This would mean increased migration inside the EU.</p><p>There might also be <strong>more pressure on the EU to deal with migrants from outside the Union</strong>. For example, in France at Calais there are many immigrants who try to reach the UK. There is currently an agreement between France and the UK to manage the situation, but the agreement might be cancelled when the UK leaves, leaving France to manage the area on its own.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brexit vote has also <strong>influenced anti-immigration parties</strong> throughout Europe. If they continue to grow in popularity in France or Germany, they might also push for anti-EU referendums in some years. If either France or Germany leave the EU, there is a risk that the union could dissolve.</p><p>Brexit has also fed the fears that some countries have of a German dominance in Europe. Italy, Poland and even some politicians in France are afraid that Germany will impose its views on European policies.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="c741744b-b818-4206-a704-7dead0d00433">US views on the EU and Brexit</h2><p>The UK has traditionally been the gateway to Europe for American business. Brexit will probably lead to a decrease in American investments in the UK, as US businesses will try to find other ways to access the EU market. However, this also depends on what kind of trade agreements the UK might be able to secure with the US following Brexit.</p><p>Views on the EU and Brexit since the referendum and up to now have been divided in America.</p><p>When the referendum was being organised, the US President Barack Obama clearly stated during a trip to London in April 2016 that <strong>he believed the UK should continue as part of the EU</strong>. At that time UKIP&rsquo;s Nigel Farage rejected Obama&rsquo;s views, controversially arguing that he is anti-British because he is of Kenyan descent.</p><p>Many policymakers in the US knew that the UK was an ally in many foreign policy issues and could influence other EU states to adopt US-friendly positions. After the referendum results, American policymakers fear the EU might relax sanctions on Russia and be less inclined to act towards the US in a friendly way.</p><p>However, it is also worth noting <strong>the Brexit referendum did not receive extensive attention in American media</strong>, mainly because 2016 was a presidential election year in the US. However, the media that did cover the topic tended to side with the Remain campaign and warned against the negative effects of Brexit.</p><p>The referendum gained more attention when the then presidential candidate <strong>Donald Trump visited Scotland and expressed his support for the Leave Campaign</strong>.</p><p>This is not surprising, as the Leave campaign and Donald Trump&rsquo;s electoral campaign shared some similarities. They were both based on strong anti-immigration and anti-globalisation rhetoric as well as on a strong criticism of existing trade agreements. Another point of similarity is that both campaigns had <strong>surprising outcomes</strong>. At the beginning of the electoral campaign few people believed Trump would win, but he did. Similarity, many thought the British referendum would be won by the Remain campaign, but they lost.</p><p>Also, there were <strong>allegations of Russian interference in both campaigns</strong>. In the US, Russia was accused of interfering in favour of Donald Trump through fake news and leaks. In the UK, <a target="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/russian-influence-brexit-vote-detailed-us-senate-report">there were suspicions that Russia influenced the outcome of the vote through social media</a>. These aspects are still being investigated.</p><p>Because of Trump&rsquo;s declared support for Brexit, many in Britain believed that if Trump became president he would help speed up a trade-deal with the UK. However, since Trump has become president he has shown no intent to fast-track such an agreement. On the contrary, he raised steel tariffs for all trade partners and has even threatened a strike against imported automobiles. Given that Britain exports a lot of cars to the US, it does not seem like Trump is going to do any favours to the UK.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="7764b713-da67-4557-9286-45d7ec7afdfd">Other countries which have&nbsp;considered leaving the EU</h2><p>In the history of the EU, there have been <strong>no joining members that left the union until the UK</strong>. However there have been some territories of member states that did leave the EU once they gained independence or autonomy.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, as a French territory Algeria was part of the European Economic Community from 1957 to 1962. However, when it became an independent state it withdrew from the EEC.</p><p>A similar example was that of <strong>Greenland</strong>. Since it was part of Denmark, Greenland entered the EU when Denmark joined the community. However, in 1985, after Greenland gained independence, a referendum was organised on the island regarding European membership. The people of Greenland voted against and Greenland went through a negotiation process with the then European Economic Community.</p><p>However, Greenland remains connected to the EU in many ways because of its still close association with Denmark &ndash; for example, Greenlandic people are still legally considered citizens of the EU and can travel freely within it. The situation is therefore not fully comparable to Brexit.</p><p>In more recent years, there has been talk about other countries leaving the EU. The most relevant example is that of <strong>Greece</strong>, which&nbsp;entered a severe economic crisis and&nbsp;wanted to give up the euro currency in 2015. Greece also threatened to leave the EU when the Union demanded that the country implement strict financial policies in return for the EU&rsquo;s financial aid. Additionally, most Greeks seem to be against the EU,&nbsp; <a target="" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/07/5-facts-about-greece-and-the-eu/">according to Pew Research polls</a>.</p><p>Far right parties in other European nations have also on occasion <strong>voiced their desire for new EU referendums</strong> in the wake of the Brexit decision, but most of them do not have sufficient political power to call such referendums&nbsp;and are usually opposed by the major parties of their respective nations, who tend to be more EU-positive. <a target="" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/14/germanys-afd-backs-away-dexit-call-frances-le-pen-pledges-reform/">Some far right parties have also backed away from the idea of leaving the EU</a>, however, perhaps as a reaction to the chaotic process that the&nbsp;UK is going through.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/brexit/the-future" title="The future of Brexit" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The future of Brexit</span></a><a href="/brexit/texts" title="Texts about Brexit" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Texts about Brexit</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Also, most of Ireland\u0026rsquo;s trade is with the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther consequences of Brexit for EU countries could include issues related to \u003cstrong\u003ethe movement of people\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, there might be a lot of people who return to their own home countries from the UK or who wish to move to other countries that are still in the EU. This would mean increased migration inside the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere might also be \u003cstrong\u003emore pressure on the EU to deal with migrants from outside the Union\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, in France at Calais there are many immigrants who try to reach the UK. There is currently an agreement between France and the UK to manage the situation, but the agreement might be cancelled when the UK leaves, leaving France to manage the area on its own.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Brexit vote has also \u003cstrong\u003einfluenced anti-immigration parties\u003c/strong\u003e throughout Europe. If they continue to grow in popularity in France or Germany, they might also push for anti-EU referendums in some years. If either France or Germany leave the EU, there is a risk that the union could dissolve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBrexit has also fed the fears that some countries have of a German dominance in Europe. Italy, Poland and even some politicians in France are afraid that Germany will impose its views on European policies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c741744b-b818-4206-a704-7dead0d00433\u0022\u003eUS views on the EU and Brexit\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK has traditionally been the gateway to Europe for American business. Brexit will probably lead to a decrease in American investments in the UK, as US businesses will try to find other ways to access the EU market. However, this also depends on what kind of trade agreements the UK might be able to secure with the US following Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eViews on the EU and Brexit since the referendum and up to now have been divided in America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the referendum was being organised, the US President Barack Obama clearly stated during a trip to London in April 2016 that \u003cstrong\u003ehe believed the UK should continue as part of the EU\u003c/strong\u003e. At that time UKIP\u0026rsquo;s Nigel Farage rejected Obama\u0026rsquo;s views, controversially arguing that he is anti-British because he is of Kenyan descent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany policymakers in the US knew that the UK was an ally in many foreign policy issues and could influence other EU states to adopt US-friendly positions. After the referendum results, American policymakers fear the EU might relax sanctions on Russia and be less inclined to act towards the US in a friendly way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, it is also worth noting \u003cstrong\u003ethe Brexit referendum did not receive extensive attention in American media\u003c/strong\u003e, mainly because 2016 was a presidential election year in the US. However, the media that did cover the topic tended to side with the Remain campaign and warned against the negative effects of Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe referendum gained more attention when the then presidential candidate \u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump visited Scotland and expressed his support for the Leave Campaign\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is not surprising, as the Leave campaign and Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s electoral campaign shared some similarities. They were both based on strong anti-immigration and anti-globalisation rhetoric as well as on a strong criticism of existing trade agreements. Another point of similarity is that both campaigns had \u003cstrong\u003esurprising outcomes\u003c/strong\u003e. At the beginning of the electoral campaign few people believed Trump would win, but he did. Similarity, many thought the British referendum would be won by the Remain campaign, but they lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, there were \u003cstrong\u003eallegations of Russian interference in both campaigns\u003c/strong\u003e. In the US, Russia was accused of interfering in favour of Donald Trump through fake news and leaks. In the UK, \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/russian-influence-brexit-vote-detailed-us-senate-report\u0022\u003ethere were suspicions that Russia influenced the outcome of the vote through social media\u003c/a\u003e. These aspects are still being investigated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of Trump\u0026rsquo;s declared support for Brexit, many in Britain believed that if Trump became president he would help speed up a trade-deal with the UK. However, since Trump has become president he has shown no intent to fast-track such an agreement. On the contrary, he raised steel tariffs for all trade partners and has even threatened a strike against imported automobiles. Given that Britain exports a lot of cars to the US, it does not seem like Trump is going to do any favours to the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00227764b713-da67-4557-9286-45d7ec7afdfd\u0022\u003eOther countries which have\u0026nbsp;considered leaving the EU\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the history of the EU, there have been \u003cstrong\u003eno joining members that left the union until the UK\u003c/strong\u003e. However there have been some territories of member states that did leave the EU once they gained independence or autonomy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, as a French territory Algeria was part of the European Economic Community from 1957 to 1962. However, when it became an independent state it withdrew from the EEC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA similar example was that of \u003cstrong\u003eGreenland\u003c/strong\u003e. Since it was part of Denmark, Greenland entered the EU when Denmark joined the community. However, in 1985, after Greenland gained independence, a referendum was organised on the island regarding European membership. The people of Greenland voted against and Greenland went through a negotiation process with the then European Economic Community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Greenland remains connected to the EU in many ways because of its still close association with Denmark \u0026ndash; for example, Greenlandic people are still legally considered citizens of the EU and can travel freely within it. The situation is therefore not fully comparable to Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn more recent years, there has been talk about other countries leaving the EU. The most relevant example is that of \u003cstrong\u003eGreece\u003c/strong\u003e, which\u0026nbsp;entered a severe economic crisis and\u0026nbsp;wanted to give up the euro currency in 2015. Greece also threatened to leave the EU when the Union demanded that the country implement strict financial policies in return for the EU\u0026rsquo;s financial aid. Additionally, most Greeks seem to be against the EU,\u0026nbsp; \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/07/5-facts-about-greece-and-the-eu/\u0022\u003eaccording to Pew Research polls\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFar right parties in other European nations have also on occasion \u003cstrong\u003evoiced their desire for new EU referendums\u003c/strong\u003e in the wake of the Brexit decision, but most of them do not have sufficient political power to call such referendums\u0026nbsp;and are usually opposed by the major parties of their respective nations, who tend to be more EU-positive. \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/14/germanys-afd-backs-away-dexit-call-frances-le-pen-pledges-reform/\u0022\u003eSome far right parties have also backed away from the idea of leaving the EU\u003c/a\u003e, however, perhaps as a reaction to the chaotic process that the\u0026nbsp;UK is going through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Putting Brexit into perspective","MetaDescription":"The UK leaving the EU will not only have effects on the UK, but also on other EU countries.
