While the UK has a central government, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have local governments with different powers and attributes.</p><p>Politically, the UK is organised as a constitutional monarchy and a unitary parliamentary democracy. In a constitutional monarchy, the head of the state is the monarch but his/her powers and authority are established by the constitution (although in this case Britain does not have a written constitution). Queen Elizabeth II is the current monarch of the UK.</p><p>In a parliamentary democracy, members of the parliament need to be elected by the people. As a unitary state, the UK has a central government with supreme powers. Only the central government can decide how much power it delegates to other administrative divisions (such as to the other constituent countries).</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="d169632f-c6d5-43c3-8a13-a39b1a9518c8">The UK&rsquo;s early relationship with the EU</h2><p>When the European Economic Community (EEC) was formed in 1957, the UK was not a member. Its first attempts to join the EEC came in 1963 and 1967. However, each time France vetoed the UK&rsquo;s membership. This was because the French President, Charles de Gaulle, believed the UK&rsquo;s economy and views on a potential union of Europe were incompatible with what the other EEC members wanted.</p><p>As a result, the UK&rsquo;s membership of the EEC was only accepted after de Gaulle was no longer president. The Treaty of Accession was signed in 1972 and the UK became a member of the EEC in 1973. At that time the UK had a Conservative government.</p><p>The Labour Party campaigned heavily on this topic in the general elections of 1974, because the British people were not asked their opinion before the UK applied for EEC membership.</p><p>The Labour Party was not a strong supporter of European integration at that time, and feared that the prices of food in the EEC would have a negative impact on the prices of food on the Commonwealth markets (former states of the British Empire).</p><p>In the 1974 elections, Labour promised to renegotiate the terms of the UK being a member of EEC and to organise a referendum to ask the British people whether they agreed with their country continuing in the EEC under the new negotiated terms.</p><p>At that time, public opinion, the media and most political parties generally supported membership of the European Community. The referendum passed with 67% of the votes in favour of staying in the EEC.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="afdfaf1a-809c-4321-b8ee-3782967053ad">Opt outs from EU policies</h2><p>Throughout its membership in the European community - which later turned into the European Union - the UK often opted out of certain norms and policies implemented by the EU, utilising a right that all EU countries have.</p><p>For example, in 1979, the UK opted out of the Economic and Monetary Union which would later lead to the creation of the Euro. As a result the UK had no obligation to adopt the euro, or join the Banking Union. At the same time, the UK also has no voting rights when it comes to issues related to the Eurozone.</p><p>Under Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s government, the UK also negotiated a budget rebate, meaning that the UK began to contribute less to the EU budget.</p><p>Later the UK opted out of the Schengen border-free area, which means that the country still has control over its own borders. For examples, visitors to the UK still get their passport checked, even when travelling from the EU.</p><p>Another example of the UK opting out from EU policies concerns Justice and Home Affairs. Under a protocol with the EU, the UK has the right to choose to which measures in Justice and Home Affairs it will participate in.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the UK has obtained a clarification that says the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights cannot give the European Court of Justice the right to influence British law. The UK feared that labour law in the country could come in conflict with Charter articles.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="d040eb4f-c89e-41a0-80cf-7dc3861cfd46">Growing Euro-scepticism</h2><p>Even with opt-outs, after the 1990s Euro-scepticism began to grow in Britain. Euro-scepticism can be broadly defined as the rejection of or opposition to EU policies and institutions, and may go as far as opposing membership to the Union.</p><p>In 1985, the UK signed the Single European Act which would create the Single European Market by 1992.</p><p>In 1990, criticism grew when Margaret Thatcher signed the UK into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which tied the pound to the deutschmark. Soon after, the PM resigned, partly because she started to hold Euro-sceptic views. Eventually, the UK withdrew from the ERM in 1992 when the pound crashed because of currency speculations.</p><p>When the Maastricht Treaty was signed (1992), creating the European Union in 1993, Euro-scepticism was well underway in the UK. For example, a referendum Party was created in the UK which campaigned in 1997 to contest the elections, promising people a referendum on the EU membership. However, the party failed because it did not get many votes.</p><p>The UK Independence Party (UKIP), another euro-sceptic party, was formed in 1993. UKIP was openly against the EU from the start, and also held &nbsp;strongly right-wing views. However, it only started to become more popular in 2004 when it came third in the European Parliament Elections in the UK. By 2014, the party came first in the European Parliament Elections, beating traditional winners like Labour and Conservative. It was this success that started to put pressure on the UK government to organise an EU referendum.</p><p>Many link the growing Euro-scepticism with the Treaty of Maastricht, because these anti-EU feelings started to grow soon after the EU was formed. This was in part also due to the failure of European integration when a treaty establishing an EU constitution was rejected.</p><p><a target="" href="http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-33/euroscepticism.aspx">The British Social Attitudes (BSA) surveys</a>&nbsp;show an increase in Euro-scepticism in the UK from 38% (1993) to 65% (2015), referring only to opposition to EU policies.</p><p>It is important to note that when the country first joined the EEC in the 1970s, the Labour Party was more Eurosceptic than the Conservative Party. These positions had started to shift by mid-1980s. Gradually, Euro-scepticism increasingly started to influence the Conservative Party. For example, the 2001 elections for a new leader of the Conservatives were won by Iain Duncan Smith, who was considered more Eurosceptic than his rivals.</p><p>In general, British politicians have always preferred the idea of equal cooperation between European governments rather than the EU acting as a central&nbsp;authority. This is why they rejected the idea of the European Monetary Union and preferred the creation of a Single Market. They also generally promote concepts of national defence and national sovereignty and thus are more inclined to perceive certain EU policies as damaging to these values.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="40ad94b2-a63a-424b-9606-818a148c961f">Pros and cons of EU membership</h2><p>There is little consensus between British politicians about the benefits and disadvantages of being an EU member. Some of the most debated pros and cons include:</p><p>A main advantage of being part of The EU was the <strong>access to European Funds</strong>. These funds can help businesses, and promote economic development in areas that have high unemployment or which are underdeveloped. EU funds helped development in many areas of the UK, including Northern Ireland, the Scottish islands or west Wales.</p><p>Another advantage of EU membership is the <strong>freedom to trade and work</strong>. Thanks to the European Single Market, the EU has become the world&rsquo;s largest free trade region. This means that all EU members can sell goods and services without tariffs and restrictions. This in turn has led to lower business costs and new jobs. 67% of the UK&rsquo;s trade is within the EU.</p><p>Nevertheless, a main con with regards to the EU single market is <strong>bureaucracy</strong>. Some argue that trading in the EU also increases the burden of red tape because the EU imposes a large number of regulations regarding the standards in goods and services.</p><p>Another perceived disadvantage of the UK being a member of the EU is that the single market also implies the free movement of people, leading to <strong>increased immigration to the UK</strong>. For example, the UK has often worried about the influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe when countries in that area joined the EU. This concern was particularly played upon by right wing parties during the Brexit campaign.</p><p>The <strong>Common Agricultural Policy</strong> (CAP) has often been seen as a disadvantage for the UK, because even though the policy was reformed it did not prove very successful in helping the declining agricultural industry. Furthermore, the EU often implements prices that are artificially high, something the UK perceived as a disadvantage.</p><p>The higher prices encourage oversupply, while the CAP costs the EU taxpayers a lot. The UK has often complained that while they contribute a lot to CAP, most of the money actually goes to French farmers, because the UK agriculture is more compact and more efficient and cannot benefit from the funds as much as others.</p><p>Another con for the UK being a member of the EU is that the <strong>British pay more for utilities</strong>. This is because foreign companies can buy British utility companies and establish new, higher prices. Also, some members of the British public think the EU&rsquo;s renewable energy policies lead to people paying more for their water and energy bills.</p><p>At the same time, some argue that the EU&rsquo;s environmental policies actually lead to creating more jobs and making the EU a leader in the world when it comes to renewable energy.

While the UK has a central government, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have local governments with different powers and attributes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitically, the UK is organised as a constitutional monarchy and a unitary parliamentary democracy. In a constitutional monarchy, the head of the state is the monarch but his/her powers and authority are established by the constitution (although in this case Britain does not have a written constitution). Queen Elizabeth II is the current monarch of the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a parliamentary democracy, members of the parliament need to be elected by the people. As a unitary state, the UK has a central government with supreme powers. Only the central government can decide how much power it delegates to other administrative divisions (such as to the other constituent countries).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d169632f-c6d5-43c3-8a13-a39b1a9518c8\u0022\u003eThe UK\u0026rsquo;s early relationship with the EU\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the European Economic Community (EEC) was formed in 1957, the UK was not a member. Its first attempts to join the EEC came in 1963 and 1967. However, each time France vetoed the UK\u0026rsquo;s membership. This was because the French President, Charles de Gaulle, believed the UK\u0026rsquo;s economy and views on a potential union of Europe were incompatible with what the other EEC members wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a result, the UK\u0026rsquo;s membership of the EEC was only accepted after de Gaulle was no longer president. The Treaty of Accession was signed in 1972 and the UK became a member of the EEC in 1973. At that time the UK had a Conservative government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Labour Party campaigned heavily on this topic in the general elections of 1974, because the British people were not asked their opinion before the UK applied for EEC membership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Labour Party was not a strong supporter of European integration at that time, and feared that the prices of food in the EEC would have a negative impact on the prices of food on the Commonwealth markets (former states of the British Empire).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 1974 elections, Labour promised to renegotiate the terms of the UK being a member of EEC and to organise a referendum to ask the British people whether they agreed with their country continuing in the EEC under the new negotiated terms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that time, public opinion, the media and most political parties generally supported membership of the European Community. The referendum passed with 67% of the votes in favour of staying in the EEC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022afdfaf1a-809c-4321-b8ee-3782967053ad\u0022\u003eOpt outs from EU policies\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout its membership in the European community - which later turned into the European Union - the UK often opted out of certain norms and policies implemented by the EU, utilising a right that all EU countries have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, in 1979, the UK opted out of the Economic and Monetary Union which would later lead to the creation of the Euro. As a result the UK had no obligation to adopt the euro, or join the Banking Union. At the same time, the UK also has no voting rights when it comes to issues related to the Eurozone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder Margaret Thatcher\u0026rsquo;s government, the UK also negotiated a budget rebate, meaning that the UK began to contribute less to the EU budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater the UK opted out of the Schengen border-free area, which means that the country still has control over its own borders. For examples, visitors to the UK still get their passport checked, even when travelling from the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example of the UK opting out from EU policies concerns Justice and Home Affairs. Under a protocol with the EU, the UK has the right to choose to which measures in Justice and Home Affairs it will participate in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the UK has obtained a clarification that says the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights cannot give the European Court of Justice the right to influence British law. The UK feared that labour law in the country could come in conflict with Charter articles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d040eb4f-c89e-41a0-80cf-7dc3861cfd46\u0022\u003eGrowing Euro-scepticism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven with opt-outs, after the 1990s Euro-scepticism began to grow in Britain. Euro-scepticism can be broadly defined as the rejection of or opposition to EU policies and institutions, and may go as far as opposing membership to the Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1985, the UK signed the Single European Act which would create the Single European Market by 1992.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1990, criticism grew when Margaret Thatcher signed the UK into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which tied the pound to the deutschmark. Soon after, the PM resigned, partly because she started to hold Euro-sceptic views. Eventually, the UK withdrew from the ERM in 1992 when the pound crashed because of currency speculations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the Maastricht Treaty was signed (1992), creating the European Union in 1993, Euro-scepticism was well underway in the UK. For example, a referendum Party was created in the UK which campaigned in 1997 to contest the elections, promising people a referendum on the EU membership. However, the party failed because it did not get many votes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), another euro-sceptic party, was formed in 1993. UKIP was openly against the EU from the start, and also held \u0026nbsp;strongly right-wing views. However, it only started to become more popular in 2004 when it came third in the European Parliament Elections in the UK. By 2014, the party came first in the European Parliament Elections, beating traditional winners like Labour and Conservative. It was this success that started to put pressure on the UK government to organise an EU referendum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany link the growing Euro-scepticism with the Treaty of Maastricht, because these anti-EU feelings started to grow soon after the EU was formed. This was in part also due to the failure of European integration when a treaty establishing an EU constitution was rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-33/euroscepticism.aspx\u0022\u003eThe British Social Attitudes (BSA) surveys\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;show an increase in Euro-scepticism in the UK from 38% (1993) to 65% (2015), referring only to opposition to EU policies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is important to note that when the country first joined the EEC in the 1970s, the Labour Party was more Eurosceptic than the Conservative Party. These positions had started to shift by mid-1980s. Gradually, Euro-scepticism increasingly started to influence the Conservative Party. For example, the 2001 elections for a new leader of the Conservatives were won by Iain Duncan Smith, who was considered more Eurosceptic than his rivals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, British politicians have always preferred the idea of equal cooperation between European governments rather than the EU acting as a central\u0026nbsp;authority. This is why they rejected the idea of the European Monetary Union and preferred the creation of a Single Market. They also generally promote concepts of national defence and national sovereignty and thus are more inclined to perceive certain EU policies as damaging to these values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u002240ad94b2-a63a-424b-9606-818a148c961f\u0022\u003ePros and cons of EU membership\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is little consensus between British politicians about the benefits and disadvantages of being an EU member. Some of the most debated pros and cons include:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA main advantage of being part of The EU was the \u003cstrong\u003eaccess to European Funds\u003c/strong\u003e. These funds can help businesses, and promote economic development in areas that have high unemployment or which are underdeveloped. EU funds helped development in many areas of the UK, including Northern Ireland, the Scottish islands or west Wales.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother advantage of EU membership is the \u003cstrong\u003efreedom to trade and work\u003c/strong\u003e. Thanks to the European Single Market, the EU has become the world\u0026rsquo;s largest free trade region. This means that all EU members can sell goods and services without tariffs and restrictions. This in turn has led to lower business costs and new jobs. 67% of the UK\u0026rsquo;s trade is within the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, a main con with regards to the EU single market is \u003cstrong\u003ebureaucracy\u003c/strong\u003e. Some argue that trading in the EU also increases the burden of red tape because the EU imposes a large number of regulations regarding the standards in goods and services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother perceived disadvantage of the UK being a member of the EU is that the single market also implies the free movement of people, leading to \u003cstrong\u003eincreased immigration to the UK\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, the UK has often worried about the influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe when countries in that area joined the EU. This concern was particularly played upon by right wing parties during the Brexit campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eCommon Agricultural Policy\u003c/strong\u003e (CAP) has often been seen as a disadvantage for the UK, because even though the policy was reformed it did not prove very successful in helping the declining agricultural industry. Furthermore, the EU often implements prices that are artificially high, something the UK perceived as a disadvantage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe higher prices encourage oversupply, while the CAP costs the EU taxpayers a lot. The UK has often complained that while they contribute a lot to CAP, most of the money actually goes to French farmers, because the UK agriculture is more compact and more efficient and cannot benefit from the funds as much as others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother con for the UK being a member of the EU is that the \u003cstrong\u003eBritish pay more for utilities\u003c/strong\u003e. This is because foreign companies can buy British utility companies and establish new, higher prices. Also, some members of the British public think the EU\u0026rsquo;s renewable energy policies lead to people paying more for their water and energy bills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, some argue that the EU\u0026rsquo;s environmental policies actually lead to creating more jobs and making the EU a leader in the world when it comes to renewable energy. As such the UK would want to be part of this in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Historical background of Brexit","MetaDescription":"The United Kingdom is formed of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
