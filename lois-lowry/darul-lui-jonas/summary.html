He lives happily in a well-organized, peaceful, and safe community where people are provided with everything they need to live. However, there is no longer any freedom of choice in this future society. Both people's private lives and their professional careers are regulated from birth to death, from morning to evening.</p><p>Spouses, children, and jobs are assigned by the Committee of Elders. Children are given to a family at the age of about one year. However, babies who do not develop well enough are released, as are offenders and the elderly when they reach a certain age.&nbsp;</p><p>Every December, the December Ceremonies are held, where something changes for the children. For example, the "Eights" have to complete volunteer hours and "Nines" receive a new bike. This continues util the children turn 12, when they are sent to train for their new vocation.</p><h2 id="heading-mvdlv" data-guid="69fd88e8-e5b2-4dae-b2d8-935a82849121">Jonas' training as the Receiver of Memory</h2><p>In the first part of the novel, Jonas' Ceremony of Twelve takes place. Jonas is interested in many things, which is why he has no idea what profession will be assigned to him. He is a bit anxious, but at the same time he trusts that the Elders will make a good choice for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas is surprised when he learns that he has been chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory. He doesn't know much about the Receiver at first, only that he is one of the Elders and has a very important role.</p><p>Jonas begins his training right after school, so he has no time to play with his friends. He soon learns from the old Receiver that his future role will isolate him from everyone else in the community. As the new Receiver of Memory, he will keep all the memories of the world within himself. In this way, he will keep the memories away from the people in the community and enable them to live a carefree life.&nbsp;</p><p>The old Receiver has gained wisdom through the memories and can warn the Elders of possible dangers, such as hunger and wars. However, it is rare that the Elders ask the Receiver for advice. During the training, the Receiver transmits the memories to Jonas. Therefore, he tells Jonas to call him the Giver.</p><p>Jonas was chosen for the role of the Receiver because he is intelligent and brave, but also because his sense of perception makes him receptive to the memories. In fact, it is a hard task to receive the memories and keep them inside.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas experiences beautiful memories during his first year of training, but he must also endure memories of physical and emotional pain. He must learn about worries, pain, and injuries. Jonas&rsquo; sense of duty motivates him to continue his training.</p><h2 id="heading-lgbou" data-guid="071bd6a4-8a85-41d5-ae81-ed10e0342d07">New insights and breach of trust</h2><p>Jonas develops and is enriched by the experiences transmitted to him: he learns from the Giver, for example, to see colors, learns about snow, mountains, sun, animals and seasons, all of which have been abolished in the community because of the principle of "Sameness". Finally, he also learns about love and warmth through the memories. These deep and genuine feelings can no longer be felt by the people in the community because they are suppressed with the help of medication.</p><p>Jonas' faith in his community shatters the day he learns from the Giver that releasing someone means killing them. In a video recording of a Ceremony for Release, Jonas sees his own father, who is a Nurturer, kill a new-born. From that moment on, Jonas realizes that he can no longer live in this community and wants to change it.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with the Receiver, Jonas makes a plan. Jonas is to escape with the help of the Receiver. They want to make it look as if Jonas has drowned in the river. The Receiver himself wants to stay behind. The memories Jonas has absorbed will all be released when he moves away from the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, the members of the community will be confronted with beautiful and painful experiences and will need the help of the Receiver to cope with the memories. The old Receiver knows this very well because it happened once before 10 years ago. His chosen successor Rosemary had broken off her training at that time and let herself be released. She was the Receiver&rsquo;s daughter.</p><h2 id="heading-ecoy0" data-guid="e0b2c876-5f7f-4da0-92f0-cf78b2cdc4a2">Gabriel and Jonas' escape</h2><p>At the beginning of the novel, Jonas' family has taken in a baby named Gabriel, who has not developed normally at the Nurturing Center. The Father has been given permission to take the baby home with him to his family in the evenings to train him to sleep through the night.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas and Gabriel form a close bond in the following months because the baby spends the nights in Jonas' bedroom. Jonas passed on some of the memories he received from the Giver to Gabriel so he could sleep well.&nbsp;</p><p>When Jonas returns home the evening after making the escape plan with the Receiver, he learns from his father that Gabriel is to be released the next day because he is still not sleeping through the night whenever he is at the Nurturing Center. Knowing now that releasing means that Gabriel will be killed, Jonas promptly decides to escape with him. It pains him greatly that he can no longer say goodbye to the Receiver he has grown to love as a father.&nbsp;</p><p>The next night, he rides away on his father's bicycle with Gabriel in the child's seat. Over the next few days, the two ride at night and hide during the day to avoid being discovered by search parties. They move far away from the community and encounter animals and experience how the weather changes. They end up in deep snow and have to cross a high mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas already believes that they will freeze or starve to death, but then they come to a place that he knows from his first memory that the Receiver transferred to him. It is the memory of a sled with which he can travel down the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas finds the sled and goes down the mountain with Gabriel. He is firmly convinced that there are people down on the mountain who will take them in and help them. As he descends, he hears music from below for the first time in his life, for music has also ceased to exist in his community. The novel has an open ending and it is not told what really waits for Jonas and Gabriel at the foot of the mountain after their heroic escape.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/lois-lowry/darul-lui-jonas/rezumat" title="Darul lui Jonas de Lois Lowry | Rezumat" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span></a><a href="/lois-lowry/darul-lui-jonas/book-review" title="The Giver - Book Review" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Book review</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

He lives happily in a well-organized, peaceful, and safe community where people are provided with everything they need to live. However, there is no longer any freedom of choice in this future society. Both people\u0027s private lives and their professional careers are regulated from birth to death, from morning to evening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpouses, children, and jobs are assigned by the Committee of Elders. Children are given to a family at the age of about one year. However, babies who do not develop well enough are released, as are offenders and the elderly when they reach a certain age.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery December, the December Ceremonies are held, where something changes for the children. For example, the \u0022Eights\u0022 have to complete volunteer hours and \u0022Nines\u0022 receive a new bike. This continues util the children turn 12, when they are sent to train for their new vocation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-mvdlv\u0022 data-guid=\u002269fd88e8-e5b2-4dae-b2d8-935a82849121\u0022\u003eJonas\u0027 training as the Receiver of Memory\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the first part of the novel, Jonas\u0027 Ceremony of Twelve takes place. Jonas is interested in many things, which is why he has no idea what profession will be assigned to him. He is a bit anxious, but at the same time he trusts that the Elders will make a good choice for him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas is surprised when he learns that he has been chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory. He doesn\u0027t know much about the Receiver at first, only that he is one of the Elders and has a very important role.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas begins his training right after school, so he has no time to play with his friends. He soon learns from the old Receiver that his future role will isolate him from everyone else in the community. As the new Receiver of Memory, he will keep all the memories of the world within himself. In this way, he will keep the memories away from the people in the community and enable them to live a carefree life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe old Receiver has gained wisdom through the memories and can warn the Elders of possible dangers, such as hunger and wars. However, it is rare that the Elders ask the Receiver for advice. During the training, the Receiver transmits the memories to Jonas. Therefore, he tells Jonas to call him the Giver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas was chosen for the role of the Receiver because he is intelligent and brave, but also because his sense of perception makes him receptive to the memories. In fact, it is a hard task to receive the memories and keep them inside.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas experiences beautiful memories during his first year of training, but he must also endure memories of physical and emotional pain. He must learn about worries, pain, and injuries. Jonas\u0026rsquo; sense of duty motivates him to continue his training.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-lgbou\u0022 data-guid=\u0022071bd6a4-8a85-41d5-ae81-ed10e0342d07\u0022\u003eNew insights and breach of trust\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas develops and is enriched by the experiences transmitted to him: he learns from the Giver, for example, to see colors, learns about snow, mountains, sun, animals and seasons, all of which have been abolished in the community because of the principle of \u0022Sameness\u0022. Finally, he also learns about love and warmth through the memories. These deep and genuine feelings can no longer be felt by the people in the community because they are suppressed with the help of medication.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027 faith in his community shatters the day he learns from the Giver that releasing someone means killing them. In a video recording of a Ceremony for Release, Jonas sees his own father, who is a Nurturer, kill a new-born. From that moment on, Jonas realizes that he can no longer live in this community and wants to change it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTogether with the Receiver, Jonas makes a plan. Jonas is to escape with the help of the Receiver. They want to make it look as if Jonas has drowned in the river. The Receiver himself wants to stay behind. The memories Jonas has absorbed will all be released when he moves away from the community.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsequently, the members of the community will be confronted with beautiful and painful experiences and will need the help of the Receiver to cope with the memories. The old Receiver knows this very well because it happened once before 10 years ago. His chosen successor Rosemary had broken off her training at that time and let herself be released. She was the Receiver\u0026rsquo;s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ecoy0\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e0b2c876-5f7f-4da0-92f0-cf78b2cdc4a2\u0022\u003eGabriel and Jonas\u0027 escape\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of the novel, Jonas\u0027 family has taken in a baby named Gabriel, who has not developed normally at the Nurturing Center. The Father has been given permission to take the baby home with him to his family in the evenings to train him to sleep through the night.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas and Gabriel form a close bond in the following months because the baby spends the nights in Jonas\u0027 bedroom. Jonas passed on some of the memories he received from the Giver to Gabriel so he could sleep well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Jonas returns home the evening after making the escape plan with the Receiver, he learns from his father that Gabriel is to be released the next day because he is still not sleeping through the night whenever he is at the Nurturing Center. Knowing now that releasing means that Gabriel will be killed, Jonas promptly decides to escape with him. It pains him greatly that he can no longer say goodbye to the Receiver he has grown to love as a father.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next night, he rides away on his father\u0027s bicycle with Gabriel in the child\u0027s seat. Over the next few days, the two ride at night and hide during the day to avoid being discovered by search parties. They move far away from the community and encounter animals and experience how the weather changes. They end up in deep snow and have to cross a high mountain.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas already believes that they will freeze or starve to death, but then they come to a place that he knows from his first memory that the Receiver transferred to him. It is the memory of a sled with which he can travel down the mountain.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonas finds the sled and goes down the mountain with Gabriel. He is firmly convinced that there are people down on the mountain who will take them in and help them. As he descends, he hears music from below for the first time in his life, for music has also ceased to exist in his community. The novel has an open ending and it is not told what really waits for Jonas and Gabriel at the foot of the mountain after their heroic escape.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The Giver | Summary","MetaDescription":"Lois Lowry\u0027s dystopian novel The Giver (1993) tells the story of Jonas, a 12-year-old student , who lives with his parents and his sister Lily in a terraced house.
