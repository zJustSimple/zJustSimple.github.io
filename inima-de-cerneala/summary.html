Meggie can no longer remember her mother. Mortimer, whom she calls only "Mo", has told her that her mother went on an adventure nine years ago and has not returned since.</p><p>In the middle of a rainy night, an old acquaintance of Mo's, the juggler "Dustfinger", appears at their door. He warns Mo, whom he calls "Silvertongue", about a villain named Capricorn who wants a certain valuable book from him. Mo, Meggie, and Dustfinger flee together to Meggie's great-aunt Elinor, who lives alone in a large house on an upper Italian lake. Elinor helps hide the mysterious book. One night, Capricorn's men show up, kidnap Mo. and steal the book. However, they don&rsquo;t know that Elinor has secretly switched the book so she can read it. Therefore, they actually take the wrong book.</p><h2 id="heading-7xyjn" data-guid="f0b88084-41c0-498e-add6-35ffb62e9432">In Capricorn's village</h2><p>After Mo disappears, Meggie, Elinor, and Dustfinger decide to give the right book to Capricorn in order to free Mo. They travel together to Capricorn's village. There, it turns out that Dustfinger had told Capricorn about where Mo and the book are, and now he has lured Meggie and Elinor into a trap.</p><p>Capricorn does not want to trade the book for Mo. He now uses Meggie as leverage to get Mo to read books to him, something he has refused to do until now. Mo has a special gift: By reading aloud from books, he can conjure up creatures and objects from the stories. In this process, however, the same number of things or people from the real world disappear into the book.</p><p>Meggie now learns what happened nine years ago when her father read the book <i>Inkheart&nbsp;</i>to her mother. Suddenly her mother and her two cats disappeared and in turn Capricorn, Basta, and Dustfinger landed in this world. Mo was able to drive Capricorn and Basta out of the house. The juggler Dustfinger initially disappeared on his own, but kept showing up at Mo's house because he missed the world of <i>Inkheart</i>.</p><p>Now Capricorn has what he wants. He owns all the editions of <i>Inkheart</i> and keeps Mo, Meggie, and Elinor prisoners in a cage. He organizes a ceremony in the village church the next day, burning all the copies of <i>Inkheart </i>he has collected over the years. Thus the traitor Dustfinger himself is betrayed. Without the book, he can no longer return to the world of <i>Inkheart</i>, despite what Capricorn had promised him.</p><h2 id="heading-eyste" data-guid="ebf2fa1b-6d34-4cfe-8b5f-8919f649e4f6">The escape</h2><p>Capricorn then forces Mo to show his magic ability and has him read out a great many gold coins from the book <i>Treasure Island</i>. From the next book <i>T</i><span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A collection of Oriental stories. They are more commonly known in English as <i>Arabian Nights.</i></p>"><i>he Thousand and One&nbsp;&nbsp;Nights</i>,</span> however, only a boy named Farid emerges. Capricorn wants Mo to conjure up a friend of his from the last remaining copy of <i>Inkheart</i>. He first lets the prisoners rest a bit in their dungeon.</p><p>At night, Dustfinger frees Mo, Meggie, Elinor, and Farid from the cages. They escape from the village in Elinor's car. On the way they have to leave the car and continue their escape on foot. Farid feels very much at home in the new world and from then on is a faithful companion to Dustfinger. At one point, they are discovered by two of Capricorn's men, but they manage to overpower the two and continue their escape.</p><h2 id="heading-tsncp" data-guid="b4c91043-c1b9-4b4c-8e28-b08251bde500">Fenoglio</h2><p>Thanks to Elinor's credit card, which she has hidden in her clothes, they can spend a few relaxing days in a city on the coast. Still, both Dustfinger and Mo wish to get their hands on a copy of <i>Inkheart</i>. Mo is desperate to free his wife, and Dustfinger wants to return to his story. The two therefore set off to Fenoglio, the author of the book, who lives nearby. Unfortunately, Fenoglio doesn't have any copies either, because they were all stolen.</p><p>While Mo and Meggie stay in Fenoglio's village, Dustfinger sets off with Farid to get the book from Capricorn and meets with one of Capricorn's maids named Resa. She is supposed to tell him where Capricorn has hidden the book, but both are discovered and imprisoned. Elinor is not lucky either. When she returns home, she discovers that all her books have been burned. She wants to go to the police, but Mo advises her against it. She should rather come to him. Mo has an idea, which he confides to Fenoglio.</p><p>Capricorn's men track down Meggie and Mo at Fenoglio's home. Since Mo has gone to the airport to pick up Elinor, they can only kidnap Meggie and Fenoglio and take them to Capricorn's village. Meggie discovers that she has the same magical ability as her father, because she manages to conjure up the fairy Tinker Bell from the book <i>Peter Pan</i>. When Capricorn learns of this, he wants to use Meggie as a reader to bring out his old friend, the "Shadow".</p><p>Dustfinger sneaks into the village and persuades the mute maid Resa to help him find the book in the house. In the process, however, Risa is caught by Basta and Mortola, Capricorn's mother. Afterwards, both are locked up in the crypt under the church. There, Meggie visits Dustfinger and discoversthat Resa is her mother. Dustfinger manages to overpower Basta and lock him up. He escapes alone and finds a good hiding place in Basta's abandoned house.</p><p>Fenoglio now wants to try Mo's idea and, thanks to his writing skills, makes Meggie return the tin soldier she previously conjured up from a fairy tale into his story. Now the writer knows that it is possible to make a character from a work appear and disappear again. He will now try to rewrite the story of <i>Inkheart&nbsp;</i>so that the Shadow will turn against Capricorn and kill him.</p><p>Mo and Elinor, meanwhile, make their way to the village to free Meggie and Fenoglio. On the way, they are stopped by Farid and Dustfinger. Farid, Mo, and Dustfinger each sneak around the village on their own.</p><p>Elinor seeks help from the police. One of the policemen takes her to Capricorn and believes his explanations. Elinor is put back in the crypt with her niece.</p><h2 id="heading-9mxgr" data-guid="1571aa7d-4269-481d-9808-76c19707d1e9">The happy ending</h2><p>Capricorn has decided to have Resa, Elinor, and Basta executed by the Shadow. They are locked together in a cage on a pedestal. Capricorn's men and women are all gathered on the soccer field to be there when Meggie conjures up the monster.</p><p>Mo and Farid sneak back into the village and set fire to Capricorn's house. There are two disturbances in the assembly because of this. Capricorn sends several men to put out the fire. One woman believes that Dustfinger started the fire, but Capricorn assures her that he is dead. Meggie loudly claims the opposite.</p><p>Meggie only has to read briefly from <i>Inkheart&nbsp;</i>to make the giant Shadow appear in the square. She then begins to read aloud the new story Fenoglio has written, which she had hidden in the sleeve of her white dress, but can't get the last words past her lips. Suddenly Mo stands behind her and continues reading the passage. The Shadow kills Capricorn. Meggie then finishes reading the note. The Shadow disappears and with it half of Capricorn's men disappear. The others flee.</p><p>When the Shadow crumbles, all the humans, fairies, and goblins who died because of it reappear in exchange. Elinor offers to take them in at her large estate. Meggie discovers that Fenoglio has disappeared and thinks he is now trapped in the world of <i>Inkheart</i>. Basta and Capricorn's mother Mortola have also escaped.</p><p>Dustfinger, who has been watching the whole thing from a distance, shows up and steals the last copy of <i>Inkheart&nbsp;</i>from the sleeping Mo. He still does not give up hope that one day he will be able to return to his story. Farid leaves with him in the middle of the night. They go south.</p><p>Meggie is reunited with her mother and Mo with his wife. Resa was conjured out of <i>Inkheart&nbsp;</i>five years ago by the clumsy reader Darius. However, she lost her voice in the process and now has to write down her memories. Resa tells Meggie that the world of <i>Inkheart</i> is full of horror and beauty.</p><p>Mo, Meggie, Resa, and some of the magical creatures travel with Elinor to her house, where they continue to live happily and peacefully together. Maggie now wants to learn how to write books.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="personaje.html" title="Inima de cerneala | Personaje" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Personaje</span></a></div></div></div></div>

Meggie can no longer remember her mother. Mortimer, whom she calls only \u0022Mo\u0022, has told her that her mother went on an adventure nine years ago and has not returned since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of a rainy night, an old acquaintance of Mo\u0027s, the juggler \u0022Dustfinger\u0022, appears at their door. He warns Mo, whom he calls \u0022Silvertongue\u0022, about a villain named Capricorn who wants a certain valuable book from him. Mo, Meggie, and Dustfinger flee together to Meggie\u0027s great-aunt Elinor, who lives alone in a large house on an upper Italian lake. Elinor helps hide the mysterious book. One night, Capricorn\u0027s men show up, kidnap Mo. and steal the book. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t know that Elinor has secretly switched the book so she can read it. Therefore, they actually take the wrong book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7xyjn\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f0b88084-41c0-498e-add6-35ffb62e9432\u0022\u003eIn Capricorn\u0027s village\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Mo disappears, Meggie, Elinor, and Dustfinger decide to give the right book to Capricorn in order to free Mo. They travel together to Capricorn\u0027s village. There, it turns out that Dustfinger had told Capricorn about where Mo and the book are, and now he has lured Meggie and Elinor into a trap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCapricorn does not want to trade the book for Mo. He now uses Meggie as leverage to get Mo to read books to him, something he has refused to do until now. Mo has a special gift: By reading aloud from books, he can conjure up creatures and objects from the stories. In this process, however, the same number of things or people from the real world disappear into the book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeggie now learns what happened nine years ago when her father read the book \u003ci\u003eInkheart\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eto her mother.

He owns all the editions of \u003ci\u003eInkheart\u003c/i\u003e and keeps Mo, Meggie, and Elinor prisoners in a cage. He organizes a ceremony in the village church the next day, burning all the copies of \u003ci\u003eInkheart \u003c/i\u003ehe has collected over the years. Thus the traitor Dustfinger himself is betrayed. Without the book, he can no longer return to the world of \u003ci\u003eInkheart\u003c/i\u003e, despite what Capricorn had promised him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-eyste\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ebf2fa1b-6d34-4cfe-8b5f-8919f649e4f6\u0022\u003eThe escape\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCapricorn then forces Mo to show his magic ability and has him read out a great many gold coins from the book \u003ci\u003eTreasure Island\u003c/i\u003e.

They escape from the village in Elinor\u0027s car. On the way they have to leave the car and continue their escape on foot. Farid feels very much at home in the new world and from then on is a faithful companion to Dustfinger.

Still, both Dustfinger and Mo wish to get their hands on a copy of \u003ci\u003eInkheart\u003c/i\u003e. Mo is desperate to free his wife, and Dustfinger wants to return to his story. The two therefore set off to Fenoglio, the author of the book, who lives nearby.

She is supposed to tell him where Capricorn has hidden the book, but both are discovered and imprisoned. Elinor is not lucky either. When she returns home, she discovers that all her books have been burned. She wants to go to the police, but Mo advises her against it. She should rather come to him. Mo has an idea, which he confides to Fenoglio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCapricorn\u0027s men track down Meggie and Mo at Fenoglio\u0027s home. Since Mo has gone to the airport to pick up Elinor, they can only kidnap Meggie and Fenoglio and take them to Capricorn\u0027s village. Meggie discovers that she has the same magical ability as her father, because she manages to conjure up the fairy Tinker Bell from the book \u003ci\u003ePeter Pan\u003c/i\u003e. When Capricorn learns of this, he wants to use Meggie as a reader to bring out his old friend, the \u0022Shadow\u0022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDustfinger sneaks into the village and persuades the mute maid Resa to help him find the book in the house. In the process, however, Risa is caught by Basta and Mortola, Capricorn\u0027s mother. Afterwards, both are locked up in the crypt under the church. There, Meggie visits Dustfinger and discoversthat Resa is her mother. Dustfinger manages to overpower Basta and lock him up.
