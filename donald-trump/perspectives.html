This led to the <strong>US being replaced as the top-rated global power</strong> by Germany.</p><p>The <strong>relationship between the US and Mexico suffered</strong> after Trump&rsquo;s negative remarks on illegal Mexican immigrants, and his insistence that Mexico should pay for the US-Mexico border wall. Trump&rsquo;s threats to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as his personal attacks on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also created <strong>tension between the US and Canada</strong>. The Gallup poll also found that Mexico and Canada are more likely to approve of China than of US.</p><p><strong>In Europe, the approval rating dropped considerably</strong>, with only three countries showing a favorable opinion of Trump&rsquo;s US: Kosovo, Albania, and Poland. A majority approval is new for Poland; this has been attributed to a tendency in Poland&rsquo;s government to adopt similar policies to Trump&rsquo;s, and to Poland&rsquo;s interest in building a relationship with Trump in the hopes that the US will establish a permanent military base in Poland.</p><p>The lowest rating in Europe was expressed by Russia, which is not surprising given the historically strained relationship between Russia and the US. However, this relationship seems to improve as Trump has often expressed his interest in building more trust between the two nations. Alongside Russia, Iceland, Portugal, and Sweden give the US the lowest approval rating in Europe, which sits at lower than 13 per cent in each country.</p><p>In the Middle East, Donald <strong>Trump&rsquo;s popularity has considerably increased among Israelis</strong>, most likely because Israel benefits from Trump&rsquo;s support and agenda in its ongoing conflict with Palestinians.</p><h2 data-guid="442dc45c-e98a-4ace-a862-ab711e30ce1f" id="heading-2">Other politicians comparable to Donald Trump</h2><h3>Jair Bolsonaro</h3><p>A far-right politician and former military officer, <strong>Jair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil</strong> at the end of October 2018. Bolsonaro gained worldwide attention in the media for his populist rhetoric, but also for making offensive statements about women and gay people, threatening his opponents with violence and exile, and a critical stance against human rights activists, environmentalists and indigenous people.</p><p>Like Trump, Bolsonaro <strong>has been accused of inciting fear and hatred in his supporters and encouraging violence</strong> against certain groups and individuals.</p><p>However, struggling with a record-high crime rate and unemployment level, distrust in the political establishment following corruption scandals and a deep recession, Brazil preferred Bolsonaro mostly because of <strong>his promise to tackle crime and turn Brazil into a great nation</strong>.</p><p>Similarly to Donald Trump, Bolsonaro relied heavily on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to make his voice heard among the voters and gain new supporters. His supporters also created hundreds of groups on the instant messaging services WhatsApp, and then used them to spread false news that praised Bolsonaro and discredited his opponents.</p><p>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s approval rating also rose after he was stabbed during a campaign rally in September. Some commented that this unfortunate event was seen as proof that Bolsonaro was indeed a threat to the establishment, and therefore, a valuable candidate for presidency.</p><p><strong>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s stance on immigration and Chinese influence is also similar to Donald Trump&rsquo;s</strong>. During his campaign, Bolsonaro talked about changing the country&rsquo;s border policy, and talked about immigration as a national security issue. &nbsp;This appealed to many Brazilians, as they became increasingly worried about the steady influx of Venezuelan migrants fleeing from Venezuela&rsquo;s deep economic crisis.</p><p>Although China has been a major investor in Brazil since 2003, Bolsonaro talked about how the country faces the threat of being bought and taken over by China.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump publicly congratulated Bolsanero after his election victory</strong>, and stated that he would have the full support of the US.</p><h3>Rodrigo Duterte</h3><p><strong>Rodrigo Duterte, the current</strong> <strong>President of the Philippines</strong>, is another leader who has often been described as having nationalist and populist appeal.</p><p>Duterte has often been in the headlines of international news organizations because of his offensive and violent remarks. He is most known for <strong>his war on drugs and crime</strong>, which he proudly compared to the Holocaust, saying that he is ready to slaughter drug users like Hitler did with the Jewish people.</p><p>His discriminatory attitude towards women, his tendency to incite to violence and brag about his often questionable achievements have led many to compare Duterte to Trump. In turn, Trump has once congratulated Duterte for doing a great job on eradicating the drug problem in the Philippines.</p><p>A former lawyer and prosecutor, Duterte was also mayor of Davao City for more than 22 years. He gained support in his political career for his anti-drug stance but also, more importantly, for his involvement in extrajudicial killings &ndash; the killing of offenders by government authorities, without a prior legal process. Duterte has also repeatedly admitted to <strong>personally killing people</strong> while mayor.</p><p>Duterte&rsquo;s violent and long-standing war on drugs has attracted the attention of <strong>human rights organizations</strong>, which began to keep watch on the development of his criminal actions. One year into his presidency, reports show that thousands of Filipinos were killed for petty crimes and involvement with drugs, but also that Duterte&rsquo;s campaign has not solved the crime problem in the Philippines. Nonetheless, Duterte remained popular, as many of his supporters declared themselves confident that the president is dealing with the country&rsquo;s drug and crime problem efficiently.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump has frequently expressed admiration for Duterte and his aggressive policy in the war on drugs</strong>, leading to heavy criticism from Trump&rsquo;s political opponents, who have pointed to Duterte&rsquo;s terrible human rights record.</p><h2 data-guid="46433bb7-7f96-4257-b387-768d1c855ca9" id="heading-3">Global trend towards nationalism</h2><p>In recent years, political analysts have noticed that <strong>nationalism is globally on the rise</strong>. This can be seen in some&nbsp;European countries, for example, where far-right and nationalist parties have been elected into office, or have become strong opposition voices to current governments. Although the political landscape is different in each country, certain common tendencies have stood out, such as anti-immigration and anti-Islamic rhetoric and policies, a tendency towards less globalization, and rising criticism of European integration and the European Union.</p><p>In Germany, for example, the far-right, anti-euro <strong>Alternative for Deutschland (AfD)</strong>&nbsp;party recently became the largest opposition party. Its rise in popularity was attributed to the people&rsquo;s discontent with Germany&rsquo;s open-door policy for refugees, as the party has a strong anti-immigrant stance, pushing for policies especially aimed against Islamic immigrants.</p><p>In the UK, the <strong>Brexit-referendum</strong> was also heavily influenced by anti-globalist and anti-immigrant messages, which seemed to resonate with many British people.</p><p>Anti-immigration parties also gained popularity in countries such as Sweden and Austria, where the migrant crisis is also seen as a cause of serious concern.</p><p>In Italy, a country still affected by the 2008 financial crisis and a destination for many immigrants and refugees, a coalition government was formed by two populist, right-wing parties. The coalition planned for strong anti-immigration policies, as well as for the deportation of illegal immigrants.</p><p>Countries such as Poland, Hungary, and Slovenia have also criticized the European Union&rsquo;s approach to the migrant crisis, and opposed accepting migrants on their territories. Moreover, <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>, Hungary&rsquo;s Prime Minister has also made racist comments on the topic, controversially warning against Europe becoming a mixed-race population, and losing its identity.</p><p>However, <strong>some European nations have also moved in a less nationalist direction</strong>. In France, the far-right nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen was defeated by the centrist, globalization-oriented Emmanuel Macron, for example. Even so, Macron has faced many early challenges and protests during&nbsp;his Presidency, suggesting that he has not been able to fully address the concerns of the working class.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - Theresa May's Lancaster House Speech on Brexit</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>The British Prime Minster Theresa May outlines her initial visions for Britain leaving the EU.

This led to the \u003cstrong\u003eUS being replaced as the top-rated global power\u003c/strong\u003e by Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003erelationship between the US and Mexico suffered\u003c/strong\u003e after Trump\u0026rsquo;s negative remarks on illegal Mexican immigrants, and his insistence that Mexico should pay for the US-Mexico border wall. Trump\u0026rsquo;s threats to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as his personal attacks on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also created \u003cstrong\u003etension between the US and Canada\u003c/strong\u003e. The Gallup poll also found that Mexico and Canada are more likely to approve of China than of US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Europe, the approval rating dropped considerably\u003c/strong\u003e, with only three countries showing a favorable opinion of Trump\u0026rsquo;s US: Kosovo, Albania, and Poland. A majority approval is new for Poland; this has been attributed to a tendency in Poland\u0026rsquo;s government to adopt similar policies to Trump\u0026rsquo;s, and to Poland\u0026rsquo;s interest in building a relationship with Trump in the hopes that the US will establish a permanent military base in Poland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lowest rating in Europe was expressed by Russia, which is not surprising given the historically strained relationship between Russia and the US. However, this relationship seems to improve as Trump has often expressed his interest in building more trust between the two nations. Alongside Russia, Iceland, Portugal, and Sweden give the US the lowest approval rating in Europe, which sits at lower than 13 per cent in each country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the Middle East, Donald \u003cstrong\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s popularity has considerably increased among Israelis\u003c/strong\u003e, most likely because Israel benefits from Trump\u0026rsquo;s support and agenda in its ongoing conflict with Palestinians.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022442dc45c-e98a-4ace-a862-ab711e30ce1f\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003eOther politicians comparable to Donald Trump\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eJair Bolsonaro\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA far-right politician and former military officer, \u003cstrong\u003eJair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil\u003c/strong\u003e at the end of October 2018. Bolsonaro gained worldwide attention in the media for his populist rhetoric, but also for making offensive statements about women and gay people, threatening his opponents with violence and exile, and a critical stance against human rights activists, environmentalists and indigenous people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike Trump, Bolsonaro \u003cstrong\u003ehas been accused of inciting fear and hatred in his supporters and encouraging violence\u003c/strong\u003e against certain groups and individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, struggling with a record-high crime rate and unemployment level, distrust in the political establishment following corruption scandals and a deep recession, Brazil preferred Bolsonaro mostly because of \u003cstrong\u003ehis promise to tackle crime and turn Brazil into a great nation\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly to Donald Trump, Bolsonaro relied heavily on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to make his voice heard among the voters and gain new supporters. His supporters also created hundreds of groups on the instant messaging services WhatsApp, and then used them to spread false news that praised Bolsonaro and discredited his opponents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBolsonaro\u0026rsquo;s approval rating also rose after he was stabbed during a campaign rally in September. Some commented that this unfortunate event was seen as proof that Bolsonaro was indeed a threat to the establishment, and therefore, a valuable candidate for presidency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBolsonaro\u0026rsquo;s stance on immigration and Chinese influence is also similar to Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/strong\u003e. During his campaign, Bolsonaro talked about changing the country\u0026rsquo;s border policy, and talked about immigration as a national security issue. \u0026nbsp;This appealed to many Brazilians, as they became increasingly worried about the steady influx of Venezuelan migrants fleeing from Venezuela\u0026rsquo;s deep economic crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough China has been a major investor in Brazil since 2003, Bolsonaro talked about how the country faces the threat of being bought and taken over by China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump publicly congratulated Bolsanero after his election victory\u003c/strong\u003e, and stated that he would have the full support of the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRodrigo Duterte\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRodrigo Duterte, the current\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ePresident of the Philippines\u003c/strong\u003e, is another leader who has often been described as having nationalist and populist appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuterte has often been in the headlines of international news organizations because of his offensive and violent remarks. He is most known for \u003cstrong\u003ehis war on drugs and crime\u003c/strong\u003e, which he proudly compared to the Holocaust, saying that he is ready to slaughter drug users like Hitler did with the Jewish people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis discriminatory attitude towards women, his tendency to incite to violence and brag about his often questionable achievements have led many to compare Duterte to Trump. In turn, Trump has once congratulated Duterte for doing a great job on eradicating the drug problem in the Philippines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA former lawyer and prosecutor, Duterte was also mayor of Davao City for more than 22 years. He gained support in his political career for his anti-drug stance but also, more importantly, for his involvement in extrajudicial killings \u0026ndash; the killing of offenders by government authorities, without a prior legal process. Duterte has also repeatedly admitted to \u003cstrong\u003epersonally killing people\u003c/strong\u003e while mayor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuterte\u0026rsquo;s violent and long-standing war on drugs has attracted the attention of \u003cstrong\u003ehuman rights organizations\u003c/strong\u003e, which began to keep watch on the development of his criminal actions. One year into his presidency, reports show that thousands of Filipinos were killed for petty crimes and involvement with drugs, but also that Duterte\u0026rsquo;s campaign has not solved the crime problem in the Philippines. Nonetheless, Duterte remained popular, as many of his supporters declared themselves confident that the president is dealing with the country\u0026rsquo;s drug and crime problem efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump has frequently expressed admiration for Duterte and his aggressive policy in the war on drugs\u003c/strong\u003e, leading to heavy criticism from Trump\u0026rsquo;s political opponents, who have pointed to Duterte\u0026rsquo;s terrible human rights record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002246433bb7-7f96-4257-b387-768d1c855ca9\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eGlobal trend towards nationalism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, political analysts have noticed that \u003cstrong\u003enationalism is globally on the rise\u003c/strong\u003e. This can be seen in some\u0026nbsp;European countries, for example, where far-right and nationalist parties have been elected into office, or have become strong opposition voices to current governments. Although the political landscape is different in each country, certain common tendencies have stood out, such as anti-immigration and anti-Islamic rhetoric and policies, a tendency towards less globalization, and rising criticism of European integration and the European Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Germany, for example, the far-right, anti-euro \u003cstrong\u003eAlternative for Deutschland (AfD)\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;party recently became the largest opposition party. Its rise in popularity was attributed to the people\u0026rsquo;s discontent with Germany\u0026rsquo;s open-door policy for refugees, as the party has a strong anti-immigrant stance, pushing for policies especially aimed against Islamic immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the UK, the \u003cstrong\u003eBrexit-referendum\u003c/strong\u003e was also heavily influenced by anti-globalist and anti-immigrant messages, which seemed to resonate with many British people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnti-immigration parties also gained popularity in countries such as Sweden and Austria, where the migrant crisis is also seen as a cause of serious concern.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Italy, a country still affected by the 2008 financial crisis and a destination for many immigrants and refugees, a coalition government was formed by two populist, right-wing parties. The coalition planned for strong anti-immigration policies, as well as for the deportation of illegal immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCountries such as Poland, Hungary, and Slovenia have also criticized the European Union\u0026rsquo;s approach to the migrant crisis, and opposed accepting migrants on their territories. Moreover, \u003cstrong\u003eViktor Orbán\u003c/strong\u003e, Hungary\u0026rsquo;s Prime Minister has also made racist comments on the topic, controversially warning against Europe becoming a mixed-race population, and losing its identity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, \u003cstrong\u003esome European nations have also moved in a less nationalist direction\u003c/strong\u003e. In France, the far-right nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen was defeated by the centrist, globalization-oriented Emmanuel Macron, for example. Even so, Macron has faced many early challenges and protests during\u0026nbsp;his Presidency, suggesting that he has not been able to fully address the concerns of the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - Theresa May\u0027s Lancaster House Speech on Brexit\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eThe British Prime Minster Theresa May outlines her initial visions for Britain leaving the EU.
