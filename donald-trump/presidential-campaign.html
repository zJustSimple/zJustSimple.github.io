The announcement took place at his residence and business headquarters, the Trump Tower in New York.</p><p>Donald Trump introduced his <strong>campaign slogan &ndash; &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; and talked about the issues he would tackle as president, simultaneously defining his stance on these issues. He declared himself against undocumented immigration, free trade, federal debt, terrorism, &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo;, and the fake-news media. Moreover, he made a pledge to build a &ldquo;great wall&rdquo; on the southern border with Mexico, which would stop illegal immigrants.</p><p>He sparked controversy from the beginning by <strong>associating Mexican immigrants with criminals</strong>, saying that Mexico sends murderers and rapists across the border to the US.</p><p>By 2015, Trump had been a favorite in conservative circles for a few years. This was partly due to the fact that he was a <strong>promoter of the &ldquo;birther&rdquo; theory against then-President Barack Obama</strong>. This conspiracy theory challenged Obama&rsquo;s legitimacy as a president, stating that he was not born in the US, but in Africa. According to the Constitution, Obama could not be President in the US if he was born in another country.</p><p>Trump demanded that Obama release his original certificate to prove his birth place, and when Obama did so, Trump questioned its authenticity. He gave up on supporting the claim that Obama was born in Africa only weeks before the 2016 election, when the polls showed him behind other candidates, and blamed his opponent Hillary Clinton for starting the birther rumors.</p><p>Despite being a conservative favorite, <strong>few people took Trump&rsquo;s candidacy seriously </strong>at first. He was criticized and ridiculed by opponents, political commentators, the media, and even by some members of the Republican Party. Those who did not believe that Trump was an appropriate candidate highlighted his <strong>lack of experience in politics, his lack of knowledge on state affairs</strong> - emphasized by his confusing way of speaking, - as well as his <strong>aggressive, &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo; and sexist rhetoric</strong>. You can read more about his rhetoric here.</p><p>Donald Trump, however, managed to turn these flaws into assets. During his campaign he spoke extensively about <strong>his skills as a businessman</strong>, and suggested that most career politicians are corrupt. He used the phrase &ldquo;draining the swamp&rdquo; to symbolize his plans to fix problems in the federal government, and promised to run the country with the successful approach he used in business.</p><p>Many critics raised concerns that Trump&rsquo;s business interests and his international debt would lead to <strong>conflict of interests</strong> with his presidential actions, and possibly violate the Constitution&rsquo;s clause against receiving foreign payments. Trump therefore announced, after the election, that his sons Eric and Donald Jr would run his businesses, although many claimed this would not be enough. This was not seen as a problem by the majority of his <strong>conservative voters, who trusted his anti-establishment stance</strong>, as it generally reflected their own mistrust in the system.</p><p>At first, many thought that Donald Trump did not stand a chance as a candidate because of his <strong>aggressive rhetoric, which angered several groups of people</strong> &ndash; for example, Latinos, African Americans, immigrants, women, and young liberals. Moreover, he attracted the positive attention of <strong>the alt-right</strong> &ndash; the white nationalists&rsquo; movement, including the KKK, which was seen as a clear sign that he would be a divisive President.</p><p>It was predicted that his voters would be conservatives and groups such as white men without a degree who were impressed with the stereotypically masculine image Trump projected. While this was proved true, Trump&rsquo;s promise to create more jobs, to cut taxes, fight crime and keep away undocumented immigrants, also <strong>appealed greatly to those who suffered from the financial crisis </strong>and the subsequent failed efforts to stabilize the economy during the Obama era.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective 1 - Donald Trump's Presidential Announcement Speech</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>Trump used this 2015 speech to formally declare his intention to run for President.

In July 2016, Donald Trump drew heavy criticism by engaging in a <strong>conflict with the Khans</strong>, a Muslim couple whose son, a US soldier, was killed in Iraq in 2004. After Mr and Mrs Khan denounced Trump during a speech at the Democratic Convention, Trump remarked that Mrs Khan remained silent during her husband&rsquo;s speech because her Muslim religion did not allow her to speak. Trump refused to apologize for his statement, even when met with criticism and anger from fellow Republicans, who were outraged that Trump would show such disrespect to the parents of a war hero who had given his life for the US.</p><p>In October 2016, <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;obtained a copy of Trump&rsquo;s 1995 tax returns showing that Trump had <strong>potentially failed to pay taxes for 18 years</strong>. Although commentators also pointed out that his business was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump gained some of the voters&rsquo; admiration by bragging that his debt makes him a smart businessman because it helped him avoid taxes. He was also the first president since Richard Nixon to <strong>refuse to release his tax returns</strong>, virtually making it impossible for the public to verify his claim.</p><p>Another notable moment from October 2016 was the emergence of a 2005 recording of Trump talking about his attempts to have sex with women, using <strong>disrespectful and objectifying terms. He even bragged about his ability to grope woman he had just met because of his status as a celebrity.</strong>. Trump apologized for his remarks, but at the same time defended himself, saying the recording was a private discussion between men. He used the term &ldquo;locker-room&rdquo; talk to imply that this kind of conversation goes on between men all the time and to downplay how bad it was &ndash; which led to further outrage and criticism from both men and women across the political spectrum. Trump also tried to divert the attention from himself by claiming that Hillary and Bill Clinton have done much worse things. &nbsp;</p><p>The media has repeatedly highlighted the controversial remarks Trump has made about African Americans, Jewish people, disabled people and women over the years, simultaneously expressing their disbelief that Trump could be considered a viable candidate for presidency. However, despite these scandals, Trump&rsquo;s popularity was not reduced.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - "Trump is a Climax of American Masculinity" by James Hamblin</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>In this opinion article, James Hamblin speculates that part of the reason for Trump's popularity and ability to survive scandals is the traditional masculine ideals he tries to embody, which resonate well with certain groups within the US.</p></div></div><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="e03a0343-1189-4882-8cc5-5932586902dc">The 2016 election</h2><p>On 8<sup>th</sup> of November, <strong>Donald Trump was elected the 45<sup>th</sup> President of the United States</strong>. Exit polls showed some surprising results, revealing Trump&rsquo;s supporters to be more varied than originally thought. For example, despite his sexist attitude and objectifying comments about women, Donald Trump was also voted for by 52 percent of white women, with support from women both with and without a degree and with various incomes. The African-American vote went largely to his Democratic opponent, with 80 percent of black men and 93 percent of black women voting for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Several traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania voted Republican and helped Donald Trump take the lead in the election, and win in the Electoral College with 306 votes. However, note that&nbsp;Clinton won the popular vote, receiving almost 3 million votes more than Trump.</p><p>This is possible because of the way the American election system works. When a candidate wins a state, they win <em>all </em>of the votes from that state. It does not matter if they win with 51% of state votes or 78% of state votes, the result is the same. So even though Clinton won some states with great majorities, she did not secure the required number of states.</p><p>The outcome of the election was <strong>surprising</strong> to most political analysts, as Hillary Clinton had been the expected winner in the weeks leading up to the election. There are various theories to explain why she ultimately failed to secure the election. Some have argued that the release of a negative report about Hillary from the FBI in the weeks leading up to the election was to blame, others have suggested that the previous scandals of the Clinton family (such as Bill Clinton&rsquo;s affair with Monica Lewinsky) played a part. The very aggressive smear campaign against Hillary led by the Trump campaign and the right-wing press, which often employed sexist strategies and rhetoric, has also been blamed.</p><p>Some have also pointed to the <strong>internal divisions within the Democratic Party</strong>, where supporters of the left-wing Bernie Sanders were often strongly critical of Hillary, and thus might have refused to vote&nbsp;in the presidential election (despite Sanders himself encouraging them to vote for her).</p><p>The truth is probably a combination of these factors.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - Donald Trump's 2016 Victory Speech</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>Trump made this speech on the night of the 2016 presidential election, once it had become clear that he was the winner.

The announcement took place at his residence and business headquarters, the Trump Tower in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump introduced his \u003cstrong\u003ecampaign slogan \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Make America Great Again\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; and talked about the issues he would tackle as president, simultaneously defining his stance on these issues. He declared himself against undocumented immigration, free trade, federal debt, terrorism, \u0026ldquo;political correctness\u0026rdquo;, and the fake-news media. Moreover, he made a pledge to build a \u0026ldquo;great wall\u0026rdquo; on the southern border with Mexico, which would stop illegal immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe sparked controversy from the beginning by \u003cstrong\u003eassociating Mexican immigrants with criminals\u003c/strong\u003e, saying that Mexico sends murderers and rapists across the border to the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 2015, Trump had been a favorite in conservative circles for a few years. This was partly due to the fact that he was a \u003cstrong\u003epromoter of the \u0026ldquo;birther\u0026rdquo; theory against then-President Barack Obama\u003c/strong\u003e. This conspiracy theory challenged Obama\u0026rsquo;s legitimacy as a president, stating that he was not born in the US, but in Africa. According to the Constitution, Obama could not be President in the US if he was born in another country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump demanded that Obama release his original certificate to prove his birth place, and when Obama did so, Trump questioned its authenticity. He gave up on supporting the claim that Obama was born in Africa only weeks before the 2016 election, when the polls showed him behind other candidates, and blamed his opponent Hillary Clinton for starting the birther rumors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite being a conservative favorite, \u003cstrong\u003efew people took Trump\u0026rsquo;s candidacy seriously \u003c/strong\u003eat first. He was criticized and ridiculed by opponents, political commentators, the media, and even by some members of the Republican Party. Those who did not believe that Trump was an appropriate candidate highlighted his \u003cstrong\u003elack of experience in politics, his lack of knowledge on state affairs\u003c/strong\u003e - emphasized by his confusing way of speaking, - as well as his \u003cstrong\u003eaggressive, \u0026ldquo;politically incorrect\u0026rdquo; and sexist rhetoric\u003c/strong\u003e. You can read more about his rhetoric here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump, however, managed to turn these flaws into assets. During his campaign he spoke extensively about \u003cstrong\u003ehis skills as a businessman\u003c/strong\u003e, and suggested that most career politicians are corrupt. He used the phrase \u0026ldquo;draining the swamp\u0026rdquo; to symbolize his plans to fix problems in the federal government, and promised to run the country with the successful approach he used in business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany critics raised concerns that Trump\u0026rsquo;s business interests and his international debt would lead to \u003cstrong\u003econflict of interests\u003c/strong\u003e with his presidential actions, and possibly violate the Constitution\u0026rsquo;s clause against receiving foreign payments. Trump therefore announced, after the election, that his sons Eric and Donald Jr would run his businesses, although many claimed this would not be enough. This was not seen as a problem by the majority of his \u003cstrong\u003econservative voters, who trusted his anti-establishment stance\u003c/strong\u003e, as it generally reflected their own mistrust in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first, many thought that Donald Trump did not stand a chance as a candidate because of his \u003cstrong\u003eaggressive rhetoric, which angered several groups of people\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; for example, Latinos, African Americans, immigrants, women, and young liberals. Moreover, he attracted the positive attention of \u003cstrong\u003ethe alt-right\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; the white nationalists\u0026rsquo; movement, including the KKK, which was seen as a clear sign that he would be a divisive President.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was predicted that his voters would be conservatives and groups such as white men without a degree who were impressed with the stereotypically masculine image Trump projected. While this was proved true, Trump\u0026rsquo;s promise to create more jobs, to cut taxes, fight crime and keep away undocumented immigrants, also \u003cstrong\u003eappealed greatly to those who suffered from the financial crisis \u003c/strong\u003eand the subsequent failed efforts to stabilize the economy during the Obama era.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective 1 - Donald Trump\u0027s Presidential Announcement Speech\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump used this 2015 speech to formally declare his intention to run for President.

In July 2016, Donald Trump drew heavy criticism by engaging in a \u003cstrong\u003econflict with the Khans\u003c/strong\u003e, a Muslim couple whose son, a US soldier, was killed in Iraq in 2004. After Mr and Mrs Khan denounced Trump during a speech at the Democratic Convention, Trump remarked that Mrs Khan remained silent during her husband\u0026rsquo;s speech because her Muslim religion did not allow her to speak. Trump refused to apologize for his statement, even when met with criticism and anger from fellow Republicans, who were outraged that Trump would show such disrespect to the parents of a war hero who had given his life for the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn October 2016, \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;obtained a copy of Trump\u0026rsquo;s 1995 tax returns showing that Trump had \u003cstrong\u003epotentially failed to pay taxes for 18 years\u003c/strong\u003e. Although commentators also pointed out that his business was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump gained some of the voters\u0026rsquo; admiration by bragging that his debt makes him a smart businessman because it helped him avoid taxes. He was also the first president since Richard Nixon to \u003cstrong\u003erefuse to release his tax returns\u003c/strong\u003e, virtually making it impossible for the public to verify his claim.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother notable moment from October 2016 was the emergence of a 2005 recording of Trump talking about his attempts to have sex with women, using \u003cstrong\u003edisrespectful and objectifying terms. He even bragged about his ability to grope woman he had just met because of his status as a celebrity.\u003c/strong\u003e. Trump apologized for his remarks, but at the same time defended himself, saying the recording was a private discussion between men. He used the term \u0026ldquo;locker-room\u0026rdquo; talk to imply that this kind of conversation goes on between men all the time and to downplay how bad it was \u0026ndash; which led to further outrage and criticism from both men and women across the political spectrum. Trump also tried to divert the attention from himself by claiming that Hillary and Bill Clinton have done much worse things. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe media has repeatedly highlighted the controversial remarks Trump has made about African Americans, Jewish people, disabled people and women over the years, simultaneously expressing their disbelief that Trump could be considered a viable candidate for presidency. However, despite these scandals, Trump\u0026rsquo;s popularity was not reduced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - \u0022Trump is a Climax of American Masculinity\u0022 by James Hamblin\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this opinion article, James Hamblin speculates that part of the reason for Trump\u0027s popularity and ability to survive scandals is the traditional masculine ideals he tries to embody, which resonate well with certain groups within the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e03a0343-1189-4882-8cc5-5932586902dc\u0022\u003eThe 2016 election\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of November, \u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump was elected the 45\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e President of the United States\u003c/strong\u003e. Exit polls showed some surprising results, revealing Trump\u0026rsquo;s supporters to be more varied than originally thought. For example, despite his sexist attitude and objectifying comments about women, Donald Trump was also voted for by 52 percent of white women, with support from women both with and without a degree and with various incomes. The African-American vote went largely to his Democratic opponent, with 80 percent of black men and 93 percent of black women voting for Hillary Clinton.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania voted Republican and helped Donald Trump take the lead in the election, and win in the Electoral College with 306 votes. However, note that\u0026nbsp;Clinton won the popular vote, receiving almost 3 million votes more than Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is possible because of the way the American election system works. When a candidate wins a state, they win \u003cem\u003eall \u003c/em\u003eof the votes from that state. It does not matter if they win with 51% of state votes or 78% of state votes, the result is the same. So even though Clinton won some states with great majorities, she did not secure the required number of states.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe outcome of the election was \u003cstrong\u003esurprising\u003c/strong\u003e to most political analysts, as Hillary Clinton had been the expected winner in the weeks leading up to the election. There are various theories to explain why she ultimately failed to secure the election. Some have argued that the release of a negative report about Hillary from the FBI in the weeks leading up to the election was to blame, others have suggested that the previous scandals of the Clinton family (such as Bill Clinton\u0026rsquo;s affair with Monica Lewinsky) played a part. The very aggressive smear campaign against Hillary led by the Trump campaign and the right-wing press, which often employed sexist strategies and rhetoric, has also been blamed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome have also pointed to the \u003cstrong\u003einternal divisions within the Democratic Party\u003c/strong\u003e, where supporters of the left-wing Bernie Sanders were often strongly critical of Hillary, and thus might have refused to vote\u0026nbsp;in the presidential election (despite Sanders himself encouraging them to vote for her).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe truth is probably a combination of these factors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - Donald Trump\u0027s 2016 Victory Speech\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump made this speech on the night of the 2016 presidential election, once it had become clear that he was the winner.
