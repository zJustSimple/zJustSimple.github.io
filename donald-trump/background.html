In their youth, the three brothers of the Trump family &ndash; Donald, Fred Jr. and Robert &ndash; worked in their father&rsquo;s offices and on construction sites. Their sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, were not brought into the business, as Fred Trump supposedly believed that real estate was a man&rsquo;s business.</p><p>While Robert became an executive in his father&rsquo;s business, Fred Jr. did not get along with their father. He left to become an airline pilot and died in 1981 from alcoholism. Donald Trump has stated that Fred&rsquo;s alcoholism and death motivated him to <strong>avoid drinking and smoking</strong>.</p><p>Donald Trump attended the New York Military Academy from the age of 13.&nbsp; He graduated in 1960 from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School&rsquo;s real estate program and returned to work for the family business in New York. By this time, he had already invested in Philadelphia real estate. <strong>He avoided being drafted into the Vietnam War</strong> with a number of postponements due to college and medical issues.</p><p>Donald Trump married Ivana Zelnickova in 1977, and had three children: Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric. Trump later became involved in a personal scandal after an affair with actress Marla Maples. In 1993, the two had a daughter together, Tiffany. Trump and Maples were married from 1993 until 1999. In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model <strong>Melania Knauss</strong>, who also became a US citizen that year. Their son Barron was born in 2006.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="c8899f6c-ae8d-495d-a52e-b73fdf337183">Professional life</h2><p>By the mid-1970s, Donald Trump had taken control of his father&rsquo;s company, renaming it <strong>the Trump Organization</strong>. He extended the business to Manhattan, investing in skyscrapers. In 1975, the company settled a trial in which it was accused of refusing to rent apartments to African Americans. The company was legally forced to advertise that their apartments were available for all, but never admitted to having been guilty of discrimination in the first place. &nbsp;</p><p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s first big project in Manhattan was the development of the <strong>Grand Hyatt Hotel</strong> from the ruin of another former hotel. The purchase of the former hotel was facilitated by a partnership with the Hyatt hotel chain, and an important tax break for the property. However, it has been reported that Trump also used his father&rsquo;s political influence to facilitate the complex transaction. Later, Trump was criticized for building his business with taxpayers&rsquo; money, and with help from his political connections.</p><p>The Trump business continued to develop with Trump Plaza, an apartment building, and the <strong>Trump Tower</strong>,&nbsp; which also held Donald Trump&rsquo;s residence and his company&rsquo;s headquarters. In the 1980s, Trump opened several casinos in Atlantic City and, in 1990s, the Trump Taj Mahal.</p><p>However, the Trump Taj Mahal was built as a result of Trump going into significant debt. It became a bad investment, and Trump had to sell his yacht and his airline.</p><p>The 1990s saw Donald Trump <strong>struggling to keep his business afloat</strong>, borrowing more money in the process. By 2004, his company went bankrupt and Trump was sued by several banks for failure to pay his debts. From 2009 until 2015, Trump tried to keep his casinos in business but he ultimately failed and his casinos were closed. However, because they were under a publicly traded company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, Trump was able to avoid being held personally accountable for his debts, thus managing to keep most of his fortune.</p><p>Donald Trump has managed to <strong>keep his name associated with wealth and success despite financial struggles and legal issues</strong>. He was helped largely by the entertainment business, as he often appeared in the media as the owner of beauty pageants such as Miss USA, Miss Teen USA, and Miss Universe. He also made guest appearances in several TV shows and movies throughout the 1990s. However, Trump became a widely known celebrity with the help of NBC shows <strong>&ldquo;The Apprentice&rdquo;</strong> (2004-2015) and <strong>&ldquo;Celebrity Apprentice&rdquo;</strong> (2008-2015), where both regular people and celebrities competed in business-related challenges meant to raise money and impress Donald Trump.</p><p>NBC ended its professional relationship with Trump after he made <strong>anti-immigrant remarks</strong> at the beginning of his presidential campaign.</p><p>From 1987 to 2015, Trump also published at least <strong>12 books</strong> on several topics such as self-help and personal finance. Most of the books, however, were written by ghostwriters (a person hired to write texts which are then credited to another person as the author) and with the help of co-authors.</p><p>By the time he announced his candidacy, the Trump Organization was also involved with US and international golf resorts, but was <strong>heavily in debt</strong>. The organisation had also been involved in thousands of lawsuits over time, and it settled some of these lawsuits after Trump&rsquo;s election. For example, it paid a multi-million dollar settlement to solve cases of consumer fraud by Trump University, a 2005 organisation which promised to teach Trump&rsquo;s secrets for success.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="5aa0142f-c10b-4859-807a-bed382f2ba24">Early involvement in politics</h2><p>Trump&rsquo;s early interest and involvement in politics was brought on by his own father&rsquo;s involvement with the Brooklyn&rsquo;s Democratic organization and the political and business relationships which developed from that.</p><p>Trump, however, <strong>has frequently switched political alliances</strong>. By 1987, he identified as Republican; in the following years, he would associate himself with Democrats, with the Reform Party, and identify as independent.</p><p>Trump first talked about running for president in 1987, when he also opposed President Reagan&rsquo;s foreign policy on offering foreign aid to countries such as Japan. From 1988 onwards, Trump generally identified as Republican or backed Republican candidates, with the exception of the George W. Bush administration period, during which he often took a stance as a Democrat against Bush&rsquo;s policies.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../donald-trump.html" title="Donald Trump" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Donald Trump</span></a><a href="presidential-campaign.html" title="Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

In their youth, the three brothers of the Trump family \u0026ndash; Donald, Fred Jr. and Robert \u0026ndash; worked in their father\u0026rsquo;s offices and on construction sites. Their sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, were not brought into the business, as Fred Trump supposedly believed that real estate was a man\u0026rsquo;s business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Robert became an executive in his father\u0026rsquo;s business, Fred Jr. did not get along with their father. He left to become an airline pilot and died in 1981 from alcoholism. Donald Trump has stated that Fred\u0026rsquo;s alcoholism and death motivated him to \u003cstrong\u003eavoid drinking and smoking\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump attended the New York Military Academy from the age of 13.\u0026nbsp; He graduated in 1960 from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School\u0026rsquo;s real estate program and returned to work for the family business in New York. By this time, he had already invested in Philadelphia real estate. \u003cstrong\u003eHe avoided being drafted into the Vietnam War\u003c/strong\u003e with a number of postponements due to college and medical issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump married Ivana Zelnickova in 1977, and had three children: Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric. Trump later became involved in a personal scandal after an affair with actress Marla Maples. In 1993, the two had a daughter together, Tiffany. Trump and Maples were married from 1993 until 1999. In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model \u003cstrong\u003eMelania Knauss\u003c/strong\u003e, who also became a US citizen that year. Their son Barron was born in 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c8899f6c-ae8d-495d-a52e-b73fdf337183\u0022\u003eProfessional life\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the mid-1970s, Donald Trump had taken control of his father\u0026rsquo;s company, renaming it \u003cstrong\u003ethe Trump Organization\u003c/strong\u003e. He extended the business to Manhattan, investing in skyscrapers. In 1975, the company settled a trial in which it was accused of refusing to rent apartments to African Americans. The company was legally forced to advertise that their apartments were available for all, but never admitted to having been guilty of discrimination in the first place. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump\u0026rsquo;s first big project in Manhattan was the development of the \u003cstrong\u003eGrand Hyatt Hotel\u003c/strong\u003e from the ruin of another former hotel. The purchase of the former hotel was facilitated by a partnership with the Hyatt hotel chain, and an important tax break for the property. However, it has been reported that Trump also used his father\u0026rsquo;s political influence to facilitate the complex transaction. Later, Trump was criticized for building his business with taxpayers\u0026rsquo; money, and with help from his political connections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Trump business continued to develop with Trump Plaza, an apartment building, and the \u003cstrong\u003eTrump Tower\u003c/strong\u003e,\u0026nbsp; which also held Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s residence and his company\u0026rsquo;s headquarters. In the 1980s, Trump opened several casinos in Atlantic City and, in 1990s, the Trump Taj Mahal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Trump Taj Mahal was built as a result of Trump going into significant debt. It became a bad investment, and Trump had to sell his yacht and his airline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 1990s saw Donald Trump \u003cstrong\u003estruggling to keep his business afloat\u003c/strong\u003e, borrowing more money in the process. By 2004, his company went bankrupt and Trump was sued by several banks for failure to pay his debts. From 2009 until 2015, Trump tried to keep his casinos in business but he ultimately failed and his casinos were closed. However, because they were under a publicly traded company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, Trump was able to avoid being held personally accountable for his debts, thus managing to keep most of his fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump has managed to \u003cstrong\u003ekeep his name associated with wealth and success despite financial struggles and legal issues\u003c/strong\u003e. He was helped largely by the entertainment business, as he often appeared in the media as the owner of beauty pageants such as Miss USA, Miss Teen USA, and Miss Universe. He also made guest appearances in several TV shows and movies throughout the 1990s. However, Trump became a widely known celebrity with the help of NBC shows \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Apprentice\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e (2004-2015) and \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;Celebrity Apprentice\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e (2008-2015), where both regular people and celebrities competed in business-related challenges meant to raise money and impress Donald Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNBC ended its professional relationship with Trump after he made \u003cstrong\u003eanti-immigrant remarks\u003c/strong\u003e at the beginning of his presidential campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom 1987 to 2015, Trump also published at least \u003cstrong\u003e12 books\u003c/strong\u003e on several topics such as self-help and personal finance. Most of the books, however, were written by ghostwriters (a person hired to write texts which are then credited to another person as the author) and with the help of co-authors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time he announced his candidacy, the Trump Organization was also involved with US and international golf resorts, but was \u003cstrong\u003eheavily in debt\u003c/strong\u003e. The organisation had also been involved in thousands of lawsuits over time, and it settled some of these lawsuits after Trump\u0026rsquo;s election. For example, it paid a multi-million dollar settlement to solve cases of consumer fraud by Trump University, a 2005 organisation which promised to teach Trump\u0026rsquo;s secrets for success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00225aa0142f-c10b-4859-807a-bed382f2ba24\u0022\u003eEarly involvement in politics\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s early interest and involvement in politics was brought on by his own father\u0026rsquo;s involvement with the Brooklyn\u0026rsquo;s Democratic organization and the political and business relationships which developed from that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump, however, \u003cstrong\u003ehas frequently switched political alliances\u003c/strong\u003e. By 1987, he identified as Republican; in the following years, he would associate himself with Democrats, with the Reform Party, and identify as independent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump first talked about running for president in 1987, when he also opposed President Reagan\u0026rsquo;s foreign policy on offering foreign aid to countries such as Japan. From 1988 onwards, Trump generally identified as Republican or backed Republican candidates, with the exception of the George W. Bush administration period, during which he often took a stance as a Democrat against Bush\u0026rsquo;s policies.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Donald Trump\u0027s background","MetaDescription":"Born in June 1946, Donald Trump is a native of Queens, New York, and one of five children of Fred and Mary Trump.
