Following a halt of nuclear tests in North Korea after it improved its relationship with South Korea, the meeting served as further commitment from North Korea to accomplish denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>Trump and Kim Jong-un met in June 2018, where they signed a joint statement for a more peaceful relationship. It was a historic meeting, as it was the first time that a US president had ever met a North Korean leader.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="a2f0988e-6cd0-4547-b2c4-476e581e34cc">Russia investigation</h2><p>In February 2018, several Russian individuals and companies were charged by US federal prosecutors with interfering with the presidential election by using cyber hacking, the creation of false news, and the influence of government agencies to influence public opinion on Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. The defamation campaign against Clinton is thought to have taken place on mainstream media but also on social media, combined with spreading pro-Trump propaganda.</p><p>In April 2018, the FBI raided the office and home of Michael Cohen, Trump&rsquo;s personal attorney, investigating him for financial crimes and accusing him of paying an adult film actress in order to keep her alleged affair with Trump a secret.</p><p><strong>Several individuals were sentenced to prison for their ties with Russia during the campaign</strong>, and for lying to investigators about meetings with individuals connected with Russia.</p><p>In July 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report stating that election interference was conducted with the purpose of helping Trump win the election. Formal charges were also brought by the Justice Department against 12 members of a Russian intelligence agency, accusing them of hacking emails and computers linked with the Democratic Party during the presidential campaign.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="dffc93e4-4c73-4ccf-81e5-5b14e2217771">44th G7 summit</h2><p>The Group of Seven &ndash; leaders of the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada -&nbsp; held their annual meeting in June 2018 in Canada. The meeting was marked by tensions between the US and the other countries, as Donald Trump asked for Russia to be reinstated and the G8 to be formed again (it was reformatted as G7 after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014). Trump also asked that the other countries recognize Crimea as part of Russia, and called Ukraine a corrupt country.</p><p>The meeting had a negative outcome in the sense that Donald Trump refused to endorse the Paris climate change accord, refused to sign the final joint statement, and had a trade-related disagreement with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump and some of his officials spoke against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the summit as well, after learning that Trudeau intended to impose tariffs against the US.</p><p>Political commentators as well as the other leaders have denounced Trump&rsquo;s behavior as impulsive and individualistic, warning that it will damage international relations in the long run.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="488973b8-af60-40de-b46d-f5ea1fe345ea">Meeting with Vladimir Putin</h2><p>On 16th of July, 2018, President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin officially met in Helsinki, Finland to discuss relations between the US and Russia. This happened only a few days after 12 Russian intelligence officers were accused by the US of hacking.</p><p>During a press conference, both leaders addressed the rumors that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. Putin denied Russia&rsquo;s involvement, and Trump said he believed Putin had no reason to interfere, even though US intelligence agencies as well as fellow Republicans declared they were sure of Russia&rsquo;s interference in the vote. This led to strong criticism of Trump, <strong>as</strong> <strong>it implied that he trusted the words of a foreign leader more than the US&rsquo; own intelligence agencies</strong>.</p><p>Before the meeting, Trump had said on Twitter that the US and the investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election were at fault for the US&rsquo;s declining relationship with Russia. Trump repeated this statement during the press conference, emphasizing that his campaign was fair and that there was no collusion.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="0209f989-554c-4aaa-a273-8dc4abb4c7c1">The Brett Kavanaugh nomination</h2><p>On 9th of July, 2018, President Trump announced that he had picked Bret Kavanaugh for his second Supreme Court nomination since taking office in January 2017.</p><p>Kavanaugh was expected to be <strong>a conservative judge</strong>, which was seen as an issue by some, since his conservative stance meant that the Supreme Court would consist of a majority of conservative judges, which might lead to setbacks on progressive issues such as abortion rights and LGBT+ rights.</p><p>Kavanaugh confirmation hearing was held on 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> of September before the Judiciary Committee made of 11 Republican senators and 10 Democrat senators. The hearing was interrupted by protests against his confirmation.</p><p>On 16th of September, Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, <strong>accused Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge of sexually assaulting her 30 years before</strong>. Kavanaugh denied the accusation, and Ford&rsquo;s lawyers asked for an FBI investigation into her claims.</p><p>Donald Trump subsequently expressed his sympathy for Kavanaugh and for his family, stating that they are going through a difficult period. This led to criticism against Trump as it seemed that he was convinced of Kavanaugh&rsquo;s innocence and unconcerned about the serious accusations brought against him. <strong>It is also highly unusual for a President to take a stance in a criminal case before the case has been decided, and many viewed Trump&rsquo;s statements as an abuse of power</strong>.</p><p>Two other women came forward accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, but Kavanaugh denied both allegations.</p><p>On 27th of September, Ford and Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and were questioned by a special prosecutor. Ford recalled the incident and answered questions, remaining firm in her recollection that Kavanaugh assaulted her.</p><p>Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee subsequently agreed to ask Trump to order an FBI investigation into the allegations. Trump asked for the investigation to be completed in no more than a week. This request was also criticized for favoring Kavanaugh, as such little time was seen as insufficient for a complex investigation.</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s clear preference for Kavanaugh was also suggested by <strong>a public appearance in which he mocked Ford&rsquo;s testimony</strong>, implying that she invented the story of the assault. His comments were again highly criticized, even by Republicans.</p><p>Despite the public&rsquo;s pressure through large anti-Kavanaugh rallies, which led to hundreds of protestors being arrested, and what even some Judiciary Committee senators called an incomplete FBI investigation, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the US Supreme Court on 6<sup>th</sup> of October, 2018.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="1edc5713-714d-4bb3-9212-3434c8a71552">The anonymous New York Times editorial</h2><p>On 5<sup>th</sup> of September, 2018, the <em>New York Times</em> published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html">an anonymous essay entitled &ldquo;I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration&rdquo;</a>, allegedly written by a senior official in Trump&rsquo;s government.</p><p>In the article, the anonymous author identifies himself or herself as being part of a group of White House officials who try to support the administration while trying to <strong>keep the President from acting on his worst impulses</strong>.</p><p>The author mentions some of Trump&rsquo;s accomplishments, but generally portrays him as <strong>impulsive, unpredictable, and as having anti-democratic inclinations</strong>. The article seems to have several purposes. Firstly, the author wants to let the American people know that President Trump is not, as he often claims, supported by all his staff, or in complete control. However, the author also seems to want to reassure those who are disillusioned with Trump by <strong>suggesting that there are people around Trump who try to maintain American democracy</strong>. Finally, the author also sends a warning to the American people, emphasizing the need to remember shared values and to distance themselves from divisive ideas, even if some of them are promoted by the President himself.</p><p>After the article was published, <strong>President Trump attacked the anonymous author both at public events and on Twitter, implying that the article was an act of treason</strong>. Moreover, rumors surfaced that a search for the author was initiated at the White House. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, also issued a statement that criticized both the article and the <em>New York Times</em>, describing their actions as irresponsible and deceitful.</p><p>Note, however, that the idea of a &ldquo;team&rdquo; of officials trying to contain President Trump was not new at the time when the anonymous article was published. Other officials, such as former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, or Republican senator Bob Corker, claimed that many in the administration are trying to keep the nation safe from Trump&rsquo;s impulsive decisions.</p><p><strong>The anonymous author of the essay was also the subject of some&nbsp;public criticism.</strong> Specifically, critics of Trump have argued that publishing the article was an unwise move, as it would automatically make Trump suspicious of all members of his own staff, and therefore make it more difficult for the staff to control his &lsquo;worst impulses&rsquo; in the future. The essay might therefore end up hurting the cause of political stability that it claims to support.</p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="03199a6e-8d1e-4607-88a8-702928e35619">The bomb plot</h2><p>At the end of October 2018, several explosive devices were found at the homes or offices of prominent US Democratic figures, as well as at media headquarters.</p><p>The first explosive device was discovered at the home of <strong>George Soros</strong>, a billionaire philanthropist who is an outspoken supporter of the Democratic party and liberal policies. In the next days, explosive devices addressed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and former CIA Director John Brennan were also discovered. The one addressed to Brennan was found at CNN&rsquo;s New York offices, causing an evacuation of the building and the closing of the area surrounding it. Other suspicious packages were discovered, but none of the devices detonated.</p><p>Less than a week after the discovery of the first package, authorities captured and charged <strong>Cesar Sayoc</strong>, a 56-year-old man from Florida, with five federal crimes related to the packages. The media quickly reported on Sayoc&rsquo;s life and character &ndash; he was revealed to be a fervent Trump supporter with an extensive criminal record, whose social media profiles were filled with conspiracy theories and derogatory comments about Democrats. Sayoc appeared to be homeless, and was described as troubled by those who recognized him from the area where he lived in a van plastered with Trump stickers.</p><p>As these events unfolded a week before major mid-term elections, <strong>they sparked a national debate on the political climate in the US and Trump&rsquo;s role in encouraging such fanatics as Sayoc to take action in harmful ways</strong>.</p><p>Trump himself denounced the violence behind Sayoc&rsquo;s acts and called for unity, but also underlined that he is not responsible for them and that his critics were trying to distract attention from the mid-terms. Moreover, a few days later, Trump insulted one of the targets of the bomb plot, billionaire Tom Steyer &ndash; who is also a supporter of Trump&rsquo;s impeachment - over Twitter.</p><p>Despite not having any direct connections with the man behind the attempted bombings, <strong>critics have argued that Trump still bears some responsibility, because his violent rhetoric might incite mentally unstable people to drastic actions</strong>. For example, Trump frequently refers to the mainstream media as &ldquo;the enemy of the people&rdquo;, and he has even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-greg-gianforte-assault-guardian-ben-jacobs">directly&nbsp; praised people who were guilty of violence against journalists</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-8" data-guid="05e876d0-4903-405b-add8-111049824d33">The Central American migrant caravan</h2><p>The migrant caravan is a group of Central Americans, mostly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador, who have made the decision to head towards the US, hoping to escape poverty and gang violence in their countries.</p><p>The caravan began with a group of 160 Hondurans on 12<sup>th</sup> of October, 2018, and was joined by thousands as it made its journey towards the US. The migrants aimed to apply for asylum in Mexico or the US under current US and international law.</p><p>The migrants were met with opposition from the authorities in Guatemala, who closed borders and tried to stop the caravan by force, but eventually let them through. Some of the caravan members were admitted to Mexico, but many others have grown desperate and entered without papers.</p><p>A large group continued its march towards the US, despite strong opposition from Trump&rsquo;s administration. Trump has labeled the approaching caravan as an invasion, has warned against the criminals among the migrants, and sent thousands of troops to the border by the end of October 2018.</p><p>However, under US law, the military cannot detain the migrants, and can only assist officials in providing assistance to the migrants, or reinforce the border&rsquo;s infrastructure. Trump&rsquo;s opponents have therefore commented that Trump was only trying to boost his reputation by creating the appearance that he is defending the US.</p><p>Moreover, as these events unfolded before the 2018 mid-terms, Trump was accused of creating the imaginary threat of an invasion in order to persuade Americans to vote Republican.</p><h2 id="heading-9" data-guid="a974501c-800e-43d6-8ae8-9a06fcc78b18">The 2018 mid-term election</h2><p>The 2018 mid-term elections represented hundreds of congressional, state and local primaries, which culminated with a general election on 6<sup>th</sup> of November. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House and for 35 out of 100 seats in the Senate, as well as for state governors.</p><p>The election was seen as a major challenge for the Republican Party and for President Donald Trump, as Democrats had the chance to win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, and had a slight chance in the Senate as well. With Democrats controlling the House, Trump would have a more difficult time pushing his administration&rsquo;s agenda.</p><p>The election came after an extensive political and media campaign in which Trump held 30 rallies during two months.</p><p>The result of the election was that<strong> the Republicans expanded their control over the Senate, while Democrats gained power in the House of Representatives.</strong> The Democrat win has been attributed to a large voter turnout, a potential consequence of the 55 percent disapproval rating for President Trump.</p><p>Even as Democrats were projected to win the House, Trump bragged on Twitter about the Republican win, calling it &ldquo;a very Big Win&rdquo;. He emphasized the victory of the party, saying that it happened despite pressure from hostile media. However, he also unexpectedly congratulated Democrat Nancy Pelosi for being chosen Speaker of the House.</p><h2 id="heading-10" data-guid="6b4d14f9-b61f-403a-b201-e720201e5dc2">The border wall and government shutdown</h2><p>On midnight, December 21<sup>st</sup> in 2018, budget negotiations between Trump and Congress broke down, which led to a <strong>government shutdown</strong>. The disagreement was centered on the issue of funding for Donald Trump&rsquo;s promised border wall between the US and Mexico.</p><p>A government shutdown occurs when no agreement is reached about the coming years budget when the funding for the current year has run out. The shutdown means that <strong>&lsquo;non-essential&rsquo; government services are shut down</strong> because they are no longer funded. This affects numerous services and agencies, including the Department of Labor, the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. Many workers in these agencies are sent home while the shutdown is ongoing, but those who are deemed essential are instead forced to work without pay. It is estimated that the&nbsp;shutdown affects around 800,000 workers, not to mention the further problems that arise from many sections of the government not functioning.</p><p><strong>Further negotiations between Trump and Congress have proven difficult</strong>. Trump remains firm on his demand for funding for his border wall, but the Democrats refuse to give it to him, and insist that the money can be spent much better elsewhere. Both sides seek to blame each other for the shutdown, but neither show signs of giving up.</p><p>Trump tried to increase public support for his position through a televised address from the Oval Office on January 9 2019, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/08/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-the-border-crisis-1069539">but fact-checking showed that his speech was full of misleading or false statements.</a></p><p>Trump has also hinted that he has the power to declare a <strong>national emergency</strong> to secure funding for the wall <em>without</em> the approval of Congress, but this would be an highly controversial tactic, which would almost certainly lead to legal challenges. Trump claims that this extreme gesture could be justified because of the &lsquo;border crisis&rsquo;, but critics argue that Trump greatly exaggerates the extent of this supposed crisis.&nbsp; So far, Trump has been unwilling to follow through with his threat, stating that he would prefer to find a solution through negotiations.</p><p>The most recent development in the story is that Trump has angrily left a meeting with Democrat negotiators, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/09/shutdown-trump-border-wall-demand">claiming that it was &ldquo;a total waste of time&rdquo;</a>. The Democrats at the meeting accused Trump of throwing a temper tantrum. It remains to be seen whether Trump will use his emergency powers as his response to this further breakdown of negotiations.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="the-first-year.html" title="The first year of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency (2017-2018)" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The first year</span></a><a href="the-third-year.html" title="The third year of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency (2019-2020)" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The third year</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The defamation campaign against Clinton is thought to have taken place on mainstream media but also on social media, combined with spreading pro-Trump propaganda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn April 2018, the FBI raided the office and home of Michael Cohen, Trump\u0026rsquo;s personal attorney, investigating him for financial crimes and accusing him of paying an adult film actress in order to keep her alleged affair with Trump a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeveral individuals were sentenced to prison for their ties with Russia during the campaign\u003c/strong\u003e, and for lying to investigators about meetings with individuals connected with Russia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn July 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report stating that election interference was conducted with the purpose of helping Trump win the election.

The meeting was marked by tensions between the US and the other countries, as Donald Trump asked for Russia to be reinstated and the G8 to be formed again (it was reformatted as G7 after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014). Trump also asked that the other countries recognize Crimea as part of Russia, and called Ukraine a corrupt country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe meeting had a negative outcome in the sense that Donald Trump refused to endorse the Paris climate change accord, refused to sign the final joint statement, and had a trade-related disagreement with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump and some of his officials spoke against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the summit as well, after learning that Trudeau intended to impose tariffs against the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitical commentators as well as the other leaders have denounced Trump\u0026rsquo;s behavior as impulsive and individualistic, warning that it will damage international relations in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022488973b8-af60-40de-b46d-f5ea1fe345ea\u0022\u003eMeeting with Vladimir Putin\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 16th of July, 2018, President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin officially met in Helsinki, Finland to discuss relations between the US and Russia. This happened only a few days after 12 Russian intelligence officers were accused by the US of hacking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring a press conference, both leaders addressed the rumors that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. Putin denied Russia\u0026rsquo;s involvement, and Trump said he believed Putin had no reason to interfere, even though US intelligence agencies as well as fellow Republicans declared they were sure of Russia\u0026rsquo;s interference in the vote. This led to strong criticism of Trump, \u003cstrong\u003eas\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eit implied that he trusted the words of a foreign leader more than the US\u0026rsquo; own intelligence agencies\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore the meeting, Trump had said on Twitter that the US and the investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election were at fault for the US\u0026rsquo;s declining relationship with Russia. Trump repeated this statement during the press conference, emphasizing that his campaign was fair and that there was no collusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u00220209f989-554c-4aaa-a273-8dc4abb4c7c1\u0022\u003eThe Brett Kavanaugh nomination\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 9th of July, 2018, President Trump announced that he had picked Bret Kavanaugh for his second Supreme Court nomination since taking office in January 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKavanaugh was expected to be \u003cstrong\u003ea conservative judge\u003c/strong\u003e, which was seen as an issue by some, since his conservative stance meant that the Supreme Court would consist of a majority of conservative judges, which might lead to setbacks on progressive issues such as abortion rights and LGBT+ rights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKavanaugh confirmation hearing was held on 5\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e and 6\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of September before the Judiciary Committee made of 11 Republican senators and 10 Democrat senators. The hearing was interrupted by protests against his confirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 16th of September, Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, \u003cstrong\u003eaccused Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge of sexually assaulting her 30 years before\u003c/strong\u003e. Kavanaugh denied the accusation, and Ford\u0026rsquo;s lawyers asked for an FBI investigation into her claims.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump subsequently expressed his sympathy for Kavanaugh and for his family, stating that they are going through a difficult period. This led to criticism against Trump as it seemed that he was convinced of Kavanaugh\u0026rsquo;s innocence and unconcerned about the serious accusations brought against him. \u003cstrong\u003eIt is also highly unusual for a President to take a stance in a criminal case before the case has been decided, and many viewed Trump\u0026rsquo;s statements as an abuse of power\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo other women came forward accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, but Kavanaugh denied both allegations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 27th of September, Ford and Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and were questioned by a special prosecutor. Ford recalled the incident and answered questions, remaining firm in her recollection that Kavanaugh assaulted her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee subsequently agreed to ask Trump to order an FBI investigation into the allegations. Trump asked for the investigation to be completed in no more than a week. This request was also criticized for favoring Kavanaugh, as such little time was seen as insufficient for a complex investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s clear preference for Kavanaugh was also suggested by \u003cstrong\u003ea public appearance in which he mocked Ford\u0026rsquo;s testimony\u003c/strong\u003e, implying that she invented the story of the assault. His comments were again highly criticized, even by Republicans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the public\u0026rsquo;s pressure through large anti-Kavanaugh rallies, which led to hundreds of protestors being arrested, and what even some Judiciary Committee senators called an incomplete FBI investigation, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the US Supreme Court on 6\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of October, 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u00221edc5713-714d-4bb3-9212-3434c8a71552\u0022\u003eThe anonymous New York Times editorial\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 5\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of September, 2018, the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e published \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html\u0022\u003ean anonymous essay entitled \u0026ldquo;I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e, allegedly written by a senior official in Trump\u0026rsquo;s government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the article, the anonymous author identifies himself or herself as being part of a group of White House officials who try to support the administration while trying to \u003cstrong\u003ekeep the President from acting on his worst impulses\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe author mentions some of Trump\u0026rsquo;s accomplishments, but generally portrays him as \u003cstrong\u003eimpulsive, unpredictable, and as having anti-democratic inclinations\u003c/strong\u003e. The article seems to have several purposes. Firstly, the author wants to let the American people know that President Trump is not, as he often claims, supported by all his staff, or in complete control. However, the author also seems to want to reassure those who are disillusioned with Trump by \u003cstrong\u003esuggesting that there are people around Trump who try to maintain American democracy\u003c/strong\u003e. Finally, the author also sends a warning to the American people, emphasizing the need to remember shared values and to distance themselves from divisive ideas, even if some of them are promoted by the President himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the article was published, \u003cstrong\u003ePresident Trump attacked the anonymous author both at public events and on Twitter, implying that the article was an act of treason\u003c/strong\u003e. Moreover, rumors surfaced that a search for the author was initiated at the White House. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, also issued a statement that criticized both the article and the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, describing their actions as irresponsible and deceitful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote, however, that the idea of a \u0026ldquo;team\u0026rdquo; of officials trying to contain President Trump was not new at the time when the anonymous article was published. Other officials, such as former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, or Republican senator Bob Corker, claimed that many in the administration are trying to keep the nation safe from Trump\u0026rsquo;s impulsive decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe anonymous author of the essay was also the subject of some\u0026nbsp;public criticism.\u003c/strong\u003e Specifically, critics of Trump have argued that publishing the article was an unwise move, as it would automatically make Trump suspicious of all members of his own staff, and therefore make it more difficult for the staff to control his \u0026lsquo;worst impulses\u0026rsquo; in the future. The essay might therefore end up hurting the cause of political stability that it claims to support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022 data-guid=\u002203199a6e-8d1e-4607-88a8-702928e35619\u0022\u003eThe bomb plot\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of October 2018, several explosive devices were found at the homes or offices of prominent US Democratic figures, as well as at media headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first explosive device was discovered at the home of \u003cstrong\u003eGeorge Soros\u003c/strong\u003e, a billionaire philanthropist who is an outspoken supporter of the Democratic party and liberal policies. In the next days, explosive devices addressed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and former CIA Director John Brennan were also discovered. The one addressed to Brennan was found at CNN\u0026rsquo;s New York offices, causing an evacuation of the building and the closing of the area surrounding it. Other suspicious packages were discovered, but none of the devices detonated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLess than a week after the discovery of the first package, authorities captured and charged \u003cstrong\u003eCesar Sayoc\u003c/strong\u003e, a 56-year-old man from Florida, with five federal crimes related to the packages. The media quickly reported on Sayoc\u0026rsquo;s life and character \u0026ndash; he was revealed to be a fervent Trump supporter with an extensive criminal record, whose social media profiles were filled with conspiracy theories and derogatory comments about Democrats. Sayoc appeared to be homeless, and was described as troubled by those who recognized him from the area where he lived in a van plastered with Trump stickers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs these events unfolded a week before major mid-term elections, \u003cstrong\u003ethey sparked a national debate on the political climate in the US and Trump\u0026rsquo;s role in encouraging such fanatics as Sayoc to take action in harmful ways\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump himself denounced the violence behind Sayoc\u0026rsquo;s acts and called for unity, but also underlined that he is not responsible for them and that his critics were trying to distract attention from the mid-terms. Moreover, a few days later, Trump insulted one of the targets of the bomb plot, billionaire Tom Steyer \u0026ndash; who is also a supporter of Trump\u0026rsquo;s impeachment - over Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite not having any direct connections with the man behind the attempted bombings, \u003cstrong\u003ecritics have argued that Trump still bears some responsibility, because his violent rhetoric might incite mentally unstable people to drastic actions\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, Trump frequently refers to the mainstream media as \u0026ldquo;the enemy of the people\u0026rdquo;, and he has even \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-greg-gianforte-assault-guardian-ben-jacobs\u0022\u003edirectly\u0026nbsp; praised people who were guilty of violence against journalists\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022 data-guid=\u002205e876d0-4903-405b-add8-111049824d33\u0022\u003eThe Central American migrant caravan\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe migrant caravan is a group of Central Americans, mostly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador, who have made the decision to head towards the US, hoping to escape poverty and gang violence in their countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe caravan began with a group of 160 Hondurans on 12\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of October, 2018, and was joined by thousands as it made its journey towards the US. The migrants aimed to apply for asylum in Mexico or the US under current US and international law.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe migrants were met with opposition from the authorities in Guatemala, who closed borders and tried to stop the caravan by force, but eventually let them through. Some of the caravan members were admitted to Mexico, but many others have grown desperate and entered without papers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA large group continued its march towards the US, despite strong opposition from Trump\u0026rsquo;s administration. Trump has labeled the approaching caravan as an invasion, has warned against the criminals among the migrants, and sent thousands of troops to the border by the end of October 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, under US law, the military cannot detain the migrants, and can only assist officials in providing assistance to the migrants, or reinforce the border\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure. Trump\u0026rsquo;s opponents have therefore commented that Trump was only trying to boost his reputation by creating the appearance that he is defending the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, as these events unfolded before the 2018 mid-terms, Trump was accused of creating the imaginary threat of an invasion in order to persuade Americans to vote Republican.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-9\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a974501c-800e-43d6-8ae8-9a06fcc78b18\u0022\u003eThe 2018 mid-term election\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 2018 mid-term elections represented hundreds of congressional, state and local primaries, which culminated with a general election on 6\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of November. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House and for 35 out of 100 seats in the Senate, as well as for state governors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe election was seen as a major challenge for the Republican Party and for President Donald Trump, as Democrats had the chance to win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, and had a slight chance in the Senate as well. With Democrats controlling the House, Trump would have a more difficult time pushing his administration\u0026rsquo;s agenda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe election came after an extensive political and media campaign in which Trump held 30 rallies during two months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe result of the election was that\u003cstrong\u003e the Republicans expanded their control over the Senate, while Democrats gained power in the House of Representatives.\u003c/strong\u003e The Democrat win has been attributed to a large voter turnout, a potential consequence of the 55 percent disapproval rating for President Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven as Democrats were projected to win the House, Trump bragged on Twitter about the Republican win, calling it \u0026ldquo;a very Big Win\u0026rdquo;.

The disagreement was centered on the issue of funding for Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s promised border wall between the US and Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA government shutdown occurs when no agreement is reached about the coming years budget when the funding for the current year has run out. The shutdown means that \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lsquo;non-essential\u0026rsquo; government services are shut down\u003c/strong\u003e because they are no longer funded. This affects numerous services and agencies, including the Department of Labor, the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency.

It is estimated that the\u0026nbsp;shutdown affects around 800,000 workers, not to mention the further problems that arise from many sections of the government not functioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurther negotiations between Trump and Congress have proven difficult\u003c/strong\u003e.
