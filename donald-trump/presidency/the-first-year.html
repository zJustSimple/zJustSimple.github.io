Obama&rsquo;s ACA was an attempt to push the country in a more European direction, by creating an enforced system of medical insurance that would extend healthcare coverage to a much greater number of people. However, the system was strongly criticised by Republicans, who claimed that it was both unjust and inefficient.</p><p>Shortly after taking office, Trump made the first step for the repeal and replacement of ACA by signing an executive order and choosing Tom Price, a long-time opponent of ACA, as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>In February 2017, Congressional Republicans proposed the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to replace ACA. <strong>However, the act was quickly rejected by both Republicans and Democrats</strong>. Republicans were dissatisfied because they claimed that AHCA resembled ACA too much, and that the federal government was still responsible for providing healthcare. Democrats, in turn, estimated that millions of Americans, especially the poor and the older population, would lose their medical insurance under AHCA. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that more than 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 under AHCA.</p><p>In March 2017, Republicans pulled the bill when they realized it would not get enough votes to pass. Three months later, even President Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the bill, since it did not fit his promise that he would provide affordable coverage to all Americans. In the following months, several updated bills were proposed but did not gain enough support from Republicans. Simultaneously, other bills were proposed for the repeal of ACA, or for changes in how ACA was implemented.</p><p>In 2018, Trump and his administration implemented some new rules concerning healthcare&ndash; according to health experts, some increased overall costs of insurance, while others provided easier access to health care by giving access to more limited, and thus cheaper, health plans.</p><p><strong>Overall, the Trump administration has not succeeded in its promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare</strong>, and chose to change it step by step. This was the first major failure for Trump, because repealing ACA should in theory have been easy, because the Republicans had control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives at the time.</p><h2 data-guid="2d02a305-9692-411b-9ba0-d9a574e3c7c2" id="heading-2">Muslim travel ban</h2><p>During his campaign, Trump talked about national security concerns, and warned that admitting refugees &ndash; or even ordinary travellers &ndash; from Middle Eastern or Muslim-majority countries could mean that the US is letting terrorists into the country. He talked about a possible registry of Muslims in the country and asked for a screening procedure which could stop extremists from entering the US.</p><p>In January 2017, <strong>Trump tried to block immigration with an executive order that blocked refugees and entry visas permanently or temporarily from seven countries, including Iran, Iraq and Syria</strong>. The order&rsquo;s immediate implementation caused a chaotic atmosphere in airports around the world and sparked protests, while several legal actions were taken against the order.</p><p>A federal court in Seattle soon blocked the order, which was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals&rsquo; three judges. A revised order was signed in March but was blocked by the court as well. However, a partial ban was upheld in June 2018 by the Supreme Court, banning people from Libya, Iran, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, and placing limits on people from Venezuela and North Korea.</p><h2 data-guid="ccc04d43-230f-406c-8b37-0ceaf928183c" id="heading-3">The Paris Agreement</h2><p>At the beginning of June 2017, President Trump declared that the US would withdraw from a 2015 international agreement &ndash; called the Paris agreement &ndash; through which 196 nations committed to fight climate change by investing in clean energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Trump, a denier of the human impact on climate change, motivated his decision by saying that the agreement is not financially fair to the United States. Moreover, the agreement, which called for reduced fossil fuels use, was at odds with Trump&rsquo;s campaign promise to revive the US&rsquo;s dying coal industry, in order to create more jobs and reduce the nation&rsquo;s reliance on foreign fuel.</p><p>Trump also expressed his willingness to re-enter the agreement at a later date, but only after negotiations which would put the US in a better position.</p><p><strong>The reactions to his announcement have generally been negative</strong>, with politicians, scientists, and even major oil and energy companies calling for the US to remain a part of the agreement.</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s decision was mostly symbolic, since the Paris agreement&rsquo;s regulations does not make it possible for the US to actually withdraw until the end of 2020. However, as some have noted, the US, one of the world&rsquo;s major polluters, could take steps to reduce its participation in the agreement before the formal withdrawal.</p><p>One year later, <strong>a positive side-effect</strong> of Trump&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the US from the pact has been observed, as other countries have pledged to increase their efforts to fight climate change. Trump&rsquo;s stance on climate change also sparked change in the US &ndash; for example, US company Patagonia, which benefitted from a large tax cut, has announced it will donate 10 million dollars to environmental programs, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/business/patagonia-10-million-tax-climate-change-trnd/index.html">citing President Trump&rsquo;s climate change denial as a reason.</a></p><h2 data-guid="e6a8f9f7-a6df-4754-81a8-12c080533bfb" id="heading-4">Charlottesville</h2><p>In February 2017, the City Council of Charlottesville, Virginia, announced that it would remove a statue of Confederate war hero Robert E. Lee from the city. The decision sparked protests and lawsuits, which culminated in demonstrations and violence between protestors and counter-protestors. A demonstration in August resulted in <strong>the death of a woman after she was deliberately hit with a car by one of the protestors.</strong></p><p>At the time, Trump called for unity and an end to violence, but <strong>condemned both sides for their actions</strong>. Because many of the protestors were white nationalists who chanted racist and Nazi-associated phrases, Trump&rsquo;s remarks were met with criticism and accusations that he holds racist views as well. Days later, Trump specifically condemned the actions of neo-Nazis and the KKK.</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s statements also indicated that he supported the existence of Confederate monuments. Because the Confederacy fought to maintain slavery, this was seen as another sign of Trump&rsquo;s racist views. Trump, on the other hand, defended himself by saying that these monuments should exist because they represent a part of American history.</p><h2 data-guid="e6478692-99fd-40f6-ba13-a4eb7550f49f" id="heading-5">The beginning of the Russia investigation</h2><p>One of the most serious controversies surrounding Donald Trump&rsquo;s campaign and presidency was the Russia scandal, and the investigation that followed. In 2016, several federal agencies <strong>accused Russia of being involved in a complex campaign which used hackers and social media to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump</strong>. Moreover, potential connections between Russians and the Trump campaign were also investigated, as they were a source of concern for possible collusion between the two.</p><p>Despite proof that Russia interfered with the election, President Trump denied this possibility, blaming Democrats for making up this story because Hillary Clinton unexpectedly lost the election.</p><p>Another part of the scandal was the firing of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, who at the time was directing the investigation into Russia&rsquo;s involvement in the election. Some believed that Trump tried to delay the investigation by firing Comey, and Comey later testified that Trump personally asked him to stop investigating Michael Flynn. Flynn briefly held the position of national security advisor in the Trump administration, but resigned after it was found that he lied to White House officials about possibly illegal meetings with a Russian ambassador.</p><p>The controversy surrounding Flynn was seen by some as another potential sign of collusion between Trump and Russia.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-guid="4777312c-c711-4d4c-9b98-ef382dcbdd06" id="heading-6">Border Wall progress</h2><p>From the beginning of his campaign, Donald Trump talked about how he would stop illegal immigrants from Mexico coming into the US by <strong>building a big wall on the US-Mexico border</strong>. He also claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall, an idea which progressed, over time, into Mexico reimbursing the US or paying some form of tax after the US builds the wall.</p><p>In January 2017, Trump signed the &ldquo;Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements&rdquo; executive order that laid out plans for building the wall. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a January trip to the White House and publicly stated that Mexico would not pay for the wall.</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans <strong>expressed their concerns for the immense costs of the wall and questioned its efficiency</strong>. Government reports estimated that the wall would cost more than 2o billion dollars, three times the cost estimated by Donald Trump, and that construction would last for at least three years. &nbsp;</p><p>In September, wall prototypes began to be constructed in San Diego County; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit against the administration for environmental concerns. In December, a violent clash took place between supporters and protestors against the wall, and existing fences at the border were partially replaced. In January 2018, the wall prototypes in San Diego were tested by military Special Forces.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - Donald Trump's Immigration Speech</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>Though this speech was made before Trump became President, it provides a good overview of his stance on illegal immigration and border security. He outlines a number of planned policies to prevent illegal immigration, the most important one being the border wall (which he promises Mexico will pay for).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div><h2 data-guid="87356ed8-0bbc-450c-bf87-232bafff2fdb" id="heading-7">Las Vegas shooting</h2><p>On the night of 1<sup>st</sup> of October, 2017, 58 people were killed and more than 800 were injured by a gunman who opened fire on the crowd attending a concert in Las Vegas, Nevada. The attack became <strong>the deadliest mass shooting in modern US&nbsp; history</strong>.</p><p>The attacker, who opened fire from the window of his hotel room, was found dead in his room. He had multiple firearms in his possession, and used bump stocks to fire his semi-automatic rifles at a similar rate to that of an automatic rifle. This led to a proposal for bump stocks to be banned in the US.</p><p>Although President Trump condemned the attack and praised the intervention of the authorities in stopping it, some criticized him for a late reaction. Moreover, in the days to come, people noted how Trump <strong>did not get involved in the debate over gun control which was renewed after the attack</strong>. Gun control was not a key issue in Trump&rsquo;s election campaign, but he was financially supported by the National Rifle Association in his campaign. Moreover, his administration took steps to eliminate some gun regulations which came into effect while Barack Obama was President.</p><p>Trump was also criticized on social media for not calling the attacker a terrorist, as he had done in similar circumstances with non-white attackers in the past.</p><h2 data-guid="e457f11c-ee6e-45c1-b788-65829df32dc3" id="heading-8">Beginning of the North Korean crisis</h2><p>The crisis began in 2017 when North Korea conducted missile and nuclear test. This suggested that North Korea had the ability to launch long-range missiles, which surprised the US, as it had not anticipated that North Korea could expand its nuclear arsenal.</p><p>Leaders of several nations then received an open letter from North Korea&rsquo;s leader Kim Jong-un. The letter contained threats to the US and described North Korea as a powerful nuclear power.

However, the system was strongly criticised by Republicans, who claimed that it was both unjust and inefficient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after taking office, Trump made the first step for the repeal and replacement of ACA by signing an executive order and choosing Tom Price, a long-time opponent of ACA, as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February 2017, Congressional Republicans proposed the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to replace ACA. \u003cstrong\u003eHowever, the act was quickly rejected by both Republicans and Democrats\u003c/strong\u003e. Republicans were dissatisfied because they claimed that AHCA resembled ACA too much, and that the federal government was still responsible for providing healthcare. Democrats, in turn, estimated that millions of Americans, especially the poor and the older population, would lose their medical insurance under AHCA. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that more than 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 under AHCA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn March 2017, Republicans pulled the bill when they realized it would not get enough votes to pass. Three months later, even President Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the bill, since it did not fit his promise that he would provide affordable coverage to all Americans. In the following months, several updated bills were proposed but did not gain enough support from Republicans. Simultaneously, other bills were proposed for the repeal of ACA, or for changes in how ACA was implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, Trump and his administration implemented some new rules concerning healthcare\u0026ndash; according to health experts, some increased overall costs of insurance, while others provided easier access to health care by giving access to more limited, and thus cheaper, health plans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverall, the Trump administration has not succeeded in its promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare\u003c/strong\u003e, and chose to change it step by step. This was the first major failure for Trump, because repealing ACA should in theory have been easy, because the Republicans had control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00222d02a305-9692-411b-9ba0-d9a574e3c7c2\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003eMuslim travel ban\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring his campaign, Trump talked about national security concerns, and warned that admitting refugees \u0026ndash; or even ordinary travellers \u0026ndash; from Middle Eastern or Muslim-majority countries could mean that the US is letting terrorists into the country. He talked about a possible registry of Muslims in the country and asked for a screening procedure which could stop extremists from entering the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn January 2017, \u003cstrong\u003eTrump tried to block immigration with an executive order that blocked refugees and entry visas permanently or temporarily from seven countries, including Iran, Iraq and Syria\u003c/strong\u003e. The order\u0026rsquo;s immediate implementation caused a chaotic atmosphere in airports around the world and sparked protests, while several legal actions were taken against the order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA federal court in Seattle soon blocked the order, which was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u0026rsquo; three judges. A revised order was signed in March but was blocked by the court as well. However, a partial ban was upheld in June 2018 by the Supreme Court, banning people from Libya, Iran, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, and placing limits on people from Venezuela and North Korea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022ccc04d43-230f-406c-8b37-0ceaf928183c\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eThe Paris Agreement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of June 2017, President Trump declared that the US would withdraw from a 2015 international agreement \u0026ndash; called the Paris agreement \u0026ndash; through which 196 nations committed to fight climate change by investing in clean energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump, a denier of the human impact on climate change, motivated his decision by saying that the agreement is not financially fair to the United States. Moreover, the agreement, which called for reduced fossil fuels use, was at odds with Trump\u0026rsquo;s campaign promise to revive the US\u0026rsquo;s dying coal industry, in order to create more jobs and reduce the nation\u0026rsquo;s reliance on foreign fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump also expressed his willingness to re-enter the agreement at a later date, but only after negotiations which would put the US in a better position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe reactions to his announcement have generally been negative\u003c/strong\u003e, with politicians, scientists, and even major oil and energy companies calling for the US to remain a part of the agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s decision was mostly symbolic, since the Paris agreement\u0026rsquo;s regulations does not make it possible for the US to actually withdraw until the end of 2020. However, as some have noted, the US, one of the world\u0026rsquo;s major polluters, could take steps to reduce its participation in the agreement before the formal withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne year later, \u003cstrong\u003ea positive side-effect\u003c/strong\u003e of Trump\u0026rsquo;s decision to withdraw the US from the pact has been observed, as other countries have pledged to increase their efforts to fight climate change. Trump\u0026rsquo;s stance on climate change also sparked change in the US \u0026ndash; for example, US company Patagonia, which benefitted from a large tax cut, has announced it will donate 10 million dollars to environmental programs, \u003ca href=\u0022https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/business/patagonia-10-million-tax-climate-change-trnd/index.html\u0022\u003eciting President Trump\u0026rsquo;s climate change denial as a reason.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022e6a8f9f7-a6df-4754-81a8-12c080533bfb\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eCharlottesville\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February 2017, the City Council of Charlottesville, Virginia, announced that it would remove a statue of Confederate war hero Robert E. Lee from the city. The decision sparked protests and lawsuits, which culminated in demonstrations and violence between protestors and counter-protestors. A demonstration in August resulted in \u003cstrong\u003ethe death of a woman after she was deliberately hit with a car by one of the protestors.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time, Trump called for unity and an end to violence, but \u003cstrong\u003econdemned both sides for their actions\u003c/strong\u003e. Because many of the protestors were white nationalists who chanted racist and Nazi-associated phrases, Trump\u0026rsquo;s remarks were met with criticism and accusations that he holds racist views as well. Days later, Trump specifically condemned the actions of neo-Nazis and the KKK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s statements also indicated that he supported the existence of Confederate monuments. Because the Confederacy fought to maintain slavery, this was seen as another sign of Trump\u0026rsquo;s racist views. Trump, on the other hand, defended himself by saying that these monuments should exist because they represent a part of American history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022e6478692-99fd-40f6-ba13-a4eb7550f49f\u0022 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022\u003eThe beginning of the Russia investigation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most serious controversies surrounding Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s campaign and presidency was the Russia scandal, and the investigation that followed. In 2016, several federal agencies \u003cstrong\u003eaccused Russia of being involved in a complex campaign which used hackers and social media to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump\u003c/strong\u003e. Moreover, potential connections between Russians and the Trump campaign were also investigated, as they were a source of concern for possible collusion between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite proof that Russia interfered with the election, President Trump denied this possibility, blaming Democrats for making up this story because Hillary Clinton unexpectedly lost the election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother part of the scandal was the firing of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, who at the time was directing the investigation into Russia\u0026rsquo;s involvement in the election. Some believed that Trump tried to delay the investigation by firing Comey, and Comey later testified that Trump personally asked him to stop investigating Michael Flynn. Flynn briefly held the position of national security advisor in the Trump administration, but resigned after it was found that he lied to White House officials about possibly illegal meetings with a Russian ambassador.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe controversy surrounding Flynn was seen by some as another potential sign of collusion between Trump and Russia.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00224777312c-c711-4d4c-9b98-ef382dcbdd06\u0022 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022\u003eBorder Wall progress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning of his campaign, Donald Trump talked about how he would stop illegal immigrants from Mexico coming into the US by \u003cstrong\u003ebuilding a big wall on the US-Mexico border\u003c/strong\u003e. He also claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall, an idea which progressed, over time, into Mexico reimbursing the US or paying some form of tax after the US builds the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn January 2017, Trump signed the \u0026ldquo;Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\u0026rdquo; executive order that laid out plans for building the wall. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a January trip to the White House and publicly stated that Mexico would not pay for the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Democrats and Republicans \u003cstrong\u003eexpressed their concerns for the immense costs of the wall and questioned its efficiency\u003c/strong\u003e. Government reports estimated that the wall would cost more than 2o billion dollars, three times the cost estimated by Donald Trump, and that construction would last for at least three years. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn September, wall prototypes began to be constructed in San Diego County; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit against the administration for environmental concerns. In December, a violent clash took place between supporters and protestors against the wall, and existing fences at the border were partially replaced. In January 2018, the wall prototypes in San Diego were tested by military Special Forces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - Donald Trump\u0027s Immigration Speech\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eThough this speech was made before Trump became President, it provides a good overview of his stance on illegal immigration and border security. He outlines a number of planned policies to prevent illegal immigration, the most important one being the border wall (which he promises Mexico will pay for).\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002287356ed8-0bbc-450c-bf87-232bafff2fdb\u0022 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022\u003eLas Vegas shooting\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the night of 1\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e of October, 2017, 58 people were killed and more than 800 were injured by a gunman who opened fire on the crowd attending a concert in Las Vegas, Nevada. The attack became \u003cstrong\u003ethe deadliest mass shooting in modern US\u0026nbsp; history\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attacker, who opened fire from the window of his hotel room, was found dead in his room. He had multiple firearms in his possession, and used bump stocks to fire his semi-automatic rifles at a similar rate to that of an automatic rifle. This led to a proposal for bump stocks to be banned in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough President Trump condemned the attack and praised the intervention of the authorities in stopping it, some criticized him for a late reaction. Moreover, in the days to come, people noted how Trump \u003cstrong\u003edid not get involved in the debate over gun control which was renewed after the attack\u003c/strong\u003e. Gun control was not a key issue in Trump\u0026rsquo;s election campaign, but he was financially supported by the National Rifle Association in his campaign. Moreover, his administration took steps to eliminate some gun regulations which came into effect while Barack Obama was President.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump was also criticized on social media for not calling the attacker a terrorist, as he had done in similar circumstances with non-white attackers in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022e457f11c-ee6e-45c1-b788-65829df32dc3\u0022 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022\u003eBeginning of the North Korean crisis\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crisis began in 2017 when North Korea conducted missile and nuclear test.
