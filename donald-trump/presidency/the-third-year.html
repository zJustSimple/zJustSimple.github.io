However, Trump tried to spin the story in a more positive light, and maintained his claims about border security being a top priority.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill that ended the shutdown only provided temporary funding, so a new solution had to be found before February 15th. As the&nbsp;deadline approached, Democrats and Republicans came together in the House and Senate to <strong>finally approve a lasting funding bill</strong>. The bill provided $1.375 billion&nbsp;for 'more fencing' and other border security measures, but not nearly the $5.7 billion that Trump wanted for his border wall - yet another&nbsp;political defeat for him.</p><p>However, Trump <strong>proceeded to declare a national emergency</strong>, allowing him to <strong>bypass Congress in order to get the money</strong> needed to build his wall. This move has been heavily criticised by both Democrats and some Republicans, and it is expected that Trump will face many legal challenges because of his controversial move.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="c8a7a9ce-773e-4115-9ac3-786b4c200449">Second North Korea summit</h2><p>In he final week of February, Donald Trump attended a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The summit took place in Vietnam, on neutral ground.</p><p>The purpose of the meeting was to discuss <strong>a possible nuclear deal with North Korea</strong> &ndash; ideally resulting in nuclear disarmament on the North Korean side, and in lifting of sanctions on the US side. Talks initially seemed to be going well, but then Trump abruptly decided to cut the summit short, <strong>walking away with no concrete deal on the table</strong>.</p><p>It is unclear exactly what caused the talks to break down, but the Trump administration has stated that it turned out Kim Jong-Un expected all sanctions to be lifted in exchange for only partial nuclear disarmament &ndash; which would have been a bad deal for the US. North Korea has disputed this story, however, claiming that the US administration were the ones who came in with unrealistic expectations.</p><p><strong>Reactions to the failed summit have been mixed</strong>. Republican defenders of Trump claim that it was wise of the President to walk out rather than end with a bad deal, while his opponents criticised him for walking out early, and giving up on securing a better deal.</p><p>Trump has also faced criticism for <strong>his positive rhetoric about Kim Jong-Un</strong> &ndash; a dictator whose oppressive regime is infamous for countless human rights violations. This criticism was especially intense following Trump&rsquo;s remarks about <strong>Otto Warmbier</strong>, an American citizen who died from a brain injury following a stay in a North Korean prison, which most likely involved torture. Trump declared that he fully believed Kim Jong-Un&rsquo;s claim that he &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t know&rsquo; about the treatment that Warmbier had suffered in prison. Trump&rsquo;s readiness to believe the words of a dictator on this issue was strongly condemned across the political spectrum, with even some Republicans joining in the criticism.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="4c60de63-b652-443b-80e1-8d86edacf1ea">Ongoing Russia investigation</h2><p>The Russia investigation has continued into Trump&rsquo;s third year. While it was originally intended to investigate possible collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russian government, many other crimes have also been uncovered in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 27, Trump&rsquo;s former lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> was called upon to testify before Congress in a public hearing. Cohen had already been convicted for a number of crimes at that point (including tax evasion and misuse of campaign funds), and he is scheduled to spend three years in prison, though his sentence has not started yet.</p><p>During the hearing, Cohen made a series of accusation against President Donald Trump, stating that he was <strong>a racist, a liar and a conman</strong>. More specifically, Cohen claimed that Trump had directed him to lie on his behalf on many occasions, &nbsp;that Trump had told him to pay off a woman&nbsp;whom Trump had had an affair with, and that Trump had sent threatening letters to his high school and college to prevent his grades from becoming public knowledge &ndash; among other accusations. Cohen also admitted that he had previously lied to Congress in order to protect Donald Trump.</p><p>In addition to the public hearing on February 27, Cohen has also given further testimony about the potential links between Trump&rsquo;s campaign and Russia in a number of <strong>secret hearings</strong>, which are suspected to involve Cohen naming further suspects in the case within Trump&rsquo;s inner circle, who may then be subject to further investigations. &nbsp;</p><p>Reactions to Cohen&rsquo;s testimony were mixed. Democrats seized upon his statements and argued that they provided strong evidence that Trump was unfit for government, while Republicans mostly adopted the strategy of trying to discredit Cohen &ndash; pointing to the fact that he had already been convicted of lying to Congress at an earlier date, and therefore could not be trusted.</p><p>Trump himself <strong>strongly denied</strong> all of Cohen&rsquo;s allegations against him.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="91dcf696-2bca-4859-9cfe-e05e3f863caf">End of the Russia investigation</h2><p>At the end of March 2019, Robert Mueller finally released the full results of his investigation into Trump&rsquo;s campaign and Russian collusion.</p><p>Mueller&rsquo;s report showed that he had found <strong>no evidence of Russian collusion </strong>&ndash; neither in relation to Trump himself nor any of his staff. The report further stated that it was not able to make a firm conclusion about whether Trump had committed obstruction of justice during the investigation.</p><p>Trump and his supporters immediately seized upon this&nbsp;news, <strong>declaring it a huge victory</strong> and taking the opportunity of directing heavy criticism towards the mainstream media&rsquo;s obsession with the Russia investigation. Trump had repeatedly been calling the investigation a &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; and &ldquo;a hoax&rdquo;, a rhetoric which he once again took up once the conclusions were made public.</p><p>Critics of Trump had a <strong>more diverse set of responses</strong>. Some questioned Mueller&rsquo;s conclusions, and demanded that the full documentation of the investigation should be released to the public. Others looked inwards, and conceded that the liberal media might have become a bit too obsessed with covering the Russian story in particular, in their eagerness to improve ratings and discredit Trump. Still others pointed to the fact that the Russia investigations <em>did</em> reveal that many of Trump&rsquo;s officials were guilty of a range of other crimes, with some of them even going to prison&nbsp;(see above). Finally, most critics insisted that despite the conclusions of the Russia investigation, there are still a large number of <em>other</em> reasons why Trump is unfit to be President.</p><h2 id="heading-p15ru" data-guid="297b6f22-3e3c-4d69-826d-65d76514e415">Launch of reelection campaign&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>On Tuesday June 18<sup>th</sup>, Trump officially announced his reelection campaign during a rally in Orlando, Florida, setting the stage for an aggressive campaign that remains centered on the core issues that helped him get elected the first time.</p><p>His long announcement speech therefore covered familiar ground: He spoke very critically of the &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; media, the Russia investigation and his Democratic opponents. He particularly spoke against the left-wing Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying that &ldquo;<a name="seq95">Republicans do not believe in socialism, we believe in freedom</a>&rdquo;. Trump also emphasized the strength of the US economy, taking credit for its current upswing. He spoke out against illegal immigration and praised his own administration in their efforts towards building a wall on the Mexican border. He also announced that &lsquo;Keep America Great&rsquo; would be the new campaign slogan, referring to the idea that America is already on the right track and simply needs to continue in the same direction, with Trump as its President. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite Trump&rsquo;s optimism, early polls have showed that some of the main Democratic contenders currently seem to have more support than Trump.</p><h2 id="heading-r0q8u" data-guid="eeb30572-1ed9-43c3-b07f-d1a00e5c5604">Clash with Denmark over Greenland</h2><p>On August 16, 2019, a report surfaced that Trump has repeatedly talked to his staff about the idea of buying Greenland. A few days later, Trump confirmed the report and made some comments on Twitter reflecting that he thought it was an interesting idea to buy Greenland.</p><p>The news were met with ridicule and disbelief in both Greenland and Denmark, and even the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, weighed in to say that she found the idea of buying Greenland &ldquo;absurd&rdquo;, and noted that it was out of the question because Greenland was its own nation. &nbsp;</p><p>Following these comments, Trump lashed out at Mette Frederiksen on Twitter. He was scheduled to make his first diplomatic visit to Denmark on September 2, 2019, but abruptly decided to cancel the trip, citing his offense at Frederiksen&rsquo;s comment, and his disappointment that the potential purchase of Greenland could not be discussed.</p><h2 id="heading-kew8e" data-guid="63699986-650d-4bb6-95a0-7b27fba50b1a">The Ukraine scandal</h2><p>On September 18, the news media revealed that there had been a whistle-blower complaint against President Donald Trump. The whistle-blower had raised the alarm because of concerns that Trump had showed suspicious behaviour in some of his communication with Ukraine &ndash; especially in a phone call to the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, made on July 25.</p><p>The allegation against Trump is that he was trying to push Zelensky to offer incriminating information about the Biden family (some of which had previously had business connections in Ukraine), which Trump might then be able to use to attack Joe Biden before the 2020 presidential election. If these allegations are true, it would be a serious crime, so naturally there was immediately great media interest around this phone call and any other communication that might also have occurred between Trump and Ukraine.</p><p>The Trump Administration released the records of the phone call on September 25. Trump denied&nbsp;that the call contained&nbsp;anything suspicious, but critics pointed out that there are&nbsp;many passages which give the impression that Trump was pushing Zelensky for information, and he did encourage&nbsp;him to investigate the Biden family&rsquo;s history in Ukraine.</p><p>The transcript and the whistle-blower complaint contained so many details that Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, decided to start looking into impeachment procedures. This was a major turn for Pelosi, who had previously not been in support of impeachment, so many commentators speculated that there might truly be a case this time. However, it is still very unrealistic that the impeachment process can actually remove Trump from office, as it would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans. It would probably require an extremely strong case before so many Republicans would vote against their own President.</p><h2 id="heading-l1r2k" data-guid="13746cb7-0f6d-4349-be46-fc8f24af2ce0">Withdrawal from Nothern Syria</h2><p>In October 2019, Trump suddenly decided to pull out a large number of US troops from the northern border of Syria. The soldiers had been working with their Kurdish allies in the region, while also acting as a safeguard against Turkish forces, who have been known for attacks against the Kurdish minorities in both Turkey and Syria. And as expected, the US withdrawal immediately resulted in a Turkish invasion which displaced many thousand Kurdish civilians and also resulted in a number of deaths. In the longer term, it is also believed that the US withdrawal will lead to a stronger Russian influence in the area. Thus, Trump met widespread criticism for his decision, which was seen as both a betrayal of the Kurds and a golden&nbsp;opportunity for Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-at61c" data-guid="4a1ce8bd-2f53-43a7-a818-40003e4358bc">Trump is impeached by the House</h2><p>On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives (controlled by the Democrats) voted to impeach Donald Trump because of his attempts to put pressure on Ukraine to deliver information that could hurt his potential opponent Joe Biden in the 2020 election (see above). The Democrats argued that these actions undermined&nbsp;American democracy, but the Republicans were generally supportive of Trump, and argued that there was nothing incriminating about his contact&nbsp;with Ukraine. They also accused the Democrats of abusing the impeachment process because they wanted to get rid of Trump.</p><p>Once a President has been impeached by the House, the next step is a trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote is required before the President can actually be removed from office. Since the Senate is controlled by the Republicans who have so far been fiercely loyal to Trump, this currently seems very unlikely to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, it is still a shocking thing for a President to be impeached, as it has only happened three times in US history.

However, Trump tried to spin the story in a more positive light, and maintained his claims about border security being a top priority.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bill that ended the shutdown only provided temporary funding, so a new solution had to be found before February 15th. As the\u0026nbsp;deadline approached, Democrats and Republicans came together in the House and Senate to \u003cstrong\u003efinally approve a lasting funding bill\u003c/strong\u003e. The bill provided $1.375 billion\u0026nbsp;for \u0027more fencing\u0027 and other border security measures, but not nearly the $5.7 billion that Trump wanted for his border wall - yet another\u0026nbsp;political defeat for him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Trump \u003cstrong\u003eproceeded to declare a national emergency\u003c/strong\u003e, allowing him to \u003cstrong\u003ebypass Congress in order to get the money\u003c/strong\u003e needed to build his wall. This move has been heavily criticised by both Democrats and some Republicans, and it is expected that Trump will face many legal challenges because of his controversial move.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c8a7a9ce-773e-4115-9ac3-786b4c200449\u0022\u003eSecond North Korea summit\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn he final week of February, Donald Trump attended a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The summit took place in Vietnam, on neutral ground.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss \u003cstrong\u003ea possible nuclear deal with North Korea\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; ideally resulting in nuclear disarmament on the North Korean side, and in lifting of sanctions on the US side. Talks initially seemed to be going well, but then Trump abruptly decided to cut the summit short, \u003cstrong\u003ewalking away with no concrete deal on the table\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is unclear exactly what caused the talks to break down, but the Trump administration has stated that it turned out Kim Jong-Un expected all sanctions to be lifted in exchange for only partial nuclear disarmament \u0026ndash; which would have been a bad deal for the US. North Korea has disputed this story, however, claiming that the US administration were the ones who came in with unrealistic expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReactions to the failed summit have been mixed\u003c/strong\u003e. Republican defenders of Trump claim that it was wise of the President to walk out rather than end with a bad deal, while his opponents criticised him for walking out early, and giving up on securing a better deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump has also faced criticism for \u003cstrong\u003ehis positive rhetoric about Kim Jong-Un\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; a dictator whose oppressive regime is infamous for countless human rights violations. This criticism was especially intense following Trump\u0026rsquo;s remarks about \u003cstrong\u003eOtto Warmbier\u003c/strong\u003e, an American citizen who died from a brain injury following a stay in a North Korean prison, which most likely involved torture. Trump declared that he fully believed Kim Jong-Un\u0026rsquo;s claim that he \u0026lsquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rsquo; about the treatment that Warmbier had suffered in prison. Trump\u0026rsquo;s readiness to believe the words of a dictator on this issue was strongly condemned across the political spectrum, with even some Republicans joining in the criticism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00224c60de63-b652-443b-80e1-8d86edacf1ea\u0022\u003eOngoing Russia investigation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Russia investigation has continued into Trump\u0026rsquo;s third year. While it was originally intended to investigate possible collusion between Trump\u0027s campaign and the Russian government, many other crimes have also been uncovered in the process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn February 27, Trump\u0026rsquo;s former lawyer \u003cstrong\u003eMichael Cohen\u003c/strong\u003e was called upon to testify before Congress in a public hearing. Cohen had already been convicted for a number of crimes at that point (including tax evasion and misuse of campaign funds), and he is scheduled to spend three years in prison, though his sentence has not started yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the hearing, Cohen made a series of accusation against President Donald Trump, stating that he was \u003cstrong\u003ea racist, a liar and a conman\u003c/strong\u003e. More specifically, Cohen claimed that Trump had directed him to lie on his behalf on many occasions, \u0026nbsp;that Trump had told him to pay off a woman\u0026nbsp;whom Trump had had an affair with, and that Trump had sent threatening letters to his high school and college to prevent his grades from becoming public knowledge \u0026ndash; among other accusations. Cohen also admitted that he had previously lied to Congress in order to protect Donald Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the public hearing on February 27, Cohen has also given further testimony about the potential links between Trump\u0026rsquo;s campaign and Russia in a number of \u003cstrong\u003esecret hearings\u003c/strong\u003e, which are suspected to involve Cohen naming further suspects in the case within Trump\u0026rsquo;s inner circle, who may then be subject to further investigations. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReactions to Cohen\u0026rsquo;s testimony were mixed. Democrats seized upon his statements and argued that they provided strong evidence that Trump was unfit for government, while Republicans mostly adopted the strategy of trying to discredit Cohen \u0026ndash; pointing to the fact that he had already been convicted of lying to Congress at an earlier date, and therefore could not be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump himself \u003cstrong\u003estrongly denied\u003c/strong\u003e all of Cohen\u0026rsquo;s allegations against him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u002291dcf696-2bca-4859-9cfe-e05e3f863caf\u0022\u003eEnd of the Russia investigation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of March 2019, Robert Mueller finally released the full results of his investigation into Trump\u0026rsquo;s campaign and Russian collusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller\u0026rsquo;s report showed that he had found \u003cstrong\u003eno evidence of Russian collusion \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026ndash; neither in relation to Trump himself nor any of his staff. The report further stated that it was not able to make a firm conclusion about whether Trump had committed obstruction of justice during the investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump and his supporters immediately seized upon this\u0026nbsp;news, \u003cstrong\u003edeclaring it a huge victory\u003c/strong\u003e and taking the opportunity of directing heavy criticism towards the mainstream media\u0026rsquo;s obsession with the Russia investigation. Trump had repeatedly been calling the investigation a \u0026ldquo;witch hunt\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;a hoax\u0026rdquo;, a rhetoric which he once again took up once the conclusions were made public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCritics of Trump had a \u003cstrong\u003emore diverse set of responses\u003c/strong\u003e. Some questioned Mueller\u0026rsquo;s conclusions, and demanded that the full documentation of the investigation should be released to the public. Others looked inwards, and conceded that the liberal media might have become a bit too obsessed with covering the Russian story in particular, in their eagerness to improve ratings and discredit Trump. Still others pointed to the fact that the Russia investigations \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e reveal that many of Trump\u0026rsquo;s officials were guilty of a range of other crimes, with some of them even going to prison\u0026nbsp;(see above). Finally, most critics insisted that despite the conclusions of the Russia investigation, there are still a large number of \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e reasons why Trump is unfit to be President.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-p15ru\u0022 data-guid=\u0022297b6f22-3e3c-4d69-826d-65d76514e415\u0022\u003eLaunch of reelection campaign\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday June 18\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e, Trump officially announced his reelection campaign during a rally in Orlando, Florida, setting the stage for an aggressive campaign that remains centered on the core issues that helped him get elected the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis long announcement speech therefore covered familiar ground: He spoke very critically of the \u0026lsquo;fake news\u0026rsquo; media, the Russia investigation and his Democratic opponents. He particularly spoke against the left-wing Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying that \u0026ldquo;\u003ca name=\u0022seq95\u0022\u003eRepublicans do not believe in socialism, we believe in freedom\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;. Trump also emphasized the strength of the US economy, taking credit for its current upswing. He spoke out against illegal immigration and praised his own administration in their efforts towards building a wall on the Mexican border. He also announced that \u0026lsquo;Keep America Great\u0026rsquo; would be the new campaign slogan, referring to the idea that America is already on the right track and simply needs to continue in the same direction, with Trump as its President. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite Trump\u0026rsquo;s optimism, early polls have showed that some of the main Democratic contenders currently seem to have more support than Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-r0q8u\u0022 data-guid=\u0022eeb30572-1ed9-43c3-b07f-d1a00e5c5604\u0022\u003eClash with Denmark over Greenland\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn August 16, 2019, a report surfaced that Trump has repeatedly talked to his staff about the idea of buying Greenland. A few days later, Trump confirmed the report and made some comments on Twitter reflecting that he thought it was an interesting idea to buy Greenland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe news were met with ridicule and disbelief in both Greenland and Denmark, and even the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, weighed in to say that she found the idea of buying Greenland \u0026ldquo;absurd\u0026rdquo;, and noted that it was out of the question because Greenland was its own nation. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing these comments, Trump lashed out at Mette Frederiksen on Twitter. He was scheduled to make his first diplomatic visit to Denmark on September 2, 2019, but abruptly decided to cancel the trip, citing his offense at Frederiksen\u0026rsquo;s comment, and his disappointment that the potential purchase of Greenland could not be discussed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-kew8e\u0022 data-guid=\u002263699986-650d-4bb6-95a0-7b27fba50b1a\u0022\u003eThe Ukraine scandal\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn September 18, the news media revealed that there had been a whistle-blower complaint against President Donald Trump. The whistle-blower had raised the alarm because of concerns that Trump had showed suspicious behaviour in some of his communication with Ukraine \u0026ndash; especially in a phone call to the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, made on July 25.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe allegation against Trump is that he was trying to push Zelensky to offer incriminating information about the Biden family (some of which had previously had business connections in Ukraine), which Trump might then be able to use to attack Joe Biden before the 2020 presidential election. If these allegations are true, it would be a serious crime, so naturally there was immediately great media interest around this phone call and any other communication that might also have occurred between Trump and Ukraine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Trump Administration released the records of the phone call on September 25. Trump denied\u0026nbsp;that the call contained\u0026nbsp;anything suspicious, but critics pointed out that there are\u0026nbsp;many passages which give the impression that Trump was pushing Zelensky for information, and he did encourage\u0026nbsp;him to investigate the Biden family\u0026rsquo;s history in Ukraine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe transcript and the whistle-blower complaint contained so many details that Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, decided to start looking into impeachment procedures. This was a major turn for Pelosi, who had previously not been in support of impeachment, so many commentators speculated that there might truly be a case this time. However, it is still very unrealistic that the impeachment process can actually remove Trump from office, as it would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans. It would probably require an extremely strong case before so many Republicans would vote against their own President.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-l1r2k\u0022 data-guid=\u002213746cb7-0f6d-4349-be46-fc8f24af2ce0\u0022\u003eWithdrawal from Nothern Syria\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn October 2019, Trump suddenly decided to pull out a large number of US troops from the northern border of Syria. The soldiers had been working with their Kurdish allies in the region, while also acting as a safeguard against Turkish forces, who have been known for attacks against the Kurdish minorities in both Turkey and Syria. And as expected, the US withdrawal immediately resulted in a Turkish invasion which displaced many thousand Kurdish civilians and also resulted in a number of deaths. In the longer term, it is also believed that the US withdrawal will lead to a stronger Russian influence in the area. Thus, Trump met widespread criticism for his decision, which was seen as both a betrayal of the Kurds and a golden\u0026nbsp;opportunity for Vladimir Putin.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-at61c\u0022 data-guid=\u00224a1ce8bd-2f53-43a7-a818-40003e4358bc\u0022\u003eTrump is impeached by the House\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives (controlled by the Democrats) voted to impeach Donald Trump because of his attempts to put pressure on Ukraine to deliver information that could hurt his potential opponent Joe Biden in the 2020 election (see above). The Democrats argued that these actions undermined\u0026nbsp;American democracy, but the Republicans were generally supportive of Trump, and argued that there was nothing incriminating about his contact\u0026nbsp;with Ukraine. They also accused the Democrats of abusing the impeachment process because they wanted to get rid of Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce a President has been impeached by the House, the next step is a trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote is required before the President can actually be removed from office. Since the Senate is controlled by the Republicans who have so far been fiercely loyal to Trump, this currently seems very unlikely to happen.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven so, it is still a shocking thing for a President to be impeached, as it has only happened three times in US history. No President has ever actually been removed from office because of impeachment, however, as it is very difficult to achieve the Senate majority required.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The third year of Donald Trump\u0027s presidency (2019-2020)","MetaDescription":"On January 25th, 2019, Donald Trump signed a bill to end the government shutdown that began in late 2018 because of disagreement about border security funding.
