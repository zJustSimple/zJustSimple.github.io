In 1847 a woman was looked upon as the property of the man. She could not vote, she could not choose her own husband, and all other sorts of things, that we as women take for granted nowadays &ndash; things that at that time were completely unthinkable are obvious rights today. How can you see the meaning in your life if you don&rsquo;t have any influence on it?</p><p>&lsquo;From childhood to independence&rsquo; is one of the main themes in the novel Jane Eyre. As a child Jane grew up as an orphan so she had to live with her aunt and her two cousins. Her aunt had no love left for Jane and Jane was therefore sent away to a charity school for young girls - Lowood. This school had a very harsh regime and Jane experienced loneliness. Jane&rsquo;s only friend, Hellen Burns, died while she was still a young schoolgirl, and once again Jane was left alone.<br>&ldquo;My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age &ndash; and not the golden age either: it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse that the physical hardships of my lot &ndash; though these were no trifles&rdquo;. (p. 59)&nbsp;<br>The troubled childhood and school years strengthened Jane&rsquo;s natural independence and spirit.</p><p>Her schooldays, although she felt lonely, proved to be an important element in her path towards independence. &ldquo;During these eight years my life was uniform, but not unhappy, because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; &ldquo; (p. 83).<br>Thus, Jane&rsquo;s childhood and school years gave her strength and resulted in independence &ndash; and these elements were necessary when she found a position as governess at Thornfield Hall.</p><p>&lsquo;Love&rsquo; and &lsquo;romance&rsquo; are two other important themes in Jane Eyre. At Thornfield Hall Jane meets the enigmatic Mr Rochester. Although Mr Rochester almost always is away Jane falls in love with him. However, her love for him is at first difficult for Jane to accept because they belong to two different social classes. Mr. Rochester is the rich one, is free as the bird and therefore he has the opportunity to go to a lot of parties, to travel a lot and to do whatever he likes. Jane, on the other hand, is employed by him and is therefore subjected to his will and orders. &nbsp;</p><p>Even though Jane is aware of her lower, social status she retains her dignity in her relationship with Mr Rochester. This becomes clear in the scene where Jane is intending to leave Thornfield Hall because she believes that he is going to get married: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform&rdquo; (p. 223).&nbsp;</p><p>This conversation between the two is also interesting, because it deals with the fact that Jane is in love with Mr Rochester and at the same time uncertain about his feelings towards her. He is enigmatic in his behaviour towards her. At this time we know that Jane and Mr Rochester are attracted to each other, but Jane dares not believe that he might love her the way she loves him. However, Mr Rochester is testing Jane to see how much she really cares for him. He could easily tell her that he has no intention of marrying Blanche, but he chooses to let Jane remain in the belief that Blanche is his future wife. Later in the novel Jane and Mr Rochester, however, declare their love for each other and they get married.&nbsp;</p><p>In the conclusion of the novel, Jane looks back on her years of marriage. &ldquo;I have now been married for ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blessed &ndash; blessed beyond what language can express &ndash; because I am my husband&rsquo;s life as fully as he is mine.&rdquo; (p. 447) And she continues her reflections on her love for her husband. &ldquo;All my confidence is bestowed on him; all his confidence is devoted to me &ndash; we are precisely suited in character; perfect concord is the result&rdquo; (ibid). To sum up their happy marriage proves that love is stronger than class which was not common in the 19th century. &nbsp;</p><p>But how is it possible that a novel from 1847 still appeals to its readers after more than 150 years? One possible answer is that the main characters, the heroine Jane and her husband Mr Rochester, are highly believable because they are intelligent, emotional human beings &ndash; with flaws &ndash; and this makes them convincing characters in the novel. Both the 19th-centry reader and the reader of today find that Jane&rsquo;s life, especially her intense and inner life, is a true picture of a woman both of her time and even of today.</p><p>The female portraits in Jane Eyre show the contrast between the new, emerging female role as apposed to the more traditional female role, where women had to obey the rules defined by authorities, by fathers and husbands. &nbsp;However, Jane challenges the norms of her time. She pursues her goals and defends her attitudes in life by marrying out of love while at the same time she disregards the rules of marrying within one&rsquo;s own class. By marrying Mr Rochester Jane becomes complete. This could only happen because of Jane&rsquo;s courage and self-confidence. These two elements are important in the history of women and strong, determined women were the frontrunners who led to women&rsquo;s independence around the turn of the 20th century.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/charlotte-bronte/jane-eyre/summary" title="Summary of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a></div></div></div></div>

In 1847 a woman was looked upon as the property of the man. She could not vote, she could not choose her own husband, and all other sorts of things, that we as women take for granted nowadays \u0026ndash; things that at that time were completely unthinkable are obvious rights today. How can you see the meaning in your life if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any influence on it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;From childhood to independence\u0026rsquo; is one of the main themes in the novel Jane Eyre. As a child Jane grew up as an orphan so she had to live with her aunt and her two cousins. Her aunt had no love left for Jane and Jane was therefore sent away to a charity school for young girls - Lowood. This school had a very harsh regime and Jane experienced loneliness. Jane\u0026rsquo;s only friend, Hellen Burns, died while she was still a young schoolgirl, and once again Jane was left alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026ldquo;My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age \u0026ndash; and not the golden age either: it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse that the physical hardships of my lot \u0026ndash; though these were no trifles\u0026rdquo;. (p. 59)\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eThe troubled childhood and school years strengthened Jane\u0026rsquo;s natural independence and spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer schooldays, although she felt lonely, proved to be an important element in her path towards independence. \u0026ldquo;During these eight years my life was uniform, but not unhappy, because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; \u0026ldquo; (p. 83).\u003cbr\u003eThus, Jane\u0026rsquo;s childhood and school years gave her strength and resulted in independence \u0026ndash; and these elements were necessary when she found a position as governess at Thornfield Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Love\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;romance\u0026rsquo; are two other important themes in Jane Eyre. At Thornfield Hall Jane meets the enigmatic Mr Rochester. Although Mr Rochester almost always is away Jane falls in love with him. However, her love for him is at first difficult for Jane to accept because they belong to two different social classes. Mr. Rochester is the rich one, is free as the bird and therefore he has the opportunity to go to a lot of parties, to travel a lot and to do whatever he likes. Jane, on the other hand, is employed by him and is therefore subjected to his will and orders. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though Jane is aware of her lower, social status she retains her dignity in her relationship with Mr Rochester. This becomes clear in the scene where Jane is intending to leave Thornfield Hall because she believes that he is going to get married: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform\u0026rdquo; (p. 223).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis conversation between the two is also interesting, because it deals with the fact that Jane is in love with Mr Rochester and at the same time uncertain about his feelings towards her. He is enigmatic in his behaviour towards her. At this time we know that Jane and Mr Rochester are attracted to each other, but Jane dares not believe that he might love her the way she loves him. However, Mr Rochester is testing Jane to see how much she really cares for him. He could easily tell her that he has no intention of marrying Blanche, but he chooses to let Jane remain in the belief that Blanche is his future wife. Later in the novel Jane and Mr Rochester, however, declare their love for each other and they get married.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the conclusion of the novel, Jane looks back on her years of marriage. \u0026ldquo;I have now been married for ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blessed \u0026ndash; blessed beyond what language can express \u0026ndash; because I am my husband\u0026rsquo;s life as fully as he is mine.\u0026rdquo; (p. 447) And she continues her reflections on her love for her husband. \u0026ldquo;All my confidence is bestowed on him; all his confidence is devoted to me \u0026ndash; we are precisely suited in character; perfect concord is the result\u0026rdquo; (ibid). To sum up their happy marriage proves that love is stronger than class which was not common in the 19th century. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut how is it possible that a novel from 1847 still appeals to its readers after more than 150 years? One possible answer is that the main characters, the heroine Jane and her husband Mr Rochester, are highly believable because they are intelligent, emotional human beings \u0026ndash; with flaws \u0026ndash; and this makes them convincing characters in the novel. Both the 19th-centry reader and the reader of today find that Jane\u0026rsquo;s life, especially her intense and inner life, is a true picture of a woman both of her time and even of today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe female portraits in Jane Eyre show the contrast between the new, emerging female role as apposed to the more traditional female role, where women had to obey the rules defined by authorities, by fathers and husbands. \u0026nbsp;However, Jane challenges the norms of her time. She pursues her goals and defends her attitudes in life by marrying out of love while at the same time she disregards the rules of marrying within one\u0026rsquo;s own class. By marrying Mr Rochester Jane becomes complete. This could only happen because of Jane\u0026rsquo;s courage and self-confidence. These two elements are important in the history of women and strong, determined women were the frontrunners who led to women\u0026rsquo;s independence around the turn of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Jane Eyre de Charlotte Bronte | Characterization (Caracterizare)","MetaDescription":"What makes a woman complete?
