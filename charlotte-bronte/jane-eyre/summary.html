Jane is mistreated by her aunt and three cousins, who see her as a dependent, and not family. After being punished for a fight her cousin John started, Jane is locked in the room where her uncle Reed died. Terrified because she believes she sees his ghost, she begs to be let free and eventually faints of fear.&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs Reed decides to send Jane away to a boarding school, Lowood Institute. At Lowood, Jane lives in harsh conditions but befriends a girl called Helen Burns, who teaches Jane how to trust in God and endure hardships. Jane also takes to the kind <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>The person in charge of an organization.</p>">superintendent</span>, Miss Temple. The terrible conditions at Lowood cause disease to break out and half the students, including Helen, die. Afterwards, Brocklehurst, the manager of Lowood, who enforced the harsh conditions as a means to teach the students humility, is replaced and the school improves. Jane graduates and works as a teacher at the school for two years.&nbsp;</p><p>After Miss Temple leaves Lowood, Jane wishes to leave too and advertises for the position of private governess. She is hired to teach ten-year-old Adèle at Thornfield. There Jane meets Rochester, the master of Thornfield, who took Adèle in as his ward after her mother, who was Rochester&rsquo;s mistress, had abandoned her.&nbsp;</p><p>Strange things sometimes happen at Thornfield. Jane often hears maniacal laughter coming from the third floor, and someone sets Rochester&rsquo;s bed curtains on fire in the middle of the night. Jane saves Rochester&rsquo;s life, and he blames a servant, Grace Poole, for the incident, but Grace is not fired or punished.</p><p>Jane does not see Rochester after the incident, as he leaves for a party at a nearby estate for several days. She starts missing him and realizes she has feelings for him. When Rochester returns to Thornfield, he brings the party of guests with him, including the beautiful Blanche Ingram, who seems to be romantically pursuing Rochester.&nbsp;</p><p>One night, an acquaintance of Rochester&rsquo;s, Mr Mason, arrives at Thornfield, which unsettles Rochester. Jane finds out Mason and Rochester both lived in Jamaica. That night, Mason is attacked and Jane has to tend to his wounds while Rochester fetches a doctor, but Rochester forbids them from talking until he returns. Jane guesses it must have been Grace Poole who attacked Mason, as the incident took place on the third floor where Grace lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Jane leaves Thornfield for a month to visit Mrs Reed, who is dying and asked to see Jane. Jane attempts to fix their relationship, but her aunt refuses. Mrs Reed reveals Jane has another living relative, John Eyre, who wished to adopt Jane and leave her his fortune, but Mrs Reed had told him Jane was dead.&nbsp;<br>Returning to Thornfield after Mrs Reed dies, Jane is excited to see Rochester again but dreads his upcoming marriage to Blanche Ingram. One day, Rochester reveals to Jane that he has no plans to marry Blanche and was only trying to make Jane jealous. Jane admits his feelings for him, and Rochester proposes.&nbsp;</p><p>A few days before the wedding, Jane is woken up by a strange woman in her room who tears up her wedding veil and tramples it, causing Jane to faint from fear. Rochester tells Jane the woman must have been Grace Poole and promises to explain everything later. On the day of their wedding, Rochester rushes Jane to the chapel, where two people interrupt the wedding, saying Rochester is already married, and his wife lives at Thornfield. One of the people is Mr Mason, who claims Rochester&rsquo;s wife is his sister, Bertha.&nbsp;</p><p>Rochester is enraged but does not deny the accusations. He takes everyone to the third floor of Thornfield where he shows them Bertha, a strange and disheveled woman who attacks Rochester and her keeper, Grace Poole. Rochester says that Bertha is insane, and he was tricked into marrying her by her family, who kept her mental state a secret until after the marriage. Jane realizes she does not wish to be Rochester&rsquo;s mistress and leaves Thornfield in the night.&nbsp;</p><p>Jane spends three days in a small town far away from Thornfield, begging for food and employment and sleeping outside. Eventually, a clergyman named St John Rivers lets Jane into his house, where he and his sisters, Diana and Mary, take care of Jane while she recovers. Jane grows close to the two sisters, and St John offers Jane a job as a school teacher for the poor girls in the village.<br>One day, St John tells Jane that he has discovered that she inherited a large sum of money from her uncle, John Eyre, who passed away. He reveals that he knows this because John Eyre is also his uncle, so St John, Diana, and Mary are Jane&rsquo;s cousins. Jane decides to split the money evenly between the four of them.&nbsp;</p><p>St John plans to become a <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>&amp;nbsp;A person who has been sent to a foreign country to teach their religion to the people who live there.</p>">missionary </span>in India and asks Jane to accompany him as his wife. Jane says she will accompany him but not marry him because they do not love each other as husband and wife. St John continues to try to convince Jane and almost succeeds, but then Jane hears Rochester&rsquo;s voice calling out to her. She decides to return to Thornfield and try and find him.&nbsp;</p><p>Jane leaves for Thornfield the next day but finds the manor a burned-down ruin. An innkeeper tells her Bertha burned the house down one night and then killed herself by jumping from the roof. Rochester lost his sight and one hand in the incident, and retreated to his smaller house in Ferndean. Jane then goes to Ferndean, where she finds Rochester looking depressed. He is overjoyed at her arrival, and she promises to never leave him again. Jane and Rochester marry.&nbsp;<br>Jane tells of her past ten years of married bliss. She recounts that Adèle is at a boarding school near Ferndean, Diana and Mary are happily married, and St John works as a missionary in India but is nearing death. Rochester&rsquo;s sight had partially returned, and he and Jane have a son together.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="rezumat.html" title="Jane Eyre de Charlotte Bronte | Rezumat" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span></a><a href="characterization-caracterizare.html" title="Jane Eyre de Charlotte Bronte | Characterization (Caracterizare)" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Characterization (Caracterizare)</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Jane is mistreated by her aunt and three cousins, who see her as a dependent, and not family. After being punished for a fight her cousin John started, Jane is locked in the room where her uncle Reed died. Terrified because she believes she sees his ghost, she begs to be let free and eventually faints of fear.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMrs Reed decides to send Jane away to a boarding school, Lowood Institute. At Lowood, Jane lives in harsh conditions but befriends a girl called Helen Burns, who teaches Jane how to trust in God and endure hardships.

The terrible conditions at Lowood cause disease to break out and half the students, including Helen, die.

Jane graduates and works as a teacher at the school for two years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Miss Temple leaves Lowood, Jane wishes to leave too and advertises for the position of private governess. She is hired to teach ten-year-old Adèle at Thornfield. There Jane meets Rochester, the master of Thornfield, who took Adèle in as his ward after her mother, who was Rochester\u0026rsquo;s mistress, had abandoned her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrange things sometimes happen at Thornfield. Jane often hears maniacal laughter coming from the third floor, and someone sets Rochester\u0026rsquo;s bed curtains on fire in the middle of the night. Jane saves Rochester\u0026rsquo;s life, and he blames a servant, Grace Poole, for the incident, but Grace is not fired or punished.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane does not see Rochester after the incident, as he leaves for a party at a nearby estate for several days. She starts missing him and realizes she has feelings for him. When Rochester returns to Thornfield, he brings the party of guests with him, including the beautiful Blanche Ingram, who seems to be romantically pursuing Rochester.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne night, an acquaintance of Rochester\u0026rsquo;s, Mr Mason, arrives at Thornfield, which unsettles Rochester. Jane finds out Mason and Rochester both lived in Jamaica. That night, Mason is attacked and Jane has to tend to his wounds while Rochester fetches a doctor, but Rochester forbids them from talking until he returns. Jane guesses it must have been Grace Poole who attacked Mason, as the incident took place on the third floor where Grace lives.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane leaves Thornfield for a month to visit Mrs Reed, who is dying and asked to see Jane. Jane attempts to fix their relationship, but her aunt refuses. Mrs Reed reveals Jane has another living relative, John Eyre, who wished to adopt Jane and leave her his fortune, but Mrs Reed had told him Jane was dead.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eReturning to Thornfield after Mrs Reed dies, Jane is excited to see Rochester again but dreads his upcoming marriage to Blanche Ingram. One day, Rochester reveals to Jane that he has no plans to marry Blanche and was only trying to make Jane jealous. Jane admits his feelings for him, and Rochester proposes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few days before the wedding, Jane is woken up by a strange woman in her room who tears up her wedding veil and tramples it, causing Jane to faint from fear. Rochester tells Jane the woman must have been Grace Poole and promises to explain everything later. On the day of their wedding, Rochester rushes Jane to the chapel, where two people interrupt the wedding, saying Rochester is already married, and his wife lives at Thornfield. One of the people is Mr Mason, who claims Rochester\u0026rsquo;s wife is his sister, Bertha.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRochester is enraged but does not deny the accusations. He takes everyone to the third floor of Thornfield where he shows them Bertha, a strange and disheveled woman who attacks Rochester and her keeper, Grace Poole. Rochester says that Bertha is insane, and he was tricked into marrying her by her family, who kept her mental state a secret until after the marriage. Jane realizes she does not wish to be Rochester\u0026rsquo;s mistress and leaves Thornfield in the night.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane spends three days in a small town far away from Thornfield, begging for food and employment and sleeping outside. Eventually, a clergyman named St John Rivers lets Jane into his house, where he and his sisters, Diana and Mary, take care of Jane while she recovers. Jane grows close to the two sisters, and St John offers Jane a job as a school teacher for the poor girls in the village.\u003cbr\u003eOne day, St John tells Jane that he has discovered that she inherited a large sum of money from her uncle, John Eyre, who passed away. He reveals that he knows this because John Eyre is also his uncle, so St John, Diana, and Mary are Jane\u0026rsquo;s cousins.
