D. Salinger&rsquo;s novel <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. He is an American seventeen-year-old boy who recounts the events that occurred a few days before Christmas the previous year when he was sixteen.&nbsp;</p><p>Holden&rsquo;s family lives in New York City and, at the time he narrates the story, he is currently living in an institution in California. Before, Holden was a student at Pencey Prep, where he was expelled because he failed all his subjects except English. Holden has abandoned or been kicked out of several other schools because he felt depressed by the fake attitude of the headmaster and by the <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Fake, insincere, pretending to be something you are not.</p>">phony</span> students.&nbsp;</p><p>Holden has an older brother, D. B., a younger sister, Phoebe, and a younger brother, Allie, who died of leukemia when Holden was thirteen. Holden has a close relationship with Phoebe and cherishes Allie&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp;</p><p>Physically, the element that makes Holden stand out in the novel is his red hunting hat, which he got from New York:</p><blockquote><p>It was this red hunting hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway (&hellip;) It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back &ndash; very corny, I&rsquo;ll admit, but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way. (pp. 18-19)</p></blockquote><p>The red hunting hat appears several times throughout the novel and becomes a symbol of Holden&rsquo;s uniqueness and quirkiness.&nbsp;</p><p>Holden reveals that he is &ldquo;six foot two and a half&rdquo; (p. 9) and that he has &ldquo;millions of gray hairs&rdquo; (p. 9) on the right side of his head. In several contexts, Holden uses his gray hair as an excuse to appear older and to trick people into thinking that he is more mature than he looks.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-y1ynh" title="ID: heading-y1ynh" data-guid="d8e6a574-7ead-469f-b94d-336434ed424a">Inner characterization</h2><h3 title="ID: heading-m6y2p" id="heading-8n7gy">Holden yearns for companionship but is unable to form meaningful connections</h3><p>Holden&rsquo;s story presents a series of his failed attempts to connect with the people around him. This comes from both <strong>a tendency to isolate himself from others</strong> and a deliberate <strong>rejection of those who might want to form a connection</strong> with him. He is lonely and, despite having a superior attitude, he feels the need to connect with other people. For example, he reaches out to different people throughout the novel, expressing his need for connection, but he is unable to fully commit and ends up rejecting the people he needs.</p><p>He reaches out to former friends, Sally Hayes and Carl Luce, when he is in New York, but he ends up rejecting Sally and pushing Luce away. Holden also pushes his family away by refusing to tell his parents that he was expelled, and rejects some of his colleagues at Pencey because he feels superior to them. In the end, Holden&rsquo;s alienation is his worst enemy, as it makes him reach out to people then push them away, remaining lonely.</p><p>One of the reasons why Holden fails to connect with people is that he is <strong>judgmental of the people whom he considers &ldquo;phonies&rdquo;</strong>. He mainly judges his own generation &ndash; &ldquo;prep school jerks and college jerks&rdquo; (p. 91) &ndash; particularly the students at Pencey and his former schools: &ldquo;One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies&rdquo; (p. 14). For Holden, being a phony means being fake, arrogant, and superficial.&nbsp;</p><p>Holden particularly criticizes Sally Hayes, calling her &ldquo;the queen of the phonies&rdquo; (p. 126) because of her superficiality and desire to appear perfect. Despite this, he is able to overlook Sally&rsquo;s personality, which he finds annoying and loud, because she looks extremely attractive:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>She looked terrific. She really did. (&hellip;) I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I&rsquo;m crazy. I didn&rsquo;t even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. (p. 132)</p></blockquote><p>Holden indeed tells Sally he loves her and asks her to run away with him. This highlights his <strong>contradictory nature</strong> and the fact that though he hates superficiality, he can also be rather superficial himself at times.</p><h3 id="heading-kblwa" title="ID: heading-kblwa">Holden is fearful and frustrated with sexuality</h3><p>One of the issues that disturb Holden the most is his sexuality. Before meeting Sunny, the prostitute, Holden claims that he is a virgin but that he was close to having sex several times:</p><blockquote><p>Something always happens. For instance, if you&rsquo;re at a girl&rsquo;s house, her parents always come home at the wrong time &ndash; or you&rsquo;re afraid they will. Or if you&rsquo;re in the back seat of somebody&rsquo;s car, there&rsquo;s always somebody&rsquo;s date in the front seat &ndash; some girl, I mean &ndash; that always wants to know what&rsquo;s going on all over the whole goddam car. (p. 100)</p></blockquote><p>Holden&rsquo;s <strong>failed sexual experiences</strong> are also strongly connected with instances of sexual abuse: &ldquo;The thing is, most of the time when you&rsquo;re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl (&hellip;) she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t help it&rdquo; (p. 100). When he talks about Jane Gallagher, he even expresses his fear that Jane could have been sexually molested by her step-father.&nbsp;</p><p>Holden&rsquo;s inability to continue his sexual advances toward girls shows that he is afraid of coming across as abusive and pushy. This might suggest that he has a more <strong>mature and respectful</strong> attitude towards sex than his peers, such as Stradlater, who he gives as an example of boys who are pushy and convince girls to have sex with them. He also feels that girls are either &ldquo;scared as hell&rdquo; (p. 100) or that they refuse to have sex because they feel refusing is the right thing to do. In this way, his failed sexual experiences create frustration, which Holden is unable to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>Holden is quite <strong>flirty and sexually suggestive</strong> with most of the other girls and women in the novel, including Sally and the three women at the Lavender Room. What is more, when he witnesses the scene with the couple spitting water in each other&rsquo;s faces, Holden feels sexually aroused. He feels that &ldquo;that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch, even if you don&rsquo;t want it to be&rdquo; (p. 67), which shows that he is somehow bothered that he is aroused by the behavior he dislikes.&nbsp;</p><p>When he meets Sunny, the prostitute, Holden feels &ldquo;pretty sexy and all&rdquo; (p. 100) but, as she takes off her dress, he starts feeling &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; (p. 103). This moment, along with Holden&rsquo;s need for a personal connection with Sunny, shows that he is not ready to take this big step. This suggests that Holden is <strong>only interested in the idea of sex</strong>.</p><h3 id="heading-7qzss" title="ID: heading-7qzss">Holden is concerned with preserving innocence</h3><p>Although he is interested in sex and quite persistent to learn more about the topic in his conversation with Carl Luce, Holden is mainly <strong>preoccupied with preserving innocence</strong>. For him, the icons of innocence are his late brother, Allie, his sister, Phoebe, and all the children he comes across in New York.</p><p>Holden is protective of children and observant of their needs. For example, when he notices that a skinny child has trouble balancing on the seesaw, he tries to help (p. 132). When one of his sister&rsquo;s friends needs help with her skates, Holden jumps to the occasion and helps her (p. 129). This shows that he instinctively notices instances of injustice and tries to adopt <strong>the role of protector</strong>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody&rsquo;s around &ndash; nobody big, I mean &ndash; except me. And I&rsquo;m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff &ndash; I mean if they&rsquo;re running and they don&rsquo;t look where they&rsquo;re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them (&hellip;) I&rsquo;d just be the catcher in the rye and all. (p. 186)</p></blockquote><p>This episode shows that Holden is caught between childhood and adulthood. He wants to preserve childhood innocence &ndash; both in himself and in others &ndash; and he is <strong>not yet ready to embrace the responsibilities of adulthood</strong>.</p><h3 id="heading-xi0uq" title="ID: heading-xi0uq">Holden is traumatized and troubled</h3><p>Holden is <strong>deeply affected by the death of his younger brother</strong>, Allie, whom he saw as an innocent and perfect child. Holden speaks to Allie when he is depressed, either offering to make amends for the times when he thinks he has wronged Allie or asking him for help: &ldquo;Boy, I felt miserable. I felt so depressed, you can&rsquo;t imagine. What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed&rdquo; (p. 107). He also dislikes going to the cemetery where Allie is buried and imagining his body in the ground. This all suggests that Holden is unable to come to terms with Allie&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, Holden is <strong>depressed</strong> and unable to find joy in anything around him. When Phoebe asks him to name one thing he likes, Holden is only able to think of Allie:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;I like Allie,&rsquo; I said. (&hellip;)<br>&lsquo;Allie&rsquo;s dead &ndash; You always say that! If somebody&rsquo;s dead and everything, and in Heaven, then it isn&rsquo;t really &ndash;&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;I know he&rsquo;s dead! Don&rsquo;t you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can&rsquo;t I? Just because somebody&rsquo;s dead, you don&rsquo;t just stop liking them, for God&rsquo;s sake &ndash; especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that&rsquo;re alive and all.&rsquo; (p. 178)</p></blockquote><p>Holden&rsquo;s mental state and grief from losing his brother leave him wishing to avoid his reality, entertaining fantasies of running away, and unable to accept the passage of time.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/jerome-david-salinger/de-veghe-in-lanul-de-secara/summary" title="The Catcher in the Rye | Summary" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a><a href="/jerome-david-salinger/de-veghe-in-lanul-de-secara/analysis-of-the-catcher-in-the-rye" title="Analysis of The Catcher in the Rye" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Analysis of The Catcher in the Rye</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

D. Salinger\u0026rsquo;s novel \u003ci\u003eThe Catcher in the Rye\u003c/i\u003e. He is an American seventeen-year-old boy who recounts the events that occurred a few days before Christmas the previous year when he was sixteen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0026rsquo;s family lives in New York City and, at the time he narrates the story, he is currently living in an institution in California. Before, Holden was a student at Pencey Prep, where he was expelled because he failed all his subjects except English. Holden has abandoned or been kicked out of several other schools because he felt depressed by the fake attitude of the headmaster and by the \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eFake, insincere, pretending to be something you are not.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003ephony\u003c/span\u003e students.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden has an older brother, D. B., a younger sister, Phoebe, and a younger brother, Allie, who died of leukemia when Holden was thirteen. Holden has a close relationship with Phoebe and cherishes Allie\u0026rsquo;s memory.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhysically, the element that makes Holden stand out in the novel is his red hunting hat, which he got from New York:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was this red hunting hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway (\u0026hellip;) It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back \u0026ndash; very corny, I\u0026rsquo;ll admit, but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way. (pp. 18-19)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe red hunting hat appears several times throughout the novel and becomes a symbol of Holden\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness and quirkiness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden reveals that he is \u0026ldquo;six foot two and a half\u0026rdquo; (p. 9) and that he has \u0026ldquo;millions of gray hairs\u0026rdquo; (p. 9) on the right side of his head. In several contexts, Holden uses his gray hair as an excuse to appear older and to trick people into thinking that he is more mature than he looks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-y1ynh\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-y1ynh\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d8e6a574-7ead-469f-b94d-336434ed424a\u0022\u003eInner characterization\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 title=\u0022ID: heading-m6y2p\u0022 id=\u0022heading-8n7gy\u0022\u003eHolden yearns for companionship but is unable to form meaningful connections\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0026rsquo;s story presents a series of his failed attempts to connect with the people around him. This comes from both \u003cstrong\u003ea tendency to isolate himself from others\u003c/strong\u003e and a deliberate \u003cstrong\u003erejection of those who might want to form a connection\u003c/strong\u003e with him. He is lonely and, despite having a superior attitude, he feels the need to connect with other people. For example, he reaches out to different people throughout the novel, expressing his need for connection, but he is unable to fully commit and ends up rejecting the people he needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe reaches out to former friends, Sally Hayes and Carl Luce, when he is in New York, but he ends up rejecting Sally and pushing Luce away. Holden also pushes his family away by refusing to tell his parents that he was expelled, and rejects some of his colleagues at Pencey because he feels superior to them. In the end, Holden\u0026rsquo;s alienation is his worst enemy, as it makes him reach out to people then push them away, remaining lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons why Holden fails to connect with people is that he is \u003cstrong\u003ejudgmental of the people whom he considers \u0026ldquo;phonies\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e. He mainly judges his own generation \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;prep school jerks and college jerks\u0026rdquo; (p. 91) \u0026ndash; particularly the students at Pencey and his former schools: \u0026ldquo;One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies\u0026rdquo; (p. 14). For Holden, being a phony means being fake, arrogant, and superficial.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden particularly criticizes Sally Hayes, calling her \u0026ldquo;the queen of the phonies\u0026rdquo; (p. 126) because of her superficiality and desire to appear perfect. Despite this, he is able to overlook Sally\u0026rsquo;s personality, which he finds annoying and loud, because she looks extremely attractive:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe looked terrific. She really did. (\u0026hellip;) I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I\u0026rsquo;m crazy. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. (p. 132)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden indeed tells Sally he loves her and asks her to run away with him. This highlights his \u003cstrong\u003econtradictory nature\u003c/strong\u003e and the fact that though he hates superficiality, he can also be rather superficial himself at times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-kblwa\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-kblwa\u0022\u003eHolden is fearful and frustrated with sexuality\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the issues that disturb Holden the most is his sexuality. Before meeting Sunny, the prostitute, Holden claims that he is a virgin but that he was close to having sex several times:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething always happens. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re at a girl\u0026rsquo;s house, her parents always come home at the wrong time \u0026ndash; or you\u0026rsquo;re afraid they will. Or if you\u0026rsquo;re in the back seat of somebody\u0026rsquo;s car, there\u0026rsquo;s always somebody\u0026rsquo;s date in the front seat \u0026ndash; some girl, I mean \u0026ndash; that always wants to know what\u0026rsquo;s going on all over the whole goddam car. (p. 100)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003efailed sexual experiences\u003c/strong\u003e are also strongly connected with instances of sexual abuse: \u0026ldquo;The thing is, most of the time when you\u0026rsquo;re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl (\u0026hellip;) she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don\u0026rsquo;t. I can\u0026rsquo;t help it\u0026rdquo; (p. 100). When he talks about Jane Gallagher, he even expresses his fear that Jane could have been sexually molested by her step-father.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0026rsquo;s inability to continue his sexual advances toward girls shows that he is afraid of coming across as abusive and pushy. This might suggest that he has a more \u003cstrong\u003emature and respectful\u003c/strong\u003e attitude towards sex than his peers, such as Stradlater, who he gives as an example of boys who are pushy and convince girls to have sex with them. He also feels that girls are either \u0026ldquo;scared as hell\u0026rdquo; (p. 100) or that they refuse to have sex because they feel refusing is the right thing to do. In this way, his failed sexual experiences create frustration, which Holden is unable to escape.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden is quite \u003cstrong\u003eflirty and sexually suggestive\u003c/strong\u003e with most of the other girls and women in the novel, including Sally and the three women at the Lavender Room. What is more, when he witnesses the scene with the couple spitting water in each other\u0026rsquo;s faces, Holden feels sexually aroused. He feels that \u0026ldquo;that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be\u0026rdquo; (p. 67), which shows that he is somehow bothered that he is aroused by the behavior he dislikes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen he meets Sunny, the prostitute, Holden feels \u0026ldquo;pretty sexy and all\u0026rdquo; (p. 100) but, as she takes off her dress, he starts feeling \u0026ldquo;peculiar\u0026rdquo; (p. 103). This moment, along with Holden\u0026rsquo;s need for a personal connection with Sunny, shows that he is not ready to take this big step. This suggests that Holden is \u003cstrong\u003eonly interested in the idea of sex\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-7qzss\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-7qzss\u0022\u003eHolden is concerned with preserving innocence\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough he is interested in sex and quite persistent to learn more about the topic in his conversation with Carl Luce, Holden is mainly \u003cstrong\u003epreoccupied with preserving innocence\u003c/strong\u003e. For him, the icons of innocence are his late brother, Allie, his sister, Phoebe, and all the children he comes across in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden is protective of children and observant of their needs. For example, when he notices that a skinny child has trouble balancing on the seesaw, he tries to help (p. 132). When one of his sister\u0026rsquo;s friends needs help with her skates, Holden jumps to the occasion and helps her (p. 129). This shows that he instinctively notices instances of injustice and tries to adopt \u003cstrong\u003ethe role of protector\u003c/strong\u003e:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody\u0026rsquo;s around \u0026ndash; nobody big, I mean \u0026ndash; except me. And I\u0026rsquo;m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff \u0026ndash; I mean if they\u0026rsquo;re running and they don\u0026rsquo;t look where they\u0026rsquo;re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them (\u0026hellip;) I\u0026rsquo;d just be the catcher in the rye and all. (p. 186)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis episode shows that Holden is caught between childhood and adulthood. He wants to preserve childhood innocence \u0026ndash; both in himself and in others \u0026ndash; and he is \u003cstrong\u003enot yet ready to embrace the responsibilities of adulthood\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-xi0uq\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-xi0uq\u0022\u003eHolden is traumatized and troubled\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden is \u003cstrong\u003edeeply affected by the death of his younger brother\u003c/strong\u003e, Allie, whom he saw as an innocent and perfect child. Holden speaks to Allie when he is depressed, either offering to make amends for the times when he thinks he has wronged Allie or asking him for help: \u0026ldquo;Boy, I felt miserable. I felt so depressed, you can\u0026rsquo;t imagine. What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed\u0026rdquo; (p. 107). He also dislikes going to the cemetery where Allie is buried and imagining his body in the ground. This all suggests that Holden is unable to come to terms with Allie\u0026rsquo;s death.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, Holden is \u003cstrong\u003edepressed\u003c/strong\u003e and unable to find joy in anything around him. When Phoebe asks him to name one thing he likes, Holden is only able to think of Allie:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;I like Allie,\u0026rsquo; I said. (\u0026hellip;)\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lsquo;Allie\u0026rsquo;s dead \u0026ndash; You always say that! If somebody\u0026rsquo;s dead and everything, and in Heaven, then it isn\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ndash;\u0026rsquo;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lsquo;I know he\u0026rsquo;s dead! Don\u0026rsquo;t you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can\u0026rsquo;t I? Just because somebody\u0026rsquo;s dead, you don\u0026rsquo;t just stop liking them, for God\u0026rsquo;s sake \u0026ndash; especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that\u0026rsquo;re alive and all.\u0026rsquo; (p. 178)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0026rsquo;s mental state and grief from losing his brother leave him wishing to avoid his reality, entertaining fantasies of running away, and unable to accept the passage of time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Characterization of Holden Caulfield","MetaDescription":"Holden Caulfield is the main character and narrator of J.
