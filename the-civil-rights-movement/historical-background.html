The Declaration of Independence&nbsp;did not change the status of slaves (even if it stated that "all men are created equal"),&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, between the creation of the independent United States&nbsp;(1776) and the American Civil War (1861-1865),&nbsp;<strong>several Northern states abolished slavery</strong>. The South, whose cotton industry was largely dependent on slave work, did not pass such abolitionist laws. On the contrary, it sought to strengthen slavery.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Because of anti-slavery laws in the North, African Americans were able to build a strong community and&nbsp;start advocating for their rights. As a result, anti-slavery activists &ndash; both white and black&mdash; formed the&nbsp;<strong>American Anti-Slavery Society&nbsp;</strong>in 1833.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Their efforts to end slavery and promote African-American civil rights were met with rejection through an 1857 US Supreme Court decision which effectively rejected African-American citizenship claims. This led to a stronger anti-slavery reaction and contributed to&nbsp;<strong>Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s election as US President</strong>, representing the Republican Party &ndash; also known as the anti-slavery party at the time.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Southern states refused to accept the abolitionist policies of the Republican Party, and this led to the start of the&nbsp;<strong>American Civil War</strong>. The South wanted to secede (separate) from the United States while the North aimed to preserve the union&nbsp;and eventually decided on a goal&nbsp;to end slavery in all states.&nbsp;This lead to the formation of the Union formed by 20 Northern free&nbsp;states and the Confederacy, formed by 11 Southern slave states.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Northern states depended on African-American soldiers during the war, aiding their eventual victory. This prompted Lincoln to pass the&nbsp;<strong>Emancipation Proclamation</strong>&nbsp;in January 1863, which stated</span><span style="color:#555555;">&nbsp;"that all persons held as slaves" in the states that attempted to secede "are, and henceforward shall be free." The proclamation did not end slavery entirely, but it began the important process of eradicating it.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="66045657-da56-45e7-8bf1-e4134676bba1">Emancipation laws</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Emancipation Proclamation of January&nbsp;1863 was only the first of a series of acts that were meant to abolish slavery and give African Americans equal rights. The Proclamation established that enslaved African Americans in ten of the rebellious&nbsp;Southern states that were not under the Union's control were to be free.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Note that, in Texas, the Proclamation did not become law until the&nbsp;19th of June, 1865, and the event turned into the celebration of&nbsp;<strong>Juneteenth Independence Day</strong>, which commemorates the abolition of slavery in the Southern States. The event is also a reminder of how African-American families used to be separated. Before the Civil War, it was not uncommon for African-American people and children in free states to be abducted and sold into slavery.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At the end of the Civil War,&nbsp;<strong>the Proclamation was extended through three constitutional amendments</strong>. The Thirteenth Amendment (1865) abolished slavery all across the US. The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) established the&nbsp;US citizenship of&nbsp;all former slaves. The Fifteenth Amendment (1870) granted voting rights to male African Americans. However, these laws were not universally enforced until much later.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">During the post-war Reconstruction period (1866-1877), attempts were made to promote the social and civil inclusion of African Americans, especially in the Southern states. However, this period also saw the rise of stronger anti-African-American attitudes in the South. It was at this time that&nbsp;<strong>movements such as the Ku Klux Klan</strong>&nbsp;were formed, advocating for white supremacy, through lynchings and other violent actions targeting African Americans. White people were sometimes able to take the law into their own hands through violent actions without fear of retribution.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In 1870 -1871,&nbsp;<strong>three Enforcement Acts</strong>&nbsp;were passed by the Congress aimed at protecting African Americans&rsquo; rights&nbsp;to vote,&nbsp;hold office, and receive equal legal protection.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However,&nbsp;<strong>the Compromise of 1877</strong>&nbsp;ended the Reconstruction period. The Compromise was an unwritten deal that allowed Republican Rutherford B. Hayes to become US President, knowing that he would retreat the military troops from Southern States.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">As the Reconstruction period ended&nbsp;and federal military retreated from the Southern states,&nbsp;<strong>a series of local laws were passed that began to restrict all the liberties African Americans had recently gained</strong>. These laws were known as the &lsquo;black codes&rsquo;.&nbsp;Some of these codes include&nbsp;poll taxes, requiring black people to pay to vote in elections. Others introduced literacy tests for African Americans before allowing them to vote.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="190b4888-8d37-439f-8d32-a15e5ff55438">Jim Crow laws and segregation</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After the Reconstruction, Southern states passed a series of laws and local constitutions which were meant to prevent African Americans from becoming registered voters and from voting. These laws are also known as&nbsp;<strong>disenfranchisement laws</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Gradually, black voters could neither vote nor be represented, and the South was overwhelmingly&nbsp;ruled by a white majority of representatives of the Democratic Party &ndash; which had historically been the&nbsp;party supporting slavery before and during the Civil War.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At the same time, segregation laws were passed and re-affirmed by US Supreme Court decisions, laws that were later known as the&nbsp;<strong>Jim Crow laws</strong>. Through these laws, African Americans were in many cases prevented from&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;public spaces with white Americans -&nbsp;including schools, hospitals, residential areas, bus seats, toilets, etc. This practice was enforced by the US Supreme Court decision of 1896 in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson. The decision established the&nbsp;<strong>doctrine of &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo;,</strong>&nbsp;as the Court decided that African Americans having separate facilities did not violate the Fourteen Amendment, granting them equal rights.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The separate but equal doctrine argued that as long as separated facilities were equal in providing African Americans access to state services, housing, education, employment, transportation, etc., it did not matter they were segregated.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In practice, African Americans were almost always&nbsp;discriminated by this doctrine because the facilities and services offered to them were often of much worse quality&nbsp;to those available for white people. Schools and hospitals were less well equipped, the residential areas for black citizens were poorer and smaller, and most jobs offered to African Americans were low-paid, with little opportunity for advancement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">In the North, segregation was not enforced by law, but it was still practiced on a large scale</span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">, especially in terms of residential areas. In 1912, President Woodrow Wilson also enforced segregation in the federal government.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">An important historical event during this time was&nbsp;<strong>the Wilmington insurrection of 1898</strong>, later known as a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat (an illegal overthrow of&nbsp;state institutions). Initially, the white leaders crushed what appeared to be a riot by black people. Later on, it was discovered that the event was orchestrated by white leaders to overthrow any African American influence in local politics and governance&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;ruling&nbsp;anti-slavery&nbsp;local government. Many African-American residents were killed during this episode, and&nbsp;their properties were destroyed.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="76525db6-5e37-4e41-9efc-065e246ed008">The Great Migration</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The discriminatory laws and the fact that African Americans were prevented from exercising their civil rights in the South&nbsp;lead to a huge migration of African Americans from Southern States to Northern states.&nbsp;Because the North was more industrialized and did not rely on the cotton industry, African Americans could find industrial jobs there and earn a living.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Known as the Great Migration, the period between 1910 and 1970 saw the movement of over 6&nbsp;million African Americans from South to North.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">This led to tensions and an increased practice of&nbsp;<strong>residential segregation in Northern states</strong>. African American ghettos were formed and various violent clashes between black and white groups took place. Some of the most notable are the Red Summer, the Chicago race riot, and the Omaha race riot, all taking place in 1919.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At the same, the migration of so many African Americans led to the creation of Harlem in New York, a black neighborhood. Black artists from Harlem gave birth to a movement called the&nbsp;<strong>Harlem Renaissance</strong>, which involved promoting African-American culture.</span></p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="c60bc64f-7416-41ec-8367-3e62f13bb326">Civil rights activism during the Jim Crow period</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">During the Jim Crow period of segregation and up to the start of the civil rights movement, members of the African American community and civil rights activists were already fighting racial discrimination.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In 1909, various activists formed the biracial&nbsp;<strong>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</strong>, which would become one of the most important civil rights organizations in the country. NAACP was originally led by W.E.B. Du Bois, a Harvard-educated activist and scholar.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The organization&rsquo;s preferred means of challenging racial discrimination were making injustices known to the public,&nbsp;filling lawsuits in court, and doing political lobby. However, other activist groups also formed which advocated for other ways to fight for civil rights, including marches and civil disobedience.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The World Wars - in which African Americans also fought - led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt passing&nbsp;<strong>an executive order in 1941 banning employment discrimination in the wartime industries</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After World War II, advocates of African American civil rights failed to unite because of ideological differences regarding foreign policy and the Cold War. In 1948, Harry S. Truman won the presidential elections with the support of NAACP leaders and of African American votes &ndash; where they were able to vote. Truman promoted civil rights by organizing a Civil Rights Committee in 1946 who issue a famous report in 1947&nbsp;called &ldquo;To Secure These Rights&rdquo;. The report exposed discrimination against African Americans and recommended various measures to end segregation.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The NAACP won more support by winning the US Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in 1954. The Court&rsquo;s ruling was that&nbsp;<strong>segregation in schools was illegal</strong>, overturning the 1896 Plessy v.
