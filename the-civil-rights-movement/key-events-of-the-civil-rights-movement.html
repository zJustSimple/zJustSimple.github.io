The movement fought against racial segregation and discrimination and tried to obtain legal and civil rights for African Americans.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The civil rights movement included a vast number of organizations, social actions and strategies, most of which focused on using non-violent means to promote their goals. Given the numerous&nbsp;<strong>events</strong>&nbsp;that took place during the civil rights movement, in what follows we will focus on some of the most important ones.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="d3f6bba1-363e-4b4b-87e6-c485cec8c91a"><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Montgomery Bus Boycott</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It is hard to place an exact starting date on the civil rights movement, but one of the first major protests was&nbsp;the Montgomery Bus Boycott. In 1955, a college-educated African-American woman named&nbsp;<strong>Rosa Parks</strong>&nbsp;refused to give her seat in the middle section of the bus to a white passenger, after the white seats were all occupied (African Americans were expected to give up seats in the middle section of the bus for white passengers). She was arrested for civil disobedience&nbsp;and soon became a national symbol of the movement.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Her arrest led to African Americans gathering and boycotting the buses to demand desegregation of the transport sector. For about a year, African Americans in Montgomery refused to take the bus (often walking many miles to work), causing economic losses to the transportation sector.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The boycott was joined by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. who soon became a prominent figure of the events. The local African-American leaders formed the&nbsp;<strong>Montgomery Improvement Association</strong>&nbsp;to organize the boycotts and chose King to lead them. During the boycott, King was arrested&nbsp;and his house was bombed.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At the same time, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) took Rosa Parks&rsquo; case to court, along with other similar cases. In one of the cases, Browder v. Gayle, the Supreme Court decided that bus segregation was unconstitutional.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The boycotts ended when&nbsp;<strong>the city banned segregation in buses</strong>, following the Court&rsquo;s decision.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="a9ca18ea-4607-452c-bc22-19d18cd19493"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Sit-ins</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Sit-ins were one of the main forms of protest between 1958 and 1960 and were generally organized by the NAACP Youth Council.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Sit-ins meant that African Americans would buy items from stores and then go to sit at the lunch counters of those stores, which were&nbsp;usually reserved for white people. When asked to leave, they would argue that if their money let them&nbsp;buy things, they should also be allowed to sit at the lunch counter. Such sit-ins were organized in various US states and also focused on parks, libraries, theaters, museums, etc, from which African Americans were banned.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="4af9a6da-175a-4294-9857-0d0a801863e5"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Freedom Rides</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Freedom Rides were organized in 1961 by civil rights activists who were riding interstate buses in Southern US. The activists were trying to show that a 1960 US Supreme Court decision banning segregation on interstate buses was not being implemented.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Freedom Rides were originally organized by the Congress of Racial Equality and involved racially mixed groups travelling and sitting together in buses.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Freedom riders were often met with violence, including a Ku Klux Klan attack and a bombing of a bus. In Jackson, Mississippi, the riders were arrested.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The media attention and support pushed President John&nbsp;F. Kennedy to demand &nbsp;<strong>a new desegregation order&nbsp;</strong>from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The new order allowed passengers to sit wherever they wanted&nbsp;and also enforced desegregated drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms in bus terminals.</span></p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="ceaa3f0c-dfdc-4dda-ba27-2229ab438e21"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Birmingham campaign</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Birmingham Campaign took place in 1963 and was organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), also led by&nbsp;<strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>&nbsp;The campaign followed a failure to promote desegregation in the city of Albany. The goal of the campaign was to obtain the desegregation of downtown shops and merchants.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">To achieve this goal, protesters organized sit-ins, visits at local churches, and a march to the county building. However, the local authorities obtained a legal order to end&nbsp;their protests, leading to the protest being brutally crushed and to the imprisonment of Martin Luther King Jr. along with other activists.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">King wrote the well-known&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;at this time, gaining more support and publicity for his cause. At the same time, one of the organizers decided to involve high school students and organize a mass demonstration.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Because of the media attention, the presidential administration intervened, pressuring local businesses to negotiate with the African-American community. Eventually,&nbsp;<strong>local&nbsp;merchants agreed to eliminate discriminatory employment practices and desegregate lunch counters and other public facilities</strong>.</span></p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="0cc89a9f-fdff-4a9f-a6fe-ba0e4a4e3b16"><span style="color:#1a242e;">March on Washington</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The March on Washington took place in August 1963, with the support and approval of the Kennedy Administration, after the organizers refused to give up the idea. The march was known as the&nbsp;<strong>March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</strong>&nbsp;and was organized to promote civil rights laws, equal employment opportunities, the right to vote, integrated education, and proper housing.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Over 200,000 people took part in the march, turning it into one of the largest human rights demonstrations in American history.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The event was largely organized by activist leaders Phillip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, but the main spokesperson was Martin Luther King Jr. who delivered his famous&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech</strong>&nbsp;when the group arrived in Washington.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The March on Washington was followed by a meeting between civil rights leaders and President Kennedy at the White House who decided to promote a civil rights bill in Congress.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The march and&nbsp;meeting were criticized by some other civil rights activists, including the&nbsp;</span> <span style="color:black;">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;(SNCC), which argued that the presidential administration was doing very little for African Americans in the South.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="f38f793a-c6d6-44af-969d-35063d8e0441"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Freedom Summer</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The phrase Freedom Summer&nbsp;refers to events taking place in the summer of 1964, just before the passing of&nbsp;</span> <span style="color:#0075e3;">the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span> <span style="color:#1a242e;">. During that summer, a large number of activists were brought to Mississippi to work together with local activists to register African-American voters&nbsp;and teach them about their rights and freedoms.&nbsp;This was because Mississippi had a long history of preventing African Americans from voting by introducing poll taxes and unfair literacy tests. The activists were trying to educate black voters to pass such literacy tests.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The local white population saw the activists as outsiders. When three activists disappeared and were found killed weeks later, this caused public outrage and pressured the government to pass the Civil Rights Act.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Throughout the rest of the summer, activists &ndash; black and white&mdash;continued to help with voter registration, although their efforts did not increase the number of African-American voters significantly.</span></p><h2 id="heading-8" data-guid="6026f0ce-7f3c-4671-b7d0-2f840ddc5fe4"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Selma to Montgomery marches</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Selma to Montgomery marches took places in 1965, as a result of the local authority&rsquo;s actions to prevent voter registration activities organized by Martin Luther King&rsquo;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) starting with 1963.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In total,&nbsp;three&nbsp;marches were organized. In 1965, King went to Selma to lead the marches and was arrested along with other protesters. After police dealt with the protests brutally and a protester was killed, civil rights leaders decided to organize a march from Selma to Montgomery, the state of Alabama&rsquo;s capital.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The first attempt was crushed as state troops attacked the non-violent protesters. Images surfaced on television to popular outrage. The event was called&nbsp;<strong>Bloody Sunday</strong>&nbsp;because of the violence that lead to 17 deaths and 50 people getting injured on Edmund Pettus Bridge.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">King organized a second march two weeks later which was approved by the authorities. However, the second march was not without incidents as several other protesters were killed, pointing to the brutal way in which protesters were treated by police and authorities.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">A third march was organized after a federal judged ruled in favor of the protesters, deciding they have the right to march. The march ended with King&rsquo;s speech, &ldquo;How Long, Not Long&rdquo;. In the speech, King argued that granting African Americans&nbsp;equal civil rights was&nbsp;inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">A week after the march,<strong>&nbsp;the US President Lyndon B. Johnson&nbsp;publicly affirmed his support for the Voting Rights Act</strong>. The act was adopted a few months later.</span></p><h2 id="heading-9" data-guid="8c63abe5-e2d4-427d-b843-06a22b4f90ba"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Riots during the civil rights movement</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">A largely peaceful and non-violent form of mass protest, the civil rights movement also included several more violent encounters between protesters and authorities known as riots, often prompted by frustrations in the African-American community over treatment by the authorities. Here are some of the most important ones.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Harlem Riot</span></strong> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;took place in 1964 as residents clashed with authorities, frustrated by the poor housing and employment conditions in Harlem.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Watts Riot</span></strong> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;took place in 1965 in a poor Los Angeles neighborhood where African-American residents clashed with a white police department. This triggered&nbsp;massive destruction of property during six days of rioting.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The nationwide riots of 1967</span></strong> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;took place in various cities in the US. The riots were triggered by&nbsp;frustration with housing and economic inequality and involved looting and property destruction. Often the riots would be triggered by a clash with the authorities.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The nationwide riots and marches of 1968</span></strong> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;were triggered by King&rsquo;s assassination. In some places in&nbsp;the US, King&rsquo;s death fueled African Americans&rsquo; frustrations with continuing inequality and lead to violent incidents and property destruction. However, the leaders of the civil rights movement also succeeded in organizing peaceful marches meant to promote unity in the community after King&rsquo;s death.</span></p><h2 id="heading-10" data-guid="87a692f1-cf65-4568-a21a-61af93b8d7aa"><span style="color:#1a242e;">From Black Nationalism to the Black Power Movement</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Black Power Movement was one of the consequences of the civil rights movement.&nbsp;The Black Power Movement was based&nbsp;on Black Nationalism which promotes the idea that African Americans should be proud of their racial heritage and refuse to integrate into mainstream white society.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Black Nationalism developed through the religious organization&nbsp;<strong>the Nation of Islam</strong>, led by Elijah Muhammad, of which&nbsp;</span> <span style="color:#0075e3;">Malcolm X</span> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;was also a part of in the beginning. The Nation of Islam and Black Nationalists refused the idea of integration (the goal of&nbsp;the civil rights movement) and instead promoted the idea of black autonomous communities, closed off to mainstream white American society.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">When Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam, he began to support the idea of integration and fighting for civil rights. However, he also mentioned his support for Black Nationalism and argued that other means &ndash; potentially even&nbsp;violent ones &ndash; could be used to advance the African-American cause if their demands were not met fast enough.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Black Power Movement grew out of the civil rights movement. After the death of Malcolm X, the movement was led by the&nbsp;<strong>Black Panther Party</strong>whose main goal was to protect African Americans against institutionalized racism and state violence. Activists also funded and built black businesses, designed to serve only black people.&nbsp;However, they would also patrol black neighborhoods armed and react violently&nbsp;when they&nbsp;noticed African Americans' rights being violated. This led to fatal firefights which killed various police officers.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">As the movement gained a more negative reputation because of violence and illegal actions connected to its members, it also began to lose public support.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="historical-background.html" title="The Civil Rights Movement | Historical background" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Historical background</span></a><a href="important-people.html#heading-4" title="The Civil Rights Movement | Important people" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Important people</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
