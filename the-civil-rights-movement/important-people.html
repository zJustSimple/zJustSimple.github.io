Du Bois (1868-1963)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">W. E. B. Du Bois was one of the early activists for African-American rights, before the start of the civil rights movement in the 1950s. He was an African American who was educated at Harvard as a historian and sociologist. Du Bois was one of the first African-American leaders to advocate for full civil rights and increased political representation, instead of a progressive approach to civil rights, favored by other&nbsp;members of the African-American intellectual elite.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and actively promoted equal rights, while exposing racial injustices through his writings.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Du Bois was also a supporter of socialism during the Cold War, when anti-communist feelings where very strong in the US. The FBI even accused him of working for another state's interest. As a result, he lost popularity and the support of NAACP and never became an active figure in the subsequent civil rights movement. However, note that he also supported Democrat politicians&nbsp;he believed would&nbsp;help the African-American civil rights cause.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="aa892e83-5530-4d40-bdca-f112b1e134b2"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Rosa Parks (1913-2005)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Rosa Parks was an African-American civil rights activist who became widely known for her role in the&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#0075e3;">Montgomery Bus Boycott</span> <span style="color:#1a242e;">. In 1955, Parks refused to give up her place in the bus to a white person after the places specifically allocated to white people were filled. She was arrested for civil disobedience. Although she was not the first person to challenge bus segregation, the NAACP chose to take her case to court.&nbsp;Parks&rsquo; actions became a symbol of the civil rights movement because they inspired&nbsp;a whole range of similar peaceful protests.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Throughout her life, she worked as an activist with African-American organizations, and later on&nbsp;she supported the Black Power movement.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="3baa7a7e-3286-4e59-b91b-69dcc4e19bee"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent leader of the civil rights movement, becoming one of its main spokespeople. A Baptist minister, King always advocated for fighting for civil rights through non-violent means such as marches,&nbsp;</span> <span style="color:#0075e3;">sit-ins</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">, or civil disobedience. He became a leader of the movement after he lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He helped to organize some of the most important campaigns and marches of the civil rights movement including&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#0075e3;">the March on Washington, the Birmingham campaign, and the Selma to Montgomery marches</span> <span style="color:#1a242e;">.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He was the founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an organization which was meant to gain the support of Southern churches and unite them to promote the civil rights movement.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">As a key public speaker for the movement, King become very influential through his speeches and writings. Some of his most famous speeches are &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; delivered during the 1963 March on Washington&nbsp;and&nbsp; "I've Been to the Mountaintop"&nbsp;delivered a day before he was killed. One of his most famous writings is &ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail&rdquo;, written&nbsp;in jail during the Birmingham Campaign.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">King&rsquo;s actions were highlighted when he won the&nbsp;<strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong>&nbsp;in 1964, leading to global awareness about the civil rights movement and pressuring the government to address the issue. King was assassinated in 1968 by a white supremacist, leading to nation-wide riots.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="8edb1d11-665d-48b0-9f94-24b7b7afbca9"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Malcolm X (1925-1965)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Malcolm X was a prominent figure in the time of the civil rights movement. He was initially an important public speaker as a member of the black nationalist organization the Nation of Islam in the early 1950s, after converting to Islam in prison.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At first, Malcolm X advocated for black supremacy and the separation of black and white Americans, so that African Americans could live in autonomous communities. Gradually, he distanced himself from the Nation of Islam and became a supporter of the civil rights movement.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">His role in the movement was to encourage Muslim African Americans to join the cause of the civil rights. He often commented on the civil rights movement, including at the UN General Council in 1960 where he condemned the US's&nbsp;attitude towards African Americans.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, unlike Martin Luther King Jr. who supported non-violent protests and civil disobedience, Malcolm X did not exclude the use of violence as a means for obtaining civil rights. Furthermore, he continued to promote the idea of black pride although he started to work towards integration. His assassination by rivals in the Nation of Islam cut short his role in the movement. However, his ideas continued to&nbsp;influence&nbsp;the&nbsp;Black Power Movement in the 1960s -1970s.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="f287a3ca-55e3-45b4-9b33-fdc82a50c89f"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Dwight D. Eisenhower was the 34</span><sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">th</span></sup> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;US President, holding office between 1953 and 1961. He was one of the least supportive presidents towards the civil rights movement, much of which unfolded during his two terms in office.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Eisenhower did not believe integration was possible. When the US Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that school segregation was illegal, the President had no official reaction. He did not support the desegregation of the army, implemented by his predecessor President Harry S. Truman. He also associated civil rights activists with communism and banned any homosexual person from seeking federal employment.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Although he did propose and sign&nbsp;into law the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960, the changes proposed by those acts were minor. The acts established a civil rights office within the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to deal with complaints regarding voting rights violations.</span></p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="258c11f2-e308-4703-80b3-104adad8636b"><span style="color:#1a242e;">John F. Kennedy (1917- 1963)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">John F. Kennedy served as the 35</span><sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">th</span></sup> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;US President, between 1961 and 1963. During his electoral campaign, Kennedy promised to work to end racial discrimination and even helped in getting Martin Luther King Jr. released from prison in 1960.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Kennedy decided to postpone civil rights legislation when he took office but appointed various African Americans in his office. Kennedy feared negative reactions from the white South if he met all of the&nbsp;civil rights movement's demands, and so he instead favored a gradual approach, which would have been more acceptable to the Congress as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, Kennedy changed his views after the Birmingham Campaign and affirmed his support for African-American civil rights through the&nbsp;<strong>1963 Report to the American People on Civil Rights</strong>&nbsp;which was broadcast on national television and radio. In the speech, he proposed to launch a series of civil rights reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Kennedy was assassinated a few months later, but many of his proposed reforms were included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</span></p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="5c57ac68-ee4e-45c6-aa97-c1b28c534783"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973)</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Lyndon B. Johnson served as the 36</span><sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">th</span></sup> <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;US President between 1963 and 1969 and is considered one of the most supportive presidents regarding the civil rights movement.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Johnson took office after Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination and during his term both&nbsp;</span> the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act <span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;were passed, officially ending segregation and securing equal voting rights for African Americans.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, which required a lot of political tactics to get the Congress to vote for it, Johnson was not keen on putting pressure on&nbsp;Congress again for&nbsp;the Voting Rights Act.
