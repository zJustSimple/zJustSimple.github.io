His name, age, or occupation are not mentioned. We cannot even be certain of his gender, though we have chosen to assume that he is male because of his reference to madmen:&nbsp;&ldquo;Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing&rdquo;.</p><h3 id="heading-cioon">Inner characterisation</h3><p>The narrator of the story is a troubled person who has killed an old man he has been living with. In his account of the events, he tries to explain why and how he murdered the old man to prove he is not mad.</p><p>The narrator is <strong>convinced he is not insane</strong> and tries to prove it by explaining what he did and contrasting it with what he thinks madmen are like:&nbsp;&ldquo;How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily -how calmly I can tell you the whole story&rdquo;;&nbsp;&ldquo;Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded -with what caution -with what foresight -with what dissimulation I went to work!&rdquo;</p><p>However, the narrator is <strong>under the impression that he possesses heightened senses that resemble supernatural abilities</strong>:​&nbsp;&ldquo;Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell&rdquo;.</p><p>He argues for his sanity by claiming that he is calm and that he was able to maintain rationality and to plot and kill the old man: &ldquo;It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this?&rdquo;; &ldquo;If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.&rdquo;</p><p>His <strong>attitude towards the old man is contradictory</strong>. He sees his victim from two perspectives. On the one hand, he admits he loves the old man who has done nothing to upset him:​&nbsp;&ldquo;I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire&rdquo;. On the other hand, he is enraged and obsessed with the old man&rsquo;s blue eye which he considers evil, and he has, therefore, decided to kill him:</p><blockquote><p>I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture -a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees -very gradually -I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, his actions regarding the old man are also contradictory. During daytime, he treats the old man kindly, while at night he spies on him: &ldquo;I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it -oh so gently!&rdquo;. However, this behaviour can be motivated by the narrator&rsquo;s wish to avoid raising suspicion in the old man:</p><blockquote><p>And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.</p></blockquote><p>His attitude in the night of the murder suggests<strong> predatory behaviour</strong>. He takes many precautions, such as carefully opening the lantern as to not make noise, and taking an hour to open the door. In the end, he attacks <strong>ruthlessly</strong>: &ldquo;In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him&rdquo;.</p><p>The narrator is <strong>emotionally unstable</strong>, as he appears to be often overcome by feelings of terror. He states that he feels intense fear at night: &ldquo;Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me&rdquo;. He also has an unstable behaviour while in the same room with the old man: he is at first nervous but then becomes overcome by terror.</p><p>The narrator <strong>holds an irrational fear of the old man&rsquo;s eye</strong>. When he sneaks into his room, the narrator points his lantern only towards the eye: &ldquo;I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot&rdquo;. This shows that the narrator is not focused on the&nbsp;old man as a person. Although he recognises that the man shares a similar feeling of terror that serves as a shared experience between them, the narrator is unable to emphasise with the old man and shows no sympathy towards him.</p><p>He <strong>seems to feel</strong>&nbsp;<strong>no guilt</strong> after killing the old man, a feature that is commonly associated with psychopaths. He cuts the man into pieces and hides the corpse meticulously under the floor:&nbsp;&ldquo;First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs&rdquo;.&nbsp;He also seems to be very pleased with his way of handling the situation and finds amusement in his solution:&nbsp;&ldquo;There was nothing to wash out -no stain of any kind -no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all -ha! ha!&rdquo;; &ldquo;I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done&rdquo;. The narrator glorifies his actions and <strong>takes pride in the murder</strong> he has committed: &ldquo;You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work!&rdquo;; &ldquo;I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim&rdquo;.</p><p>However, when the policemen come, he starts hearing the pounding of the old man&rsquo;s heart until it becomes unbearable. He eventually confesses to the police. Notice that his <strong>remorse</strong> is not processed by his mind normally. Instead of regretting he had killed a man, he is only bothered by the sound of the heart he keeps hearing and his belief that the policemen are aware of his guilt and are mocking him:&nbsp;&ldquo;But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now -again! -hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!&rdquo;.</p><p>Overall, we can say that the narrator exhibits traits associated with psychopaths and that he is in denial of his mental instability. He is meticulous and extremely cautious in his interactions with the old man while he is planning the murder, until the final burst when he becomes furious and kills the man. After the murder, he is cheerful and pleased with his work. However, in the end, he has a nervous breakdown which pushes him to confess.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="structure.html" title="Structure of The Tell-Tale Heart" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Structure</span></a><a href="setting.html" title="Setting of The Tell-Tale Heart" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Setting</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

His name, age, or occupation are not mentioned. We cannot even be certain of his gender, though we have chosen to assume that he is male because of his reference to madmen:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-cioon\u0022\u003eInner characterisation\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator of the story is a troubled person who has killed an old man he has been living with. In his account of the events, he tries to explain why and how he murdered the old man to prove he is not mad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator is \u003cstrong\u003econvinced he is not insane\u003c/strong\u003e and tries to prove it by explaining what he did and contrasting it with what he thinks madmen are like:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily -how calmly I can tell you the whole story\u0026rdquo;;\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded -with what caution -with what foresight -with what dissimulation I went to work!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the narrator is \u003cstrong\u003eunder the impression that he possesses heightened senses that resemble supernatural abilities\u003c/strong\u003e:​\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe argues for his sanity by claiming that he is calm and that he was able to maintain rationality and to plot and kill the old man: \u0026ldquo;It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this?\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis \u003cstrong\u003eattitude towards the old man is contradictory\u003c/strong\u003e. He sees his victim from two perspectives. On the one hand, he admits he loves the old man who has done nothing to upset him:​\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire\u0026rdquo;. On the other hand, he is enraged and obsessed with the old man\u0026rsquo;s blue eye which he considers evil, and he has, therefore, decided to kill him:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture -a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees -very gradually -I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, his actions regarding the old man are also contradictory. During daytime, he treats the old man kindly, while at night he spies on him: \u0026ldquo;I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it -oh so gently!\u0026rdquo;. However, this behaviour can be motivated by the narrator\u0026rsquo;s wish to avoid raising suspicion in the old man:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis attitude in the night of the murder suggests\u003cstrong\u003e predatory behaviour\u003c/strong\u003e. He takes many precautions, such as carefully opening the lantern as to not make noise, and taking an hour to open the door. In the end, he attacks \u003cstrong\u003eruthlessly\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator is \u003cstrong\u003eemotionally unstable\u003c/strong\u003e, as he appears to be often overcome by feelings of terror. He states that he feels intense fear at night: \u0026ldquo;Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me\u0026rdquo;. He also has an unstable behaviour while in the same room with the old man: he is at first nervous but then becomes overcome by terror.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator \u003cstrong\u003eholds an irrational fear of the old man\u0026rsquo;s eye\u003c/strong\u003e. When he sneaks into his room, the narrator points his lantern only towards the eye: \u0026ldquo;I could see nothing else of the old man\u0027s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot\u0026rdquo;. This shows that the narrator is not focused on the\u0026nbsp;old man as a person. Although he recognises that the man shares a similar feeling of terror that serves as a shared experience between them, the narrator is unable to emphasise with the old man and shows no sympathy towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe \u003cstrong\u003eseems to feel\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eno guilt\u003c/strong\u003e after killing the old man, a feature that is commonly associated with psychopaths. He cuts the man into pieces and hides the corpse meticulously under the floor:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs\u0026rdquo;.\u0026nbsp;He also seems to be very pleased with his way of handling the situation and finds amusement in his solution:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;There was nothing to wash out -no stain of any kind -no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all -ha! ha!\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done\u0026rdquo;. The narrator glorifies his actions and \u003cstrong\u003etakes pride in the murder\u003c/strong\u003e he has committed: \u0026ldquo;You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work!\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, when the policemen come, he starts hearing the pounding of the old man\u0026rsquo;s heart until it becomes unbearable. He eventually confesses to the police. Notice that his \u003cstrong\u003eremorse\u003c/strong\u003e is not processed by his mind normally. Instead of regretting he had killed a man, he is only bothered by the sound of the heart he keeps hearing and his belief that the policemen are aware of his guilt and are mocking him:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now -again! -hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, we can say that the narrator exhibits traits associated with psychopaths and that he is in denial of his mental instability. He is meticulous and extremely cautious in his interactions with the old man while he is planning the murder, until the final burst when he becomes furious and kills the man.
