She is forced to mature rapidly, which changes her.</p><p>At the beginning of 1944, in the course of her continuous self-reflection, Anne <strong>looks back on her life and divides it into different phases</strong>, which we will use below. As a result, we can see how Anne develops from a rather clueless schoolgirl into an independent person and thinker in just two years.</p><p>&nbsp;During this period, the rebel <strong>learns to see things from other people's perspectives</strong> and to better understand her parents' point of view. By the end of her unfinished diary, for example, she is able to express feminist points of view or analyze her own character with an amazing eloquence. After the war, she wants to become a writer and live in Holland.</p><h2 id="heading-etdbl" data-guid="18f47edc-3914-40d8-bd08-28efee474351">Anne&rsquo;s popularity</h2><p>At the beginning of 1944, Anne's life before going into hiding seems like an unreal &ldquo;heavenly existence&rdquo; (62%). On the surface, she has everything she could want during this period: &ldquo;Five admirers on every street corner, twenty or so friends, the favorite of most of my teachers, spoiled rotten by Father and Mother, bags full of candy and a big allowance. What more could anyone ask for?&rdquo; (62%).&nbsp;</p><p>Anne`s cheerful and generous nature makes her popular with everyone, she is considered the &ldquo;class comedian&rdquo; (62%), and <strong>she is constantly the center of attention</strong>.</p><p>Despite the sheltered and seemingly carefree life, Anne is not unreservedly happy during her school years. Even before going into hiding, she longs for a true confidant - out of this longing she decides to write a diary and address it to her imagined friend Kitty.</p><h2 id="heading-o04zs" data-guid="73d9f706-c57b-467b-b8e7-de65f789db17">Anne at the center of disputes</h2><p>Anne is suddenly forced to say goodbye to her old life when she moves into the secret annex with her family. <strong>She is no longer the center of admiration</strong>, a circumstance she can hardly get used to: &ldquo;It took me more than a year to get used to doing without admiration.&rdquo; (62%).</p><p>During the first six months of her hiding, Anne <strong>feels that her character is being severely criticized from all sides</strong>, instead of being praised by everyone: &ldquo;They criticize everything, and I mean everything, about me (&hellip;)&rdquo; (13%). Suddenly she is treated with a harshness that she has never experienced before and that shakes her up inside greatly.&nbsp;</p><p>Anne is caught <strong>completely unprepared by the unfamiliar criticism</strong> and is not ready to simply accept it. In her first six months in the secret annex, she is so indignant about the adults' criticizing behavior that she vows to repay them in kind: &ldquo;But as soon as I&rsquo;ve gotten used to the idea, and that shouldn&rsquo;t take long, I&rsquo;ll give them a taste of their own medicine, and then they&rsquo;ll change their tune!&rdquo; (13%).</p><p>Looking back, Anne realizes that only her boldness helped her keep her balance: &ldquo;When I was at home, my life was filled with sunshine. Then, in the middle of 1942, everything changed overnight. The quarrels, the accusations&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t take it all in. I was caught off guard, and the only way I knew to keep my bearings was to talk back.&rdquo; (62%).</p><h2 id="heading-97zp4" data-guid="a5d4fdbc-feb2-4654-b3c1-68264e6c98fc">Anne's loneliness</h2><p>In the second half year of the hiding, in other words in the first half of 1943, Anne becomes more and more affected by the criticism coming at her from all sides. Although she does not let it show on the outside, she is deeply saddened by the &ldquo;nasty words, mocking looks and accusations that [her mother] hurls at [her] day after day, piercing [her] like arrows from a tightly strung bow, which are nearly impossible to pull from [her] body.&rdquo; (24%).&nbsp;</p><p>Although she tries not to let her grief show, she is <strong>caught up in constant self-doubt</strong> and secretly wants &ldquo;to please everyone&rdquo; (24%). She does not find the desired support from her family either. From the beginning Anne has the feeling that she will not fit in with them.</p><p>Looking back, Anne assesses this period of loneliness and self-doubt as a particularly dark one in the secret annex.</p><h2 id="heading-a7z5b" data-guid="a2ada64a-1a4f-4764-907f-bd7424d353a8">Anne relies on herself</h2><p>In the second half of 1943, the third half year in hiding, Anne's situation has improved noticeably. She has become more mature and no longer faces daily criticism from the other residents of the secret annex.&nbsp;</p><p>Anne realizes that in order to keep peace in the secret annex, it is often better to be more reserved about her own opinions : &ldquo;But I can see that a little hypocrisy gets me a lot further than my old method of saying exactly what I think&rdquo; (31%). Although she still often falls out of the role of the exemplary teenager, she manages to &ldquo;keep the rain of rebukes to a light drizzle&rdquo; (31%).</p><p>In general, this phase in Anne's life is marked by a <strong>deep reflection on her social relationships</strong>. She comes to the realization that she cannot rely on her parents to raise her to be a better person in terms of character. All efforts in this regard would have to arise from her own impulse: &ldquo;I have to mother myself. I&rsquo;ve cut myself adrift from them. I&rsquo;m charting my own course, and we&rsquo;ll see where it leads me.&rdquo; (42%).&nbsp;</p><p>Although Anne &nbsp;had previously strongly idealized her father and clung to his admiration, she now feels withdrawn from him as well. He also does not fulfill his responsibilities to her and treats her too much like a small child.</p><p>Despite learning more and more to see things from other people's perspectives and to better understand her parents' point of view, Anne comes to the realization in this stage of her life that <strong>she can only rely on herself</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>I became a teenager, and was treated more like a grown-up. I began to think about things and to write stories, finally coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had anything to do with me. (&hellip;) I didn&rsquo;t trust anyone but myself. (62%).</p></blockquote><p>In early 1944, Anne reflects on her relationship with the van Daans and realizes that arguments with them were based on misconduct on both sides. She recognizes how easy it would be to keep peace in the secret annex if everyone was more understanding of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Reflecting on old quarrels, Anne discovers with self-criticism that she has already changed considerably: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed quite drastically, everything about me is different: my opinions, ideas, critical outlook. Inwardly, outwardly, nothing&rsquo;s the same. And, I might safely add, since it&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;ve changed for the better.&rdquo; (70%).</p><h2 id="heading-bu1j4" data-guid="48ac48be-ab49-4da7-9b2b-fa502834614f">Tenderness and contemplation</h2><p>After Anne dreams of her childhood love, Peter Schiff, and thereby discovers her desire for the opposite sex, she feels older and she has &ldquo;grown up&rdquo; (51%). Her falling in love with Peter van Daan is the highlight of her time in secret annex. She <strong>discovers a softer side to herself</strong> and finally finds something to look forward to every day: &ldquo;I also discovered an inner happiness underneath my superficial and cheerful exterior. (&hellip;) Now I live only for Peter, since what happens to me in the future depends largely on him!&rdquo; (62%).&nbsp;</p><p>For Anne, the conquest of Peter van Daan dominates the first half of 1944 (see also &ldquo;<a href="https://liceunet.ro/jurnalul-annei-frank/themes/love">Love</a>&rdquo;). However, when she turns away from him again after the initial phase of falling in love and devotes more time to her own thoughts, it becomes apparent how independently and deeply Anne can think about the world although she is just fifteen years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Anne ponders man's relationship to nature, expresses feminist points of view, and analyzes her own character with an astonishing intellectual insight and eloquence.</p><p>At fourteen, when she looks back on her school days, Anne <strong>can hardly identify with her former sel</strong>f: &ldquo;I look back at that Anne Frank as a pleasant, amusing, but superficial girl, who has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; (62%). While she would love to relive the carefree cheerfulness for a few days, <strong>she is sure she could never go back to living her old life the same way</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Anne would no longer care about being admired. Instead, she would like to have a small circle of sincere friends who appreciate her for herself. She feels she has clearly outgrown her old life: &ldquo;(&hellip;) my happy-go-lucky, carefree schooldays are gone forever. I don&rsquo;t even miss them. I&rsquo;ve outgrown them.

She is forced to mature rapidly, which changes her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 1944, in the course of her continuous self-reflection, Anne \u003cstrong\u003elooks back on her life and divides it into different phases\u003c/strong\u003e, which we will use below. As a result, we can see how Anne develops from a rather clueless schoolgirl into an independent person and thinker in just two years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;During this period, the rebel \u003cstrong\u003elearns to see things from other people\u0027s perspectives\u003c/strong\u003e and to better understand her parents\u0027 point of view. By the end of her unfinished diary, for example, she is able to express feminist points of view or analyze her own character with an amazing eloquence. After the war, she wants to become a writer and live in Holland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-etdbl\u0022 data-guid=\u002218f47edc-3914-40d8-bd08-28efee474351\u0022\u003eAnne\u0026rsquo;s popularity\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 1944, Anne\u0027s life before going into hiding seems like an unreal \u0026ldquo;heavenly existence\u0026rdquo; (62%). On the surface, she has everything she could want during this period: \u0026ldquo;Five admirers on every street corner, twenty or so friends, the favorite of most of my teachers, spoiled rotten by Father and Mother, bags full of candy and a big allowance. What more could anyone ask for?\u0026rdquo; (62%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne`s cheerful and generous nature makes her popular with everyone, she is considered the \u0026ldquo;class comedian\u0026rdquo; (62%), and \u003cstrong\u003eshe is constantly the center of attention\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the sheltered and seemingly carefree life, Anne is not unreservedly happy during her school years. Even before going into hiding, she longs for a true confidant - out of this longing she decides to write a diary and address it to her imagined friend Kitty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-o04zs\u0022 data-guid=\u002273d9f706-c57b-467b-b8e7-de65f789db17\u0022\u003eAnne at the center of disputes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne is suddenly forced to say goodbye to her old life when she moves into the secret annex with her family. \u003cstrong\u003eShe is no longer the center of admiration\u003c/strong\u003e, a circumstance she can hardly get used to: \u0026ldquo;It took me more than a year to get used to doing without admiration.\u0026rdquo; (62%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the first six months of her hiding, Anne \u003cstrong\u003efeels that her character is being severely criticized from all sides\u003c/strong\u003e, instead of being praised by everyone: \u0026ldquo;They criticize everything, and I mean everything, about me (\u0026hellip;)\u0026rdquo; (13%). Suddenly she is treated with a harshness that she has never experienced before and that shakes her up inside greatly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne is caught \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely unprepared by the unfamiliar criticism\u003c/strong\u003e and is not ready to simply accept it. In her first six months in the secret annex, she is so indignant about the adults\u0027 criticizing behavior that she vows to repay them in kind: \u0026ldquo;But as soon as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten used to the idea, and that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take long, I\u0026rsquo;ll give them a taste of their own medicine, and then they\u0026rsquo;ll change their tune!\u0026rdquo; (13%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking back, Anne realizes that only her boldness helped her keep her balance: \u0026ldquo;When I was at home, my life was filled with sunshine. Then, in the middle of 1942, everything changed overnight. The quarrels, the accusations\u0026mdash;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t take it all in. I was caught off guard, and the only way I knew to keep my bearings was to talk back.\u0026rdquo; (62%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-97zp4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a5d4fdbc-feb2-4654-b3c1-68264e6c98fc\u0022\u003eAnne\u0027s loneliness\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the second half year of the hiding, in other words in the first half of 1943, Anne becomes more and more affected by the criticism coming at her from all sides. Although she does not let it show on the outside, she is deeply saddened by the \u0026ldquo;nasty words, mocking looks and accusations that [her mother] hurls at [her] day after day, piercing [her] like arrows from a tightly strung bow, which are nearly impossible to pull from [her] body.\u0026rdquo; (24%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough she tries not to let her grief show, she is \u003cstrong\u003ecaught up in constant self-doubt\u003c/strong\u003e and secretly wants \u0026ldquo;to please everyone\u0026rdquo; (24%). She does not find the desired support from her family either. From the beginning Anne has the feeling that she will not fit in with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking back, Anne assesses this period of loneliness and self-doubt as a particularly dark one in the secret annex.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-a7z5b\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a2ada64a-1a4f-4764-907f-bd7424d353a8\u0022\u003eAnne relies on herself\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the second half of 1943, the third half year in hiding, Anne\u0027s situation has improved noticeably. She has become more mature and no longer faces daily criticism from the other residents of the secret annex.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne realizes that in order to keep peace in the secret annex, it is often better to be more reserved about her own opinions : \u0026ldquo;But I can see that a little hypocrisy gets me a lot further than my old method of saying exactly what I think\u0026rdquo; (31%). Although she still often falls out of the role of the exemplary teenager, she manages to \u0026ldquo;keep the rain of rebukes to a light drizzle\u0026rdquo; (31%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, this phase in Anne\u0027s life is marked by a \u003cstrong\u003edeep reflection on her social relationships\u003c/strong\u003e. She comes to the realization that she cannot rely on her parents to raise her to be a better person in terms of character. All efforts in this regard would have to arise from her own impulse: \u0026ldquo;I have to mother myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve cut myself adrift from them. I\u0026rsquo;m charting my own course, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see where it leads me.\u0026rdquo; (42%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Anne \u0026nbsp;had previously strongly idealized her father and clung to his admiration, she now feels withdrawn from him as well. He also does not fulfill his responsibilities to her and treats her too much like a small child.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite learning more and more to see things from other people\u0027s perspectives and to better understand her parents\u0027 point of view, Anne comes to the realization in this stage of her life that \u003cstrong\u003eshe can only rely on herself\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI became a teenager, and was treated more like a grown-up. I began to think about things and to write stories, finally coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had anything to do with me. (\u0026hellip;) I didn\u0026rsquo;t trust anyone but myself. (62%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn early 1944, Anne reflects on her relationship with the van Daans and realizes that arguments with them were based on misconduct on both sides. She recognizes how easy it would be to keep peace in the secret annex if everyone was more understanding of each other.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReflecting on old quarrels, Anne discovers with self-criticism that she has already changed considerably: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve changed quite drastically, everything about me is different: my opinions, ideas, critical outlook. Inwardly, outwardly, nothing\u0026rsquo;s the same. And, I might safely add, since it\u0026rsquo;s true, I\u0026rsquo;ve changed for the better.\u0026rdquo; (70%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-bu1j4\u0022 data-guid=\u002248ac48be-ab49-4da7-9b2b-fa502834614f\u0022\u003eTenderness and contemplation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Anne dreams of her childhood love, Peter Schiff, and thereby discovers her desire for the opposite sex, she feels older and she has \u0026ldquo;grown up\u0026rdquo; (51%). Her falling in love with Peter van Daan is the highlight of her time in secret annex. She \u003cstrong\u003ediscovers a softer side to herself\u003c/strong\u003e and finally finds something to look forward to every day: \u0026ldquo;I also discovered an inner happiness underneath my superficial and cheerful exterior. (\u0026hellip;) Now I live only for Peter, since what happens to me in the future depends largely on him!\u0026rdquo; (62%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Anne, the conquest of Peter van Daan dominates the first half of 1944 (see also \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/jurnalul-annei-frank/themes/love\u0022\u003eLove\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;). However, when she turns away from him again after the initial phase of falling in love and devotes more time to her own thoughts, it becomes apparent how independently and deeply Anne can think about the world although she is just fifteen years old.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne ponders man\u0027s relationship to nature, expresses feminist points of view, and analyzes her own character with an astonishing intellectual insight and eloquence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt fourteen, when she looks back on her school days, Anne \u003cstrong\u003ecan hardly identify with her former sel\u003c/strong\u003ef: \u0026ldquo;I look back at that Anne Frank as a pleasant, amusing, but superficial girl, who has nothing to do with me.\u0026rdquo; (62%). While she would love to relive the carefree cheerfulness for a few days, \u003cstrong\u003eshe is sure she could never go back to living her old life the same way\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne would no longer care about being admired. Instead, she would like to have a small circle of sincere friends who appreciate her for herself. She feels she has clearly outgrown her old life: \u0026ldquo;(\u0026hellip;) my happy-go-lucky, carefree schooldays are gone forever. I don\u0026rsquo;t even miss them. I\u0026rsquo;ve outgrown them.
