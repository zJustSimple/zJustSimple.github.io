Anne is a pubescent girl who admits in her diary to longing for her first period. She reflects on what happened on January 6, 1944:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Yesterday I read an article on blushing by Sis Heyster. (&hellip;) What she basically says is that during puberty girls withdraw into themselves and begin thinking about the wondrous changes taking place in their bodies. (&hellip;) Whenever I get my period (and that&rsquo;s only been three times), I have the feeling that in spite of all the pain, discomfort and mess, I&rsquo;m carrying around a sweet secret. (39%).</p></blockquote><p>The term <strong>adolescence</strong> refers to the long period of about ten years (10-20) between childhood and adulthood. During this developmental phase, when children mature into independent adults, adolescents, or teenagers, <strong>separate from the parental home</strong>, which usually causes a variety of problems and tensions.</p><p>Although Margot and Peter are in this phase of life, they act in a largely reserved and well-behaved manner due to the extraordinary situation in which they find themselves. Anne thinks that Peter and Margot behave far too maturely and boringly. Even though the adults repeatedly declare them to be role models, Anne is determined never to become so well-behaved and conformist.</p><p>During puberty, <strong>feelings and imagination have a particularly strong influence on thoughts</strong>. Adolescents are troubled by extraordinarily strong feelings, which often makes them appear dogmatic and radical in their views. This intense emotional experience often leads to imbalance, mood swings, or lack of self-control, which manifests itself in a variety of ways: contradictory attitude, distrust, easily irritated character, or stubbornness. Anne reflects on this process in her diary shortly before Christmas 1942:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Oh, I&rsquo;m becoming so sensible! We&rsquo;ve got to be reasonable about everything we do here: studying, listening, holding our tongues, helping others, being kind, making compromises and I don&rsquo;t know what else! I&rsquo;m afraid my common sense, which was in short supply to begin with, will be used up too quickly and I won&rsquo;t have any left by the time the war is over. (23%).</p></blockquote><p>A major point of conflict in this period arises from the adolescents' <strong>need for more freedom</strong>, while parents still want to protect their children from danger. Older adolescents often question the standards of their parents' behavior. Many adolescents experience sexuality and love for the first time during puberty, and this is also Anne's case.</p><h2 id="heading-oygwi" data-guid="581250da-ae5e-4f64-9481-7717e28b58c7">Anne, Margot, and Peter</h2><p><strong>Two generations live together in the secret annex for 25 months</strong> in a very confined space. In 1942, when they move into their hiding place, Anne is thirteen, while Margot and Peter are sixteen years old. The three teenagers can hardly escape being watched by their own parents. This is a challenging situation for the young people, who develop their own identities during this period.</p><p>Especially the pubescent Anne, who is considered less exemplary than her sister and Peter, is <strong>affected by the conflict between generations</strong> arising in the cramped annex. Moreover, the adults constantly criticize her for her behavior.</p><p>Anne <strong>faces numerous self-doubts</strong> while growing up, which she tries to hide from the others. She keeps her true self secret from everyone else. Even at the beginning of her stay in the secret annex, <strong>she feels alienated and isolated from her family</strong>. After a longer period of time, she does not feel truly understood by anyone, not even by her father.</p><p>Anne keeps her feelings secret at first, even as she discovers her own sexuality and her blossoming crush on Peter van Daan. However, being together every day makes it impossible for her to constantly hide her interest in Peter van Daan from her parents.</p><h2 id="heading-c6uv8" data-guid="80a8c61e-7bdd-448c-9c78-782889ab5f98">Anne and her mother</h2><p>During the first months of the hiding period, <strong>Anne is in constant conflict with her mother</strong>. Anne describes in her diary that her and her mother &ldquo;take the opposite view of everything&rdquo; (9%).&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after that, <strong>Anne feels completely alienated from her mother and her sister</strong>: &ldquo;Margot&rsquo;s and Mother&rsquo;s personalities are so alien to me.&rdquo; (12%). Anne's dislike of her mother is so strong that she writes in her diary several times that she does not love her mother and that she &ldquo;can't stand&rdquo; (15%) her. We can certainly interpret these strong statements as <strong>mood swings</strong> experienced by the pubescent girl.</p><p>During this time, Edith Frank-Holl&auml;nder <strong>does not fit Anne's ideal image of a typical mother</strong>. The young girl feels that her mother treats her too harshly and often doesn't take her seriously:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I imagine a mother as a woman who, first and foremost, possesses a great deal of tact, especially toward her adolescent children, and not one who, like Momsy, pokes fun at me when I cry. Not because I&rsquo;m in pain, but because of other things. (47%).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, Anne comes to the conclusion that she has to be a mother to herself and grow up to be a better person on her own.</p><p>After several months, Anne realizes that <strong>she has judged her mother too harshly and subjectively</strong>. She believes that she did not understand her mother, so that they both made each other unhappy.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation was made worse by the fact that they could never get out of each other's way in the secret annex and were never allowed to act out their anger loudly: &ldquo;Those violent outbursts on paper are simply expressions of anger that, in normal life, I could have worked off by locking myself in my room and stamping my foot a few times or calling Mother names behind her back.&rdquo; (47%).</p><h2 id="heading-7tju8" data-guid="c410e8c7-5d4d-44e2-8660-44694eea5280">Anne and her father</h2><p>Anne's father is the only person in the family who provides Anne with a &ldquo;last ounce of family feeling&rdquo; (41%) and by whom she feels understood and loved. However, she never manages to talk to him confidentially without immediately bursting into tears. Since she <strong>loves her father dearly and idealizes him</strong>, she is particularly hurt when she feels that he does not take her side but prefers her sister Margot:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I model myself after Father, and there&rsquo;s no one in the world I love more. He doesn&rsquo;t realize that he treats Margot differently than he does me (&hellip;) I&rsquo;d like to feel that Father really loves me, not because I&rsquo;m his child, but because I&rsquo;m me, Anne. (41%).</p></blockquote><p>When her father asks her to be careful in her dealings with Peter (cf. p. 299) and not to become too intimate with him, Anne <strong>feels that he is restricting her independence</strong>. She writes him a letter in which she reproaches him for not having helped her in her times of grief and loneliness. Now, as a seemingly self-confident girl, she feels no need &ldquo;to account&rdquo; (84%) to her parents but can raise herself: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of me as a fourteen-year-old, since all these troubles have made me older; I won&rsquo;t regret my actions, I&rsquo;ll behave the way I think I should!&rdquo; (84%).</p><p>After a conversation with her father, Anne is ashamed of her letter and realizes that it was not justified to accuse her father in this way. Nevertheless, the stubborn girl does not really take back the opinion she expressed in it. Weeks later, she is still convinced that she has been her own best teacher. Many teenagers tend to <strong>overestimate their abilities</strong>.</p><p>Anne&rsquo;s father had tried to understand Anne, but never treated her as equal, as she would have wished. He cannot become the confidant she would have so desperately wanted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hid any- thing having to do with me from Father, never shared my ideals with him, deliberately alienated myself from him.&rdquo; (98%).</p><h2 id="heading-zrn04" data-guid="920a90a6-bd7c-4a3b-b5bb-6811d6f0b955">Margot and Peter</h2><p>The diary focuses on Anne's conflicts with her parents' generation, but there are indications that Peter and Margot, who are otherwise well-behaved and well-adjusted, <strong>do not always have a harmonious relationship with their respective parents</strong>. For example, Peter wishes he didn't have to see his parents &ldquo;for a year or two&rdquo; (60%) and doesn't think his father is &ldquo;as nice as he looks&rdquo; (60%). Margot also seems increasingly bothered by the everyday presence of her parents in her life: &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine here!

Anne is a pubescent girl who admits in her diary to longing for her first period. She reflects on what happened on January 6, 1944:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eYesterday I read an article on blushing by Sis Heyster. (\u0026hellip;) What she basically says is that during puberty girls withdraw into themselves and begin thinking about the wondrous changes taking place in their bodies. (\u0026hellip;) Whenever I get my period (and that\u0026rsquo;s only been three times), I have the feeling that in spite of all the pain, discomfort and mess, I\u0026rsquo;m carrying around a sweet secret. (39%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe term \u003cstrong\u003eadolescence\u003c/strong\u003e refers to the long period of about ten years (10-20) between childhood and adulthood. During this developmental phase, when children mature into independent adults, adolescents, or teenagers, \u003cstrong\u003eseparate from the parental home\u003c/strong\u003e, which usually causes a variety of problems and tensions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Margot and Peter are in this phase of life, they act in a largely reserved and well-behaved manner due to the extraordinary situation in which they find themselves. Anne thinks that Peter and Margot behave far too maturely and boringly. Even though the adults repeatedly declare them to be role models, Anne is determined never to become so well-behaved and conformist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring puberty, \u003cstrong\u003efeelings and imagination have a particularly strong influence on thoughts\u003c/strong\u003e. Adolescents are troubled by extraordinarily strong feelings, which often makes them appear dogmatic and radical in their views. This intense emotional experience often leads to imbalance, mood swings, or lack of self-control, which manifests itself in a variety of ways: contradictory attitude, distrust, easily irritated character, or stubbornness. Anne reflects on this process in her diary shortly before Christmas 1942:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOh, I\u0026rsquo;m becoming so sensible! We\u0026rsquo;ve got to be reasonable about everything we do here: studying, listening, holding our tongues, helping others, being kind, making compromises and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what else! I\u0026rsquo;m afraid my common sense, which was in short supply to begin with, will be used up too quickly and I won\u0026rsquo;t have any left by the time the war is over. (23%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eA major point of conflict in this period arises from the adolescents\u0027 \u003cstrong\u003eneed for more freedom\u003c/strong\u003e, while parents still want to protect their children from danger. Older adolescents often question the standards of their parents\u0027 behavior. Many adolescents experience sexuality and love for the first time during puberty, and this is also Anne\u0027s case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-oygwi\u0022 data-guid=\u0022581250da-ae5e-4f64-9481-7717e28b58c7\u0022\u003eAnne, Margot, and Peter\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo generations live together in the secret annex for 25 months\u003c/strong\u003e in a very confined space. In 1942, when they move into their hiding place, Anne is thirteen, while Margot and Peter are sixteen years old. The three teenagers can hardly escape being watched by their own parents. This is a challenging situation for the young people, who develop their own identities during this period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEspecially the pubescent Anne, who is considered less exemplary than her sister and Peter, is \u003cstrong\u003eaffected by the conflict between generations\u003c/strong\u003e arising in the cramped annex. Moreover, the adults constantly criticize her for her behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne \u003cstrong\u003efaces numerous self-doubts\u003c/strong\u003e while growing up, which she tries to hide from the others. She keeps her true self secret from everyone else. Even at the beginning of her stay in the secret annex, \u003cstrong\u003eshe feels alienated and isolated from her family\u003c/strong\u003e. After a longer period of time, she does not feel truly understood by anyone, not even by her father.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne keeps her feelings secret at first, even as she discovers her own sexuality and her blossoming crush on Peter van Daan. However, being together every day makes it impossible for her to constantly hide her interest in Peter van Daan from her parents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-c6uv8\u0022 data-guid=\u002280a8c61e-7bdd-448c-9c78-782889ab5f98\u0022\u003eAnne and her mother\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the first months of the hiding period, \u003cstrong\u003eAnne is in constant conflict with her mother\u003c/strong\u003e. Anne describes in her diary that her and her mother \u0026ldquo;take the opposite view of everything\u0026rdquo; (9%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after that, \u003cstrong\u003eAnne feels completely alienated from her mother and her sister\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;Margot\u0026rsquo;s and Mother\u0026rsquo;s personalities are so alien to me.\u0026rdquo; (12%). Anne\u0027s dislike of her mother is so strong that she writes in her diary several times that she does not love her mother and that she \u0026ldquo;can\u0027t stand\u0026rdquo; (15%) her. We can certainly interpret these strong statements as \u003cstrong\u003emood swings\u003c/strong\u003e experienced by the pubescent girl.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, Edith Frank-Holl\u0026auml;nder \u003cstrong\u003edoes not fit Anne\u0027s ideal image of a typical mother\u003c/strong\u003e. The young girl feels that her mother treats her too harshly and often doesn\u0027t take her seriously:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI imagine a mother as a woman who, first and foremost, possesses a great deal of tact, especially toward her adolescent children, and not one who, like Momsy, pokes fun at me when I cry. Not because I\u0026rsquo;m in pain, but because of other things. (47%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eTherefore, Anne comes to the conclusion that she has to be a mother to herself and grow up to be a better person on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter several months, Anne realizes that \u003cstrong\u003eshe has judged her mother too harshly and subjectively\u003c/strong\u003e. She believes that she did not understand her mother, so that they both made each other unhappy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe situation was made worse by the fact that they could never get out of each other\u0027s way in the secret annex and were never allowed to act out their anger loudly: \u0026ldquo;Those violent outbursts on paper are simply expressions of anger that, in normal life, I could have worked off by locking myself in my room and stamping my foot a few times or calling Mother names behind her back.\u0026rdquo; (47%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7tju8\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c410e8c7-5d4d-44e2-8660-44694eea5280\u0022\u003eAnne and her father\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne\u0027s father is the only person in the family who provides Anne with a \u0026ldquo;last ounce of family feeling\u0026rdquo; (41%) and by whom she feels understood and loved. However, she never manages to talk to him confidentially without immediately bursting into tears. Since she \u003cstrong\u003eloves her father dearly and idealizes him\u003c/strong\u003e, she is particularly hurt when she feels that he does not take her side but prefers her sister Margot:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI model myself after Father, and there\u0026rsquo;s no one in the world I love more. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize that he treats Margot differently than he does me (\u0026hellip;) I\u0026rsquo;d like to feel that Father really loves me, not because I\u0026rsquo;m his child, but because I\u0026rsquo;m me, Anne. (41%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen her father asks her to be careful in her dealings with Peter (cf. p. 299) and not to become too intimate with him, Anne \u003cstrong\u003efeels that he is restricting her independence\u003c/strong\u003e. She writes him a letter in which she reproaches him for not having helped her in her times of grief and loneliness. Now, as a seemingly self-confident girl, she feels no need \u0026ldquo;to account\u0026rdquo; (84%) to her parents but can raise herself: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t think of me as a fourteen-year-old, since all these troubles have made me older; I won\u0026rsquo;t regret my actions, I\u0026rsquo;ll behave the way I think I should!\u0026rdquo; (84%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a conversation with her father, Anne is ashamed of her letter and realizes that it was not justified to accuse her father in this way. Nevertheless, the stubborn girl does not really take back the opinion she expressed in it. Weeks later, she is still convinced that she has been her own best teacher. Many teenagers tend to \u003cstrong\u003eoverestimate their abilities\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne\u0026rsquo;s father had tried to understand Anne, but never treated her as equal, as she would have wished. He cannot become the confidant she would have so desperately wanted: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve hid any- thing having to do with me from Father, never shared my ideals with him, deliberately alienated myself from him.\u0026rdquo; (98%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-zrn04\u0022 data-guid=\u0022920a90a6-bd7c-4a3b-b5bb-6811d6f0b955\u0022\u003eMargot and Peter\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe diary focuses on Anne\u0027s conflicts with her parents\u0027 generation, but there are indications that Peter and Margot, who are otherwise well-behaved and well-adjusted, \u003cstrong\u003edo not always have a harmonious relationship with their respective parents\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, Peter wishes he didn\u0027t have to see his parents \u0026ldquo;for a year or two\u0026rdquo; (60%) and doesn\u0027t think his father is \u0026ldquo;as nice as he looks\u0026rdquo; (60%). Margot also seems increasingly bothered by the everyday presence of her parents in her life: \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rsquo;s fine here! Except that Margot and I are rather tired of our parents.\u0026rdquo; (66%).\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Jurnalul Annei Frank | Conflict between generations","MetaDescription":"The term puberty describes a period of about four years (10-14) during which physical changes transform a child\u0027s body into an adult\u0027s body enabling them to reproduce.
