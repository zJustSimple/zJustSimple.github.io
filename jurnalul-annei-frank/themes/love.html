She was well aware of the attention of the boys: &ldquo;I have a throng of admirers who can&rsquo;t keep their adoring eyes off me and who sometimes have to resort to using a broken pocket mirror to try and catch a glimpse of me in the classroom.&rdquo; (2%).&nbsp;</p><p>Anne even goes so far as to state that almost every boy who accompanies her home only once immediately &ldquo;become[s] enamored on the spot&rdquo; (6%) and never takes his eyes off her again.</p><p>However, Anne does not respond to any of the advances. As soon as a boy becomes too pushy for her, she bluntly refuses him:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Of course, there are those who blow you kisses or try to take hold of your arm, but they&rsquo;re definitely knocking on the wrong door. I get off my bike and either refuse to make further use of their company or act as if I&rsquo;m insulted and tell them in no uncertain terms to go on home without me. (3%).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Nevertheless, <strong>she feels flattered by the attention she is given</strong>. Only when the already sixteen-year-old Hello Silberberg tries to get Anne's attention is she more inclined to get to know him better. She even introduces him to her parents and finds it &ldquo;kind of nice for a change&rdquo; (4%) that someone is in love with her. However, she does not return his feelings.</p><p>Anne is in love with her former childhood crush Peter Schiff, but always denies her affection for him vigorously. She was inseparable from the slightly older Peter Schiff &ldquo;for one whole summer&rdquo; (48%), until he thought her too childish and preferred to date girls his own age. Anne was gripped by such an &ldquo;out-and-out crush&rdquo; (48%) for him that she still chased after him for a while.</p><p>Anne is thirteen years old when she moves into the secret annex with her parents. She is in the middle of puberty and begins to think more about her own body and the subject of sexuality. She can hardly wait to finally get her period, which seems to her to be an extremely important step towards adulthood.&nbsp;</p><p>A year and a half later, she is ashamed of having written so &ldquo;openly&rdquo; (18%) about intimate topics. However, <strong>her interest in the changes in her body persists</strong> and even though she is embarrassed to discuss them with anyone, she shares them with her diary:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I think that what&rsquo;s happening to me is so wonderful, and I don&rsquo;t just mean the changes taking place on the outside of my body, but also those on the inside. I never discuss myself or any of these things with others, which is why I have to talk about them to myself. (48%).</p></blockquote><p>Anne`s own physical development is accompanied by an interest in that of the opposite sex. When she has a dream about her childhood love Peter Schiff, her interest in getting closer with Peter van Daan awakens. Since her dream, it seems to her that she has become older and more independent. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-9rj8l" data-guid="65429004-1da5-4c05-825a-7fd4fc331a4d">The conquest of Peter van Daan</h2><p>As Anne seeks out the company of Peter van Daan more and more often, her friendly feelings toward him turn into a romanticized desire. She starts thinking about him in every free minute: &ldquo;From early in the morning to late at night, all I do is think about Peter. I fall asleep with his image before my eyes, dream about him and wake up with him still looking at me.&rdquo; (59%).&nbsp;</p><p>The idealized childhood love for Peter Schiff merges with the real and available Peter van Daan and Anne feels a great longing for him.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Anne describes herself as &ldquo;someone who&rsquo;s in love and can talk about nothing but her dearest darling&rdquo; (61%). The conquest of Peter van Daan becomes Anne's main goal in the secret annex.&nbsp; She <strong>experiences a phase of excitement</strong> that sweetens her dull everyday life: &ldquo;so I think I should tell you that I live from one encounter to the next.&rdquo; (61%). She constantly longs for his closeness and wishes to be kissed by him.</p><p>At the same time, Anne's phase of being in love is characterized by many <strong>insecurities</strong>. She doesn't want to give the impression of constantly chasing after Peter and tries to suppress her desire outwardly as best she can. The questions of what Peter really thinks about her and how he feels about her, however, preoccupy her every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Peter, as a boy, would be socially designated to make the first move, Anne doubts that he would be brave enough to take the initiative: &ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know how to begin, I really don&rsquo;t, so how can I expect Peter to when talking is so much harder for him?&rdquo; (65%). Therefore, she continues to visit him in his room as often as possible.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Anne and Peter become closer and closer. She talks extensively about sexuality with the older and more sexually enlightened Peter. The two of them talk about the most intimate topics regarding their development in the secret annex, their relationship with their parents, about trust and feelings, about &ldquo;doing things your own way, the diary, loneliness, the difference between everyone&rsquo;s inner and outer selves, my mask, etc.&rdquo; (64%).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anne confides things to Peter that she tells no one else</strong>. She feels she can be who she really is in his presence and even thinks about marrying Peter one day. While falling in love, Anne admires Peter and appreciates all his qualities. As Anne and Peter also get closer physically, the next height of their relationship is reached: &ldquo;Remember yesterday&rsquo;s date, since it was a red-letter day for me. Isn&rsquo;t it an important day for every girl when she gets her first kiss?&rdquo; (79%).</p><p>Anne is extremely happy after Peter has held her in his arms for an entire evening and kissed her on the head as a farewell. Her longing for him is heightened after this first approach. She feels safe in his arms and has the feeling that he succeeds in bringing out her inner side: &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s reached a part of me that no one has ever reached before, except in my dream!&rdquo; (82%).</p><p>After Anne and Peter kiss each other on the mouth, Anne doubts whether it is morally acceptable to approach a boy in this manner when she is only fourteen years old. Although she believes her loneliness in the secret annex justifies her behavior, she decides to tell her parents about her new intimacy with Peter. However, shortly after Anne passionately pleads to continue to be close to Peter despite her father`s concerns, her desire for him fades away on its own.</p><h2 id="heading-ag7xr" data-guid="441166f9-ebf1-426d-b3a7-cb35de5da60b">Disappointment with Peter</h2><p>After Anne's &ldquo;laborious conquest&rdquo;, she no longer reveals her true self to Peter, but <strong>starts withdrawing into herself again</strong>: &ldquo;if ever he wants to force the lock again, he'll have to use a harder crowbar!&rdquo; (89%). Peter does not turn out to be the confidant Anne had so eagerly hoped for. She has the feeling that he is hiding his inner self from her.</p><p>As <strong>Anne's infatuation phase wears off</strong>, she no longer idealizes Peter, but becomes aware of his character flaws: &ldquo;Peter is kind and good, and yet I can&rsquo;t deny that he&rsquo;s disappointed me in many ways. I especially don&rsquo;t care for his dislike of religion, his table conversations and various things of that nature.&rdquo; (94%). She cannot understand why Peter does not want to improve his &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; (96%). It bothers her that he is too comfortable to work on himself and that he has no goal in life.</p><p>The more Anne pays attention to Peter's character weaknesses, the more she feels as if he is leaning on her. Shortly after their most intense episode in their relationship, Anne looks back critically on the intimacies exchanged between them.&nbsp;</p><p>Anne realizes that <strong>she created an ideal image of Peter</strong> and became interested in him mainly because she longed for intimacy. She regrets using &ldquo;intimacy to get closer to Peter&rdquo; (98%) instead of keeping their relationship on a friendly basis. For now, she does not know how to escape Peter's constant need for love and affection: &ldquo;I forced Peter, more than he realizes, to get close to me, and now he&rsquo;s holding on for dear life.

As soon as a boy becomes too pushy for her, she bluntly refuses him:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are those who blow you kisses or try to take hold of your arm, but they\u0026rsquo;re definitely knocking on the wrong door. I get off my bike and either refuse to make further use of their company or act as if I\u0026rsquo;m insulted and tell them in no uncertain terms to go on home without me. (3%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, \u003cstrong\u003eshe feels flattered by the attention she is given\u003c/strong\u003e. Only when the already sixteen-year-old Hello Silberberg tries to get Anne\u0027s attention is she more inclined to get to know him better. She even introduces him to her parents and finds it \u0026ldquo;kind of nice for a change\u0026rdquo; (4%) that someone is in love with her. However, she does not return his feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne is in love with her former childhood crush Peter Schiff, but always denies her affection for him vigorously. She was inseparable from the slightly older Peter Schiff \u0026ldquo;for one whole summer\u0026rdquo; (48%), until he thought her too childish and preferred to date girls his own age. Anne was gripped by such an \u0026ldquo;out-and-out crush\u0026rdquo; (48%) for him that she still chased after him for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne is thirteen years old when she moves into the secret annex with her parents. She is in the middle of puberty and begins to think more about her own body and the subject of sexuality. She can hardly wait to finally get her period, which seems to her to be an extremely important step towards adulthood.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA year and a half later, she is ashamed of having written so \u0026ldquo;openly\u0026rdquo; (18%) about intimate topics. However, \u003cstrong\u003eher interest in the changes in her body persists\u003c/strong\u003e and even though she is embarrassed to discuss them with anyone, she shares them with her diary:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that what\u0026rsquo;s happening to me is so wonderful, and I don\u0026rsquo;t just mean the changes taking place on the outside of my body, but also those on the inside. I never discuss myself or any of these things with others, which is why I have to talk about them to myself. (48%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne`s own physical development is accompanied by an interest in that of the opposite sex. When she has a dream about her childhood love Peter Schiff, her interest in getting closer with Peter van Daan awakens. Since her dream, it seems to her that she has become older and more independent. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-9rj8l\u0022 data-guid=\u002265429004-1da5-4c05-825a-7fd4fc331a4d\u0022\u003eThe conquest of Peter van Daan\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Anne seeks out the company of Peter van Daan more and more often, her friendly feelings toward him turn into a romanticized desire. She starts thinking about him in every free minute: \u0026ldquo;From early in the morning to late at night, all I do is think about Peter. I fall asleep with his image before my eyes, dream about him and wake up with him still looking at me.\u0026rdquo; (59%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idealized childhood love for Peter Schiff merges with the real and available Peter van Daan and Anne feels a great longing for him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly afterwards, Anne describes herself as \u0026ldquo;someone who\u0026rsquo;s in love and can talk about nothing but her dearest darling\u0026rdquo; (61%). The conquest of Peter van Daan becomes Anne\u0027s main goal in the secret annex.\u0026nbsp; She \u003cstrong\u003eexperiences a phase of excitement\u003c/strong\u003e that sweetens her dull everyday life: \u0026ldquo;so I think I should tell you that I live from one encounter to the next.\u0026rdquo; (61%). She constantly longs for his closeness and wishes to be kissed by him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Anne\u0027s phase of being in love is characterized by many \u003cstrong\u003einsecurities\u003c/strong\u003e. She doesn\u0027t want to give the impression of constantly chasing after Peter and tries to suppress her desire outwardly as best she can. The questions of what Peter really thinks about her and how he feels about her, however, preoccupy her every day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Peter, as a boy, would be socially designated to make the first move, Anne doubts that he would be brave enough to take the initiative: \u0026ldquo;I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t know how to begin, I really don\u0026rsquo;t, so how can I expect Peter to when talking is so much harder for him?\u0026rdquo; (65%). Therefore, she continues to visit him in his room as often as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the next few weeks, Anne and Peter become closer and closer. She talks extensively about sexuality with the older and more sexually enlightened Peter. The two of them talk about the most intimate topics regarding their development in the secret annex, their relationship with their parents, about trust and feelings, about \u0026ldquo;doing things your own way, the diary, loneliness, the difference between everyone\u0026rsquo;s inner and outer selves, my mask, etc.\u0026rdquo; (64%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne confides things to Peter that she tells no one else\u003c/strong\u003e. She feels she can be who she really is in his presence and even thinks about marrying Peter one day. While falling in love, Anne admires Peter and appreciates all his qualities. As Anne and Peter also get closer physically, the next height of their relationship is reached: \u0026ldquo;Remember yesterday\u0026rsquo;s date, since it was a red-letter day for me. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it an important day for every girl when she gets her first kiss?\u0026rdquo; (79%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne is extremely happy after Peter has held her in his arms for an entire evening and kissed her on the head as a farewell. Her longing for him is heightened after this first approach. She feels safe in his arms and has the feeling that he succeeds in bringing out her inner side: \u0026ldquo;Peter\u0026rsquo;s reached a part of me that no one has ever reached before, except in my dream!\u0026rdquo; (82%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Anne and Peter kiss each other on the mouth, Anne doubts whether it is morally acceptable to approach a boy in this manner when she is only fourteen years old. Although she believes her loneliness in the secret annex justifies her behavior, she decides to tell her parents about her new intimacy with Peter. However, shortly after Anne passionately pleads to continue to be close to Peter despite her father`s concerns, her desire for him fades away on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ag7xr\u0022 data-guid=\u0022441166f9-ebf1-426d-b3a7-cb35de5da60b\u0022\u003eDisappointment with Peter\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Anne\u0027s \u0026ldquo;laborious conquest\u0026rdquo;, she no longer reveals her true self to Peter, but \u003cstrong\u003estarts withdrawing into herself again\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;if ever he wants to force the lock again, he\u0027ll have to use a harder crowbar!\u0026rdquo; (89%). Peter does not turn out to be the confidant Anne had so eagerly hoped for. She has the feeling that he is hiding his inner self from her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs \u003cstrong\u003eAnne\u0027s infatuation phase wears off\u003c/strong\u003e, she no longer idealizes Peter, but becomes aware of his character flaws: \u0026ldquo;Peter is kind and good, and yet I can\u0026rsquo;t deny that he\u0026rsquo;s disappointed me in many ways. I especially don\u0026rsquo;t care for his dislike of religion, his table conversations and various things of that nature.\u0026rdquo; (94%). She cannot understand why Peter does not want to improve his \u0026ldquo;weakness\u0026rdquo; (96%). It bothers her that he is too comfortable to work on himself and that he has no goal in life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe more Anne pays attention to Peter\u0027s character weaknesses, the more she feels as if he is leaning on her. Shortly after their most intense episode in their relationship, Anne looks back critically on the intimacies exchanged between them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnne realizes that \u003cstrong\u003eshe created an ideal image of Peter\u003c/strong\u003e and became interested in him mainly because she longed for intimacy. She regrets using \u0026ldquo;intimacy to get closer to Peter\u0026rdquo; (98%) instead of keeping their relationship on a friendly basis. For now, she does not know how to escape Peter\u0027s constant need for love and affection: \u0026ldquo;I forced Peter, more than he realizes, to get close to me, and now he\u0026rsquo;s holding on for dear life. I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t see any effective way of shaking him off and getting him back on his own two feet.\u0026rdquo; (98%).\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Jurnalul Annei Frank | Love","MetaDescription":"Anne reports in her diary that before the family goes into hiding in the secret annex, she was admired by many boys in her class.
