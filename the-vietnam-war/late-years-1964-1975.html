North Vietnam sent personnel, equipment, and other supplies to the Viet Cong, tasking them with capturing key areas in the South and weakening the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.</p><p>On 6th and 7th of February, 1965, approximately 300 Viet Cong soldiers attacked a US helicopter facility located in South Vietnam. They achieved victory by destroying 10 aircrafts and damaging 15 more. The attack killed eight US soldiers and wounded another 126. Just 12 hours after the attack, Lyndon B. Johnson started <strong>Operation Flaming Dart</strong> to bomb North Vietnamese targets. The bombing campaign was intended to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam.</p><p>Operation Flaming Dart was conducted in two parts. The first part consisted of attacks on North Vietnamese army bases and Viet Cong logistics and communications near the Demilitarised Zone. After a retaliatory attack from the Viet Cong on a hotel hosting US personnel, the second part of the Operation Flaming Dart commenced, where the US Navy launched 99 fighter-bombers to attack enemy bases. However, after the operation, <strong>the Soviet government decided to increase their military aid to North Vietnam</strong>, because Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin was on a state visit to Hanoi during the bombing and because they intended to counteract Chinese influence in the region.</p><p>Operation Flaming Dart was later followed by <strong>Operation Rolling Thunder</strong> which began on 2nd of March, 1965 and lasted almost 4 years. The objectives of the operation were to force North Vietnam to cease its support for the Viet Cong&nbsp;and to destroy North Vietnam's infrastructure, industrial base, and military units. The operation was additionally aimed at boosting the morale of the South Vietnamese army and government. Rolling Thunder was the most intense battle waged during the Cold War period.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="0dd60839-1715-4c1a-a3a4-ed235b8d150a">Ground war and escalation of US involvement</h2><p>On 8th of March, 1965, 3,500 US Marines were dispatched to South Vietnam with defence as their initial assignment. However, the number of US troops increased to nearly 200,000 by December 1965. As American forces were mainly trained for offensive warfare, General William Westmoreland advocated for a <strong>more aggressive approach</strong>. He proposed the commitment of more US troops to mount major offensive actions against both guerrilla units and organised enemy forces. He adopted a strategy of attrition, attempting to drain the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army of manpower and supplies.</p><p>The plan was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson. However, he did not communicate this change in strategy to the media, as he was&nbsp;trying to<strong> hide the escalation of US involvement</strong> in the Vietnam War from the public.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand agreed to send troops to aid the South Vietnamese war effort in exchange for payment from the United States. The US and its allies mounted complex search and destroy operations, designed to find enemy forces, destroy them, and then withdraw. However, the communist insurgents were often difficult to find&nbsp;and demonstrated great tactical flexibility.</p><p>United States forces and Army of the Republic of Vietnam troops made use of <strong>chemical defoliants</strong>. These were military herbicides used to clear forests to prevent enemy troops from hiding and to make bombing targets more visible, or to destroy enemy crops in an attempt to starve the soldiers. The most widely used defoliant was <strong>Agent Orange</strong>. In addition to its damaging environmental effects, the chemical was later proved to have caused major health problems for the people who were exposed to it. Between 2 to 4 million people have been exposed to Agent Orange and other defoliants in Vietnam and the aftereffects are still visible today. However, at that time, the full health risks of the substance were not widely known.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="35c0ee41-d48c-4dee-b244-3cbd65717980">Anti-war movement</h2><p>The use of<strong> napalm</strong> also increased during military actions in the Vietnam War. The US Air Force and Navy made use of it for its tactical and psychological effects. Although it was known that napalm had&nbsp;been used in other wars, like the Korean War, its effects had never been widely observed by the general public. Due to the media coverage of the Vietnam War, the public began to frown upon the use of napalm, and anti-war protesters called for a boycott of the company producing napalm for the US military.</p><p>The Vietnam War became <strong>the first televised war</strong> and it produced some of the most dramatic television footage up to that point. Pictures of injured US soldiers were being shown on the news, as well as videos capturing the suffering of the Vietnamese civilian population. Some of these images became a topic of international controversy, and television commentators brought harsh criticisms to the Johnson Administration.&nbsp;Reports on the use of chemical warfare, the bombing campaigns, and the mass killings of innocent civilians caused the population to view the Vietnam War as unjustifiable and immoral.</p><p>Furthermore, the Johnson Administration disclosed less about the progression of the Vietnam War to the media, emphasizing stories that showed US success in the war. Over time, this policy damaged public trust in officials and a so-called <strong>credibility gap</strong> developed. In October 1967, around 35,000 people took part in a Vietnam War protest outside the Pentagon, arguing that civilians were the primary victims of the war.</p><p>Unrest was also beginning to take over the army. By November 1967, the number of US troops in Vietnam was approaching 500,000, with tens of thousands suffering&nbsp;casualties. As the war stretched on, some soldiers came to mistrust the government&rsquo;s reasons for keeping them there, as well as the official reports that the war would end soon.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="2d3140ec-95d4-4b6d-b8c6-cb716864ebdf">Tet Offensive</h2><p>In 1967, the North Vietnamese People&rsquo;s Army of Vietnam began to develop a strategy meant to draw the forces of the United States and its allies towards the remote border regions, hoping to&nbsp;leave them vulnerable to attack. This plan was part of a larger military campaign of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong known as the <strong>Tet Offensive</strong>.</p><p>The Tet Offensive began on 30th of January, 1968. Over 100 cities, military headquarters, and government buildings in South Vietnam were attacked by more than 80,000 enemy troops. The North Vietnamese government launched the offensive in <strong>the belief that it would trigger a popular uprising</strong> leading to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. However, the uprising never materialized.</p><p>Nonetheless, the initial attacks came as a surprise to both the United States and South Vietnamese armies and, since they were unprepared, they temporarily lost control of several cities. But they quickly recovered and recaptured most cities within weeks.</p><p>The longest conflict in the campaign was <strong>the Battle of Hue</strong>, which lasted one month and ended with the defeat of the communist forces, the destruction of almost the entire&nbsp;city, and the massacre of a large number of its population at the hand of the communists. After the Tet Offensive, the People&rsquo;s Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong organised two more offensive attacks in South Vietnam in May and August 1968. Both offensives ended in the defeat of the PAVN and the Viet Cong.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="eb591284-9b9a-4476-bbaf-6b708a2dc03f"><strong>My </strong>Lai M<strong>assacre</strong></h2><p>After the first attack of the Tet Offensive, the US military suspected that a battalion of the Viet Cong had taken refuge in the village of Son My, located in South&nbsp;Vietnam. A search-and-destroy operation was, therefore, issued to a US military unit, who entered the village on 16th March 1968 and killed between 350 and 500 unarmed civilians. The event is known as the My Lai Massacre. A US helicopter crew that was flying over the village witnessed the massacre and intervened, bringing some of the villagers to safety and reporting the incident to their superiors. The event was initially kept secret from the press, and official reports presented the attack on the village as a fight against Viet Cong troops which resulted in the death of 128 enemy combatants. However, the massacre and other atrocities committed by US troops became public knowledge by the end of 1969 and stirred global outrage.</p><p>The My Lai Massacre and the Tet Offensive had a major impact on the way the Vietnam War was perceived by the public. The events came as a shock to the population, as President Johnson and General Westmoreland were shown to have been over-optimistic about the outcome of the war.</p><p>These&nbsp;events&nbsp;<strong>furthered the credibility gap</strong>, proving that victory in Vietnam was not imminent and weakened public support for the Johnson Administration. Westmoreland was removed from command and Johnson agreed to take part in a series of peace talks in Paris. He ordered the halt of bombings in North Vietnam and decided not to run for re-election. He was succeeded in 1969 by <strong>Richard Nixon</strong>.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="a7199457-9369-4d69-b005-982d606dca95">US withdrawal</h2><p>Due to the increasing unpopularity of the war&nbsp;Richard Nixon continued to take part in peace talks and began to withdraw US troops from Vietnam in 1969. His plan, called <strong>the Nixon Doctrine</strong>, was to increase the strength of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, so it would be able to take over the defence of South Vietnam. The policy became known as <strong>Vietnamization</strong>. The United States increased aerial and artillery bombardment and gave the South Vietnamese the training and weapons needed to effectively control the ground war.</p><p>However, anti-war movements continued and protests were increasingly popular among young people. The <strong>US troops also suffered from low morale, desertion, and insubordination</strong>.</p><p>In 1970, US troops intervened in Cambodia after a North Vietnamese invasion&nbsp;and stirred another international controversy. This intervention sparked <strong>nationwide protests</strong> in the United States, as people wanted Nixon to deescalate the American involvement in the war. Four students were killed at Kent State University during a protest after the Ohio Army National Guard opened fire on an unarmed crowd, causing further public outrage. Requirements to join the army&nbsp;were ended in 1972, as many American men were fleeing the country&nbsp;to avoid joining the army.</p><p>North Vietnam was also experiencing a change in policy as <strong>Ho Chi Minh died</strong> in 1969. Between March and October 1972, the People&rsquo;s Army of Vietnam led an offensive known as the <strong>Easter Offensive</strong> against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the remaining US forces.

North Vietnam sent personnel, equipment, and other supplies to the Viet Cong, tasking them with capturing key areas in the South and weakening the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 6th and 7th of February, 1965, approximately 300 Viet Cong soldiers attacked a US helicopter facility located in South Vietnam. They achieved victory by destroying 10 aircrafts and damaging 15 more. The attack killed eight US soldiers and wounded another 126. Just 12 hours after the attack, Lyndon B. Johnson started \u003cstrong\u003eOperation Flaming Dart\u003c/strong\u003e to bomb North Vietnamese targets. The bombing campaign was intended to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOperation Flaming Dart was conducted in two parts. The first part consisted of attacks on North Vietnamese army bases and Viet Cong logistics and communications near the Demilitarised Zone. After a retaliatory attack from the Viet Cong on a hotel hosting US personnel, the second part of the Operation Flaming Dart commenced, where the US Navy launched 99 fighter-bombers to attack enemy bases. However, after the operation, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Soviet government decided to increase their military aid to North Vietnam\u003c/strong\u003e, because Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin was on a state visit to Hanoi during the bombing and because they intended to counteract Chinese influence in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOperation Flaming Dart was later followed by \u003cstrong\u003eOperation Rolling Thunder\u003c/strong\u003e which began on 2nd of March, 1965 and lasted almost 4 years. The objectives of the operation were to force North Vietnam to cease its support for the Viet Cong\u0026nbsp;and to destroy North Vietnam\u0027s infrastructure, industrial base, and military units. The operation was additionally aimed at boosting the morale of the South Vietnamese army and government. Rolling Thunder was the most intense battle waged during the Cold War period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00220dd60839-1715-4c1a-a3a4-ed235b8d150a\u0022\u003eGround war and escalation of US involvement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 8th of March, 1965, 3,500 US Marines were dispatched to South Vietnam with defence as their initial assignment. However, the number of US troops increased to nearly 200,000 by December 1965. As American forces were mainly trained for offensive warfare, General William Westmoreland advocated for a \u003cstrong\u003emore aggressive approach\u003c/strong\u003e. He proposed the commitment of more US troops to mount major offensive actions against both guerrilla units and organised enemy forces. He adopted a strategy of attrition, attempting to drain the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army of manpower and supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe plan was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson. However, he did not communicate this change in strategy to the media, as he was\u0026nbsp;trying to\u003cstrong\u003e hide the escalation of US involvement\u003c/strong\u003e in the Vietnam War from the public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAustralia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand agreed to send troops to aid the South Vietnamese war effort in exchange for payment from the United States. The US and its allies mounted complex search and destroy operations, designed to find enemy forces, destroy them, and then withdraw. However, the communist insurgents were often difficult to find\u0026nbsp;and demonstrated great tactical flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnited States forces and Army of the Republic of Vietnam troops made use of \u003cstrong\u003echemical defoliants\u003c/strong\u003e. These were military herbicides used to clear forests to prevent enemy troops from hiding and to make bombing targets more visible, or to destroy enemy crops in an attempt to starve the soldiers. The most widely used defoliant was \u003cstrong\u003eAgent Orange\u003c/strong\u003e. In addition to its damaging environmental effects, the chemical was later proved to have caused major health problems for the people who were exposed to it. Between 2 to 4 million people have been exposed to Agent Orange and other defoliants in Vietnam and the aftereffects are still visible today. However, at that time, the full health risks of the substance were not widely known.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002235c0ee41-d48c-4dee-b244-3cbd65717980\u0022\u003eAnti-war movement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe use of\u003cstrong\u003e napalm\u003c/strong\u003e also increased during military actions in the Vietnam War. The US Air Force and Navy made use of it for its tactical and psychological effects. Although it was known that napalm had\u0026nbsp;been used in other wars, like the Korean War, its effects had never been widely observed by the general public. Due to the media coverage of the Vietnam War, the public began to frown upon the use of napalm, and anti-war protesters called for a boycott of the company producing napalm for the US military.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Vietnam War became \u003cstrong\u003ethe first televised war\u003c/strong\u003e and it produced some of the most dramatic television footage up to that point. Pictures of injured US soldiers were being shown on the news, as well as videos capturing the suffering of the Vietnamese civilian population. Some of these images became a topic of international controversy, and television commentators brought harsh criticisms to the Johnson Administration.\u0026nbsp;Reports on the use of chemical warfare, the bombing campaigns, and the mass killings of innocent civilians caused the population to view the Vietnam War as unjustifiable and immoral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Johnson Administration disclosed less about the progression of the Vietnam War to the media, emphasizing stories that showed US success in the war. Over time, this policy damaged public trust in officials and a so-called \u003cstrong\u003ecredibility gap\u003c/strong\u003e developed. In October 1967, around 35,000 people took part in a Vietnam War protest outside the Pentagon, arguing that civilians were the primary victims of the war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnrest was also beginning to take over the army. By November 1967, the number of US troops in Vietnam was approaching 500,000, with tens of thousands suffering\u0026nbsp;casualties. As the war stretched on, some soldiers came to mistrust the government\u0026rsquo;s reasons for keeping them there, as well as the official reports that the war would end soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u00222d3140ec-95d4-4b6d-b8c6-cb716864ebdf\u0022\u003eTet Offensive\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1967, the North Vietnamese People\u0026rsquo;s Army of Vietnam began to develop a strategy meant to draw the forces of the United States and its allies towards the remote border regions, hoping to\u0026nbsp;leave them vulnerable to attack. This plan was part of a larger military campaign of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong known as the \u003cstrong\u003eTet Offensive\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Tet Offensive began on 30th of January, 1968. Over 100 cities, military headquarters, and government buildings in South Vietnam were attacked by more than 80,000 enemy troops. The North Vietnamese government launched the offensive in \u003cstrong\u003ethe belief that it would trigger a popular uprising\u003c/strong\u003e leading to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. However, the uprising never materialized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, the initial attacks came as a surprise to both the United States and South Vietnamese armies and, since they were unprepared, they temporarily lost control of several cities. But they quickly recovered and recaptured most cities within weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe longest conflict in the campaign was \u003cstrong\u003ethe Battle of Hue\u003c/strong\u003e, which lasted one month and ended with the defeat of the communist forces, the destruction of almost the entire\u0026nbsp;city, and the massacre of a large number of its population at the hand of the communists. After the Tet Offensive, the People\u0026rsquo;s Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong organised two more offensive attacks in South Vietnam in May and August 1968. Both offensives ended in the defeat of the PAVN and the Viet Cong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022eb591284-9b9a-4476-bbaf-6b708a2dc03f\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy \u003c/strong\u003eLai M\u003cstrong\u003eassacre\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the first attack of the Tet Offensive, the US military suspected that a battalion of the Viet Cong had taken refuge in the village of Son My, located in South\u0026nbsp;Vietnam. A search-and-destroy operation was, therefore, issued to a US military unit, who entered the village on 16th March 1968 and killed between 350 and 500 unarmed civilians. The event is known as the My Lai Massacre. A US helicopter crew that was flying over the village witnessed the massacre and intervened, bringing some of the villagers to safety and reporting the incident to their superiors. The event was initially kept secret from the press, and official reports presented the attack on the village as a fight against Viet Cong troops which resulted in the death of 128 enemy combatants. However, the massacre and other atrocities committed by US troops became public knowledge by the end of 1969 and stirred global outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe My Lai Massacre and the Tet Offensive had a major impact on the way the Vietnam War was perceived by the public. The events came as a shock to the population, as President Johnson and General Westmoreland were shown to have been over-optimistic about the outcome of the war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese\u0026nbsp;events\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003efurthered the credibility gap\u003c/strong\u003e, proving that victory in Vietnam was not imminent and weakened public support for the Johnson Administration. Westmoreland was removed from command and Johnson agreed to take part in a series of peace talks in Paris. He ordered the halt of bombings in North Vietnam and decided not to run for re-election. He was succeeded in 1969 by \u003cstrong\u003eRichard Nixon\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a7199457-9369-4d69-b005-982d606dca95\u0022\u003eUS withdrawal\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDue to the increasing unpopularity of the war\u0026nbsp;Richard Nixon continued to take part in peace talks and began to withdraw US troops from Vietnam in 1969. His plan, called \u003cstrong\u003ethe Nixon Doctrine\u003c/strong\u003e, was to increase the strength of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, so it would be able to take over the defence of South Vietnam. The policy became known as \u003cstrong\u003eVietnamization\u003c/strong\u003e. The United States increased aerial and artillery bombardment and gave the South Vietnamese the training and weapons needed to effectively control the ground war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, anti-war movements continued and protests were increasingly popular among young people. The \u003cstrong\u003eUS troops also suffered from low morale, desertion, and insubordination\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1970, US troops intervened in Cambodia after a North Vietnamese invasion\u0026nbsp;and stirred another international controversy. This intervention sparked \u003cstrong\u003enationwide protests\u003c/strong\u003e in the United States, as people wanted Nixon to deescalate the American involvement in the war. Four students were killed at Kent State University during a protest after the Ohio Army National Guard opened fire on an unarmed crowd, causing further public outrage. Requirements to join the army\u0026nbsp;were ended in 1972, as many American men were fleeing the country\u0026nbsp;to avoid joining the army.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNorth Vietnam was also experiencing a change in policy as \u003cstrong\u003eHo Chi Minh died\u003c/strong\u003e in 1969. Between March and October 1972, the People\u0026rsquo;s Army of Vietnam led an offensive known as the \u003cstrong\u003eEaster Offensive\u003c/strong\u003e against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the remaining US forces. Their plan was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the ARVN as possible, to improve North Vietnam\u0026rsquo;s position in the negotiations of the Paris Peace Accords.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Late years of the Vietnam War (1964-1975)","MetaDescription":"Anticipating the arrival of even more US troops in South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese government began lending more aid to the communist insurgency in the South.
