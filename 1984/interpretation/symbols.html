He shows up in various ways&nbsp;throughout the story, even though we never meet him in person and it is doubtful whether he actually exists.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Big Brother is a symbol of the Party and its complete control of the people. In the minds of the citizens, he is often associated with positive qualities. He appears as protector, always appearing as a reassuring figure at the end of Hate videos or news about war, promising safety from the states&rsquo; enemies. We see a clear example of this in the beginning of the book, when the employees at the Ministry of Truth react to his appearance on-screen:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&hellip;drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio&rsquo;d, full of power and mysterious calm [&hellip;] Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement [&hellip;] restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. (p. 18)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">As Goldstein book points out, Big Brother&rsquo;s name is no coincidence. By using a term that normally describes a close family member, his name is designed to inspire love and dedication. On a darker level, it also implies that this love is meant to replace the personal love that people might have felt for their own family members: &ldquo;[The Party] systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty&rdquo; (p. 225).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Big Brother also serves as a symbol of the state&rsquo;s constant surveillance of its people. This is shown in the design of the ever-present posters of him: &ldquo;It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran"&nbsp;(p. 3). The posters are meant to remind the citizens of the fact that they are being watched, to keep them in line at all times. Big Brother&rsquo;s frequent appearance on the telescreens probably has a similar effect, as citizens are well-aware that the screens are being used to spy on everybody. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-guid="8de4e0e1-c87f-4a96-ba7d-e40093dd7b84" id="heading-mnk0i">&ldquo;Oranges and Lemons&rdquo;</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The old British nursery rhyme &ldquo;Oranges and Lemons&rdquo; plays a significant role in the story, as Winston gradually tracks down its lines.</span></p><p><span style="color:#0075e3;">You can read the full text of the rhyme here</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#222222;">The symbolism of this rhyme has several different layers. For most of the book, Winston&rsquo;s efforts to track down the entire poem represents his fascination with the past before the Party, and the image of a London free from their control. The rhyme therefore seems to symbolise something&nbsp;<strong>beautiful and nostalgic</strong>&nbsp;in the early sections of the story:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. (p. 103)</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;">However, the final section of the rhyme takes a much&nbsp;<strong>darker turn</strong>, with its direct references to death and execution. When Winston first hears these lines from Mr. Charrington, he does not pay special attention to them, but they serve as&nbsp;<strong>foreshadowing</strong>&nbsp;of Charrington&rsquo;s later betrayal. This is made completely clear when Charrington repeats the lines in the scene when Winston and Julia are finally caught (p. 231). This points to how the Party has taken something innocent like a children&rsquo;s rhyme and turned it into a form of psychological manipulation and entrapment.</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;">In some ways, the symbolism of the rhyme reflects Mr. Charrington&rsquo;s character. At first, Winston sees him as a nostalgic symbol of the past, but in the end he is revealed to be a member of the Thought Police, who represents the oncoming capture and torture of Winston and Julia. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;">There is also&nbsp;<strong>a third layer of symbolism</strong>&nbsp;connected to the rhyme, which is less obvious than the other two. If you take a look at the entire rhyme (see above), you will see that the very last line is &ldquo;Chip chop chip chop the last man is dead.&rdquo; This line never appears directly in&nbsp;<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, but the idea of being &lsquo;the last man&rsquo; is explored in one of the final scenes between Winston and O&rsquo;Brien:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are alone? You are outside history, you are non-existent.&rsquo; [...] &lsquo;You are rotting away,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn round and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity.&rsquo; (p. 285)</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;">A reader who is familiar with the nursery rhyme beforehand is therefore able to see an extra layer of symbolism. &lsquo;The last man is dead&rsquo; could be connected to the fact that Winston, as a representative of humanity and human emotions or ideals, will be dead before the story is over. Even though we do not literally see him being killed, he has been destroyed psychologically at the end, because all of his human emotions have been suppressed or replaced by the torture and brainwashing. In the last paragraphs, he also wishes for death: &ldquo;The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain&rdquo; (p. 311).</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;">Since Winston was &lsquo;the last man&rsquo;, this makes the book&rsquo;s conclusion even darker than it first appears. Not only is there no more hope for Winston and Julia, but there is no more hope for humanity as a whole. The Party - and its counterparts in the two other superstates - may have created such a perfect system that they are able to stay in control forever, leaving the earth as a permanent dystopia. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-guid="7175475a-e8cd-4254-a6c7-ddd39551742e" id="heading-wsqur">The coral paperweight</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The paperweight that Winston buys at Mr. Charrington&rsquo;s shop is described as follows:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rain-water, in both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone. (pp. 98-99)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston buys it because he is fascinated with its beauty and its connection to the time before the Party. In addition, it is by its very nature contrary to the Party&rsquo;s ideals, because it is a&nbsp;<strong>beautiful</strong>&nbsp;and mostly&nbsp;<strong>useless</strong>&nbsp;thing.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">To Winston, it eventually becomes&nbsp;<strong>a symbol of the happy - but impossible - future that he wants for himself and Julia</strong>. It represents his longing for a true escape from the Party&rsquo;s control. This is made especially clear when he daydreams about the two of them living inside of the glass, free from the party&rsquo;s reality (p. 154). A short time afterwards, he also compares the paperweight to the room above the junk shop, both seemingly representing worlds outside the Party&rsquo;s control:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">So long as they were actually in this room [...] no harm could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. (p. 158)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The link between the secret room and the paperweight is also seen at the end of Part II. As the room is breached by the police, the paperweight is also shattered. Both events are clear signs that Winston and Julia&rsquo;s dream is completely over - and that it was doomed to failure from the start. Winston&rsquo;s final observations about the coral inside reflect the fragile nature of his and Julia&rsquo;s dream, and their chances of getting away with it: &ldquo;How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!&rdquo; (p. 232).</span></p><h2 data-guid="e98b945a-41a7-4d27-ae60-c4b1bb5d0f59" id="heading-zkaph">2+2=5</h2><p><span style="color:black;">This twist on a basic mathematical problem is a symbol of the Party&rsquo;s ability to manipulate the truth. Since the Party controls all records and has influence on all human minds, their logic is that they have full control of what the basic facts of life are - even mathematical truths may be altered if the Party wishes.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston, on the other hand, clings to the idea that there are actual truths about the world independent from the Party, and that to be free means to have the ability to realise and express that. This is directly stated in a phrase he writes in his diary while considering the issue: &ldquo;<i>Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>(p. 84).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Goldstein&rsquo;s book also makes reference to this issue when describing the failures of governments in the past, and their reliance on science and mechanics in everyday life. By banishing these aspects to a strange form of constant warfare on the fringes of the state, the Party has managed to succeeding in changing reality: &ldquo;Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four&rdquo; (p. 206).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Later on, O&rsquo;Brien makes a reference to Winston&rsquo;s diary entry when he is trying to teach Winston to think like a true Party member. Through an extensive torture session, he attempts to make Winston realise that four can be equal to five when the Party wishes it to be so:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">O&rsquo;Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Four.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;And if the Party says that it is not four but five - then how many?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Four.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The word ended in a gasp of pain.&rsquo; (pp. 261-262)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston endures the torture for a while, but eventually the systematic brainwashing lets him start to think like a Party member:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">O&rsquo;Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers and there was no deformity. (p. 270)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">After more torture and brainwashing, he starts to agree that two plus two can sometimes make five (p. 290), showing that O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s treatment of him is finally effective.</span></p><h2 data-guid="cae6be20-65f3-4ab1-8f24-551302c83859" id="heading-rn84j">Light and darkness</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Traditionally, light is used to symbolise something that is good and positive, while darkness is used to symbolise something evil and negative.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, Orwell sometimes&nbsp;<strong>reverses this symbolism</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, playing with the reader&rsquo;s expectations and reinforcing the ironic tone of the novel.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We see an example of&nbsp;<strong>darkness</strong>&nbsp;<strong>representing something positive</strong>&nbsp;early on, when it is clarified that only darkness prevents the telescreen from observing people:&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&ldquo;You had to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised&rdquo; (p. 5).&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;">In the context of government surveillance,&nbsp;<strong>darkness</strong>&nbsp;therefore represents relative<strong>&nbsp;safety</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;"><strong>Light</strong>, on the other hand, is often used to&nbsp;<strong>represent something negative</strong>. The clearest example of this comes from Winston&rsquo;s dream about a person (possibly O&rsquo;Brien) who tells him &ldquo;We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness&rdquo; (p. 27).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At first, Winston mistakenly interprets this as a positive message (just as the reader might have done), but later he realises that the statement fits the everlasting light and bright white walls in the terrible Ministry of Love, which is designed around torture and fear (p. 241).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">On a symbolic level, the Ministry of Love is also &lsquo;a place where there is no darkness&rsquo; in the sense that it is&nbsp;<strong>impossible to hide</strong>&nbsp;there. Even your most secret emotions, thoughts and fears are always brought to light by the gruesome methods used by the Ministry employees.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">There are other examples of light being associated with negative things. We see this in the basic fact that&nbsp;<strong>bright colours like</strong>&nbsp;<strong>white and blue are associated with the Party</strong>, which is later tied into the symbolism of a chess board in the final chapter of the book:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always&nbsp;mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolise the eternal, unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates. (p. 302)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The white pieces on the chessboard symbolise the Party and Big Brother - and Winston reflects that there is no way they will be defeated, just as the white pieces always win in the solutions to chess problems.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="themes.html" title="Themes 1984" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Themes</span></a><a href="message.html" title="Message of the novel 1984" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Message</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

In the minds of the citizens, he is often associated with positive qualities. He appears as protector, always appearing as a reassuring figure at the end of Hate videos or news about war, promising safety from the states\u0026rsquo; enemies. We see a clear example of this in the beginning of the book, when the employees at the Ministry of Truth react to his appearance on-screen:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026hellip;drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio\u0026rsquo;d, full of power and mysterious calm [\u0026hellip;] Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement [\u0026hellip;] restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. (p. 18)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eAs Goldstein book points out, Big Brother\u0026rsquo;s name is no coincidence. By using a term that normally describes a close family member, his name is designed to inspire love and dedication. On a darker level, it also implies that this love is meant to replace the personal love that people might have felt for their own family members: \u0026ldquo;[The Party] systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty\u0026rdquo; (p. 225).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eBig Brother also serves as a symbol of the state\u0026rsquo;s constant surveillance of its people. This is shown in the design of the ever-present posters of him: \u0026ldquo;It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran\u0022\u0026nbsp;(p. 3). The posters are meant to remind the citizens of the fact that they are being watched, to keep them in line at all times. Big Brother\u0026rsquo;s frequent appearance on the telescreens probably has a similar effect, as citizens are well-aware that the screens are being used to spy on everybody. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00228de4e0e1-c87f-4a96-ba7d-e40093dd7b84\u0022 id=\u0022heading-mnk0i\u0022\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oranges and Lemons\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe old British nursery rhyme \u0026ldquo;Oranges and Lemons\u0026rdquo; plays a significant role in the story, as Winston gradually tracks down its lines.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#0075e3;\u0022\u003eYou can read the full text of the rhyme here\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003eThe symbolism of this rhyme has several different layers. For most of the book, Winston\u0026rsquo;s efforts to track down the entire poem represents his fascination with the past before the Party, and the image of a London free from their control. The rhyme therefore seems to symbolise something\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ebeautiful and nostalgic\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;in the early sections of the story:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eIt was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. (p. 103)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003eHowever, the final section of the rhyme takes a much\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003edarker turn\u003c/strong\u003e, with its direct references to death and execution. When Winston first hears these lines from Mr. Charrington, he does not pay special attention to them, but they serve as\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eforeshadowing\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;of Charrington\u0026rsquo;s later betrayal. This is made completely clear when Charrington repeats the lines in the scene when Winston and Julia are finally caught (p. 231). This points to how the Party has taken something innocent like a children\u0026rsquo;s rhyme and turned it into a form of psychological manipulation and entrapment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003eIn some ways, the symbolism of the rhyme reflects Mr. Charrington\u0026rsquo;s character. At first, Winston sees him as a nostalgic symbol of the past, but in the end he is revealed to be a member of the Thought Police, who represents the oncoming capture and torture of Winston and Julia. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003eThere is also\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ea third layer of symbolism\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;connected to the rhyme, which is less obvious than the other two. If you take a look at the entire rhyme (see above), you will see that the very last line is \u0026ldquo;Chip chop chip chop the last man is dead.\u0026rdquo; This line never appears directly in\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eNineteen Eighty-Four\u003c/i\u003e, but the idea of being \u0026lsquo;the last man\u0026rsquo; is explored in one of the final scenes between Winston and O\u0026rsquo;Brien:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are alone? You are outside history, you are non-existent.\u0026rsquo; [...] \u0026lsquo;You are rotting away,\u0026rsquo; he said; \u0026lsquo;you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn round and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity.\u0026rsquo; (p. 285)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003eA reader who is familiar with the nursery rhyme beforehand is therefore able to see an extra layer of symbolism. \u0026lsquo;The last man is dead\u0026rsquo; could be connected to the fact that Winston, as a representative of humanity and human emotions or ideals, will be dead before the story is over. Even though we do not literally see him being killed, he has been destroyed psychologically at the end, because all of his human emotions have been suppressed or replaced by the torture and brainwashing. In the last paragraphs, he also wishes for death: \u0026ldquo;The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain\u0026rdquo; (p. 311).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003eSince Winston was \u0026lsquo;the last man\u0026rsquo;, this makes the book\u0026rsquo;s conclusion even darker than it first appears. Not only is there no more hope for Winston and Julia, but there is no more hope for humanity as a whole. The Party - and its counterparts in the two other superstates - may have created such a perfect system that they are able to stay in control forever, leaving the earth as a permanent dystopia. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00227175475a-e8cd-4254-a6c7-ddd39551742e\u0022 id=\u0022heading-wsqur\u0022\u003eThe coral paperweight\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe paperweight that Winston buys at Mr. Charrington\u0026rsquo;s shop is described as follows:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eIt was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rain-water, in both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone. (pp. 98-99)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinston buys it because he is fascinated with its beauty and its connection to the time before the Party. In addition, it is by its very nature contrary to the Party\u0026rsquo;s ideals, because it is a\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ebeautiful\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;and mostly\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003euseless\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;thing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTo Winston, it eventually becomes\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ea symbol of the happy - but impossible - future that he wants for himself and Julia\u003c/strong\u003e. It represents his longing for a true escape from the Party\u0026rsquo;s control. This is made especially clear when he daydreams about the two of them living inside of the glass, free from the party\u0026rsquo;s reality (p. 154). A short time afterwards, he also compares the paperweight to the room above the junk shop, both seemingly representing worlds outside the Party\u0026rsquo;s control:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eSo long as they were actually in this room [...] no harm could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. (p. 158)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe link between the secret room and the paperweight is also seen at the end of Part II. As the room is breached by the police, the paperweight is also shattered. Both events are clear signs that Winston and Julia\u0026rsquo;s dream is completely over - and that it was doomed to failure from the start. Winston\u0026rsquo;s final observations about the coral inside reflect the fragile nature of his and Julia\u0026rsquo;s dream, and their chances of getting away with it: \u0026ldquo;How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!\u0026rdquo; (p. 232).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022e98b945a-41a7-4d27-ae60-c4b1bb5d0f59\u0022 id=\u0022heading-zkaph\u0022\u003e2+2=5\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThis twist on a basic mathematical problem is a symbol of the Party\u0026rsquo;s ability to manipulate the truth. Since the Party controls all records and has influence on all human minds, their logic is that they have full control of what the basic facts of life are - even mathematical truths may be altered if the Party wishes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinston, on the other hand, clings to the idea that there are actual truths about the world independent from the Party, and that to be free means to have the ability to realise and express that. This is directly stated in a phrase he writes in his diary while considering the issue: \u0026ldquo;\u003ci\u003eFreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e(p. 84).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eGoldstein\u0026rsquo;s book also makes reference to this issue when describing the failures of governments in the past, and their reliance on science and mechanics in everyday life. By banishing these aspects to a strange form of constant warfare on the fringes of the state, the Party has managed to succeeding in changing reality: \u0026ldquo;Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four\u0026rdquo; (p. 206).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eLater on, O\u0026rsquo;Brien makes a reference to Winston\u0026rsquo;s diary entry when he is trying to teach Winston to think like a true Party member. Through an extensive torture session, he attempts to make Winston realise that four can be equal to five when the Party wishes it to be so:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eO\u0026rsquo;Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?\u0026rsquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;Four.\u0026rsquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;And if the Party says that it is not four but five - then how many?\u0026rsquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;Four.\u0026rsquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eThe word ended in a gasp of pain.\u0026rsquo; (pp. 261-262)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinston endures the torture for a while, but eventually the systematic brainwashing lets him start to think like a Party member:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eO\u0026rsquo;Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;There are five fingers there.

The clearest example of this comes from Winston\u0026rsquo;s dream about a person (possibly O\u0026rsquo;Brien) who tells him \u0026ldquo;We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness\u0026rdquo; (p. 27).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt first, Winston mistakenly interprets this as a positive message (just as the reader might have done), but later he realises that the statement fits the everlasting light and bright white walls in the terrible Ministry of Love, which is designed around torture and fear (p. 241).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eOn a symbolic level, the Ministry of Love is also \u0026lsquo;a place where there is no darkness\u0026rsquo; in the sense that it is\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eimpossible to hide\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;there.
