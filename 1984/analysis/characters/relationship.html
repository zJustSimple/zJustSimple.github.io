His hatred is so strong that he even daydreams about raping her and murdering her (p. 17).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, in the middle section of the book it is revealed that she is merely keeping a close eye on Winston because she is romantically attracted to him (p. 111). This leads to a romantic and sexual relationship between them, even though they have to meet in secret because relationships between non-married Party members are not permitted in Oceanian society.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Though their relationship is mainly sexual at first, they also seem to develop genuine romantic affection for each other (p. 146), and they quickly become very close and share even their most secret thoughts and emotions.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">An example of their dedication can also be seen when they join the Brotherhood, since they declare themselves willing to perform all kinds of horrible acts in the service of the rebellion, with the one exception of leaving each other (p. 180). However, it is interesting to note that while Julia immediately says that she would be unwilling to leave Winston, Winston is more hesitant to declare that he would never leave Julia (though he eventually does so). This may of course reflect that Winston believes more in the cause of the rebellion than Julia (also indicated elsewhere), but may also reveal that her love is stronger than his (or a combination of the two). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Despite Julia and Winston&rsquo;s dedication to each other, their love proves unable to survive the horrible tortures they each face in the dreaded Room 101. When they meet again at the end of the story, their brief conversation reveals that they both realise this (pp. 304-305).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">An interesting final detail is the fact that Julia&rsquo;s tortures (the details of which are not revealed) seemingly left her with a physical scar (p. 304), whereas Winston put a stop to the torture before the rats actually did any physical damage to him (pp. 299-300) - once again, this might be an indirect way to show that Julia&rsquo;s love may have been stronger than Winston&rsquo;s, even though it was eventually destroyed as well.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="377ed7e2-5476-4d6d-b96a-ac8473e3004e">Winston and O&rsquo;Brien</h2><p><span style="color:black;">At the beginning of the story, we are told that Winston feels some kind of connection to O&rsquo;Brien and longs to confide in him: &ldquo;[...] he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to, if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone&rdquo; (p. 13).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston further suspects that O&rsquo;Brien might be like him - a person who does not fully believe in the Party&rsquo;s propaganda, despite him being a respected member of the Inner Party on the surface. This feeling is strengthened when Winston shares a brief, knowing look with him during one of the Party&rsquo;s regular propaganda events early in the story:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. &lsquo;I am with you,&rsquo; O&rsquo;Brien seemed to be saying to him. &lsquo;I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don&rsquo;t worry, I am on your side!&rsquo; (p.19)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">O&rsquo;Brien also features in a strange dream Winston had years before the plot begins, where he gave him a&nbsp;<em>seemingly</em>&nbsp;reassuring and hopeful message: &ldquo;We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness&rdquo; (p. 27). When he confronts the real-life O&rsquo;Brien with this statement later on, he strangely seems to recognise it (p. 185).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">When O&rsquo;Brien arranges for Winston to learn his address, Winston becomes even more convinced that he must belong to the Brotherhood, the secret resistance movement against the Party and Big Brother (pp. 164-167). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Soon afterwards, Winston and Julia visit O&rsquo;Brien in his home, directly asking him if they can join the Brotherhood (p. 177). O&rsquo;Brien agrees to this request, and offer them instructions about their future duties and responsibilities (pp. 179-186).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">When it is finally revealed that O&rsquo;Brien is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a member of the Brotherhood, but actually a loyal member of the Inner Party connected to the Ministry of Love, the exchange between him and Winston is particularly interesting to consider, as it recalls the fact that Winston was never entirely sure whether O&rsquo;Brien was friend or enemy:&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&ldquo; &lsquo;You knew this, Winston,&rsquo; said O&rsquo;Brien. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t deceive yourself. You did know it - you have always known it.&rsquo; Yes, he saw now, he had always known it&rdquo; (p. 251).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Curiously, despite O&rsquo;Brien proceeding to torture Winston in various cruel ways, the relationship between them is sometimes shown to be almost friendly.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">O&rsquo;Brien, in his twisted way, seems genuinely interested in &lsquo;curing&rsquo; Winston, converting him to a true Party member. Often he speaks kindly to him, or seems concerned about his well-being. Of course, it is likely that these positive words and acts are all part of his manipulation, but at one point he does seem to express his genuine positive feelings, and at the same time remarks on the similarity between Winston and himself: &ldquo;I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane&rdquo; (p. 271).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston, for his part, occasionally shows signs of&nbsp;Stockholm Syndrome, as he grows emotionally close to the man who imprisoned him and is now torturing him. Particularly in scenes when he is almost completely broken down by the torture, O&rsquo;Brien almost seems like a comforting figure and Winston continues to feel the strange emotional connection to him that was formed in the beginning of the story:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">O&rsquo;Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could meet and talk.&nbsp;(p. 264)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The contrasts that exist in Winston&rsquo;s relationship with O&rsquo;Brien are also summarised in a single sentence earlier on: &ldquo;He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend&rdquo; (p. 256).</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="other.html" title="Other characters 1984" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Other characters</span></a><a href="../setting.html" title="Setting in the novel 1984" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Setting</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

His hatred is so strong that he even daydreams about raping her and murdering her (p. 17).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eHowever, in the middle section of the book it is revealed that she is merely keeping a close eye on Winston because she is romantically attracted to him (p. 111). This leads to a romantic and sexual relationship between them, even though they have to meet in secret because relationships between non-married Party members are not permitted in Oceanian society.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThough their relationship is mainly sexual at first, they also seem to develop genuine romantic affection for each other (p. 146), and they quickly become very close and share even their most secret thoughts and emotions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAn example of their dedication can also be seen when they join the Brotherhood, since they declare themselves willing to perform all kinds of horrible acts in the service of the rebellion, with the one exception of leaving each other (p. 180). However, it is interesting to note that while Julia immediately says that she would be unwilling to leave Winston, Winston is more hesitant to declare that he would never leave Julia (though he eventually does so). This may of course reflect that Winston believes more in the cause of the rebellion than Julia (also indicated elsewhere), but may also reveal that her love is stronger than his (or a combination of the two). \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eDespite Julia and Winston\u0026rsquo;s dedication to each other, their love proves unable to survive the horrible tortures they each face in the dreaded Room 101. When they meet again at the end of the story, their brief conversation reveals that they both realise this (pp. 304-305).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAn interesting final detail is the fact that Julia\u0026rsquo;s tortures (the details of which are not revealed) seemingly left her with a physical scar (p. 304), whereas Winston put a stop to the torture before the rats actually did any physical damage to him (pp. 299-300) - once again, this might be an indirect way to show that Julia\u0026rsquo;s love may have been stronger than Winston\u0026rsquo;s, even though it was eventually destroyed as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022377ed7e2-5476-4d6d-b96a-ac8473e3004e\u0022\u003eWinston and O\u0026rsquo;Brien\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt the beginning of the story, we are told that Winston feels some kind of connection to O\u0026rsquo;Brien and longs to confide in him: \u0026ldquo;[...] he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to, if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone\u0026rdquo; (p. 13).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinston further suspects that O\u0026rsquo;Brien might be like him - a person who does not fully believe in the Party\u0026rsquo;s propaganda, despite him being a respected member of the Inner Party on the surface. This feeling is strengthened when Winston shares a brief, knowing look with him during one of the Party\u0026rsquo;s regular propaganda events early in the story:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eAn unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. \u0026lsquo;I am with you,\u0026rsquo; O\u0026rsquo;Brien seemed to be saying to him. \u0026lsquo;I know precisely what you are feeling.

When he confronts the real-life O\u0026rsquo;Brien with this statement later on, he strangely seems to recognise it (p. 185).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWhen O\u0026rsquo;Brien arranges for Winston to learn his address, Winston becomes even more convinced that he must belong to the Brotherhood, the secret resistance movement against the Party and Big Brother (pp. 164-167). \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSoon afterwards, Winston and Julia visit O\u0026rsquo;Brien in his home, directly asking him if they can join the Brotherhood (p. 177). O\u0026rsquo;Brien agrees to this request, and offer them instructions about their future duties and responsibilities (pp. 179-186).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWhen it is finally revealed that O\u0026rsquo;Brien is\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;a member of the Brotherhood, but actually a loyal member of the Inner Party connected to the Ministry of Love, the exchange between him and Winston is particularly interesting to consider, as it recalls the fact that Winston was never entirely sure whether O\u0026rsquo;Brien was friend or enemy:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;You knew this, Winston,\u0026rsquo; said O\u0026rsquo;Brien. \u0026lsquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t deceive yourself.

Often he speaks kindly to him, or seems concerned about his well-being. Of course, it is likely that these positive words and acts are all part of his manipulation, but at one point he does seem to express his genuine positive feelings, and at the same time remarks on the similarity between Winston and himself: \u0026ldquo;I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane\u0026rdquo; (p. 271).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinston, for his part, occasionally shows signs of\u0026nbsp;Stockholm Syndrome, as he grows emotionally close to the man who imprisoned him and is now torturing him. Particularly in scenes when he is almost completely broken down by the torture, O\u0026rsquo;Brien almost seems like a comforting figure and Winston continues to feel the strange emotional connection to him that was formed in the beginning of the story:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eO\u0026rsquo;Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference.
