Some of these are described more or less directly throughout the narrative itself, but you can also find a more systematic description in the sections of Goldstein&rsquo;s</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;book that Winston reads towards the end of Part II. If you want to brush up on the social setting, pages&nbsp;<strong>192-226</strong>&nbsp;might therefore be particularly useful to re-read.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Of course, since it is revealed that Goldstein&rsquo;s book was in fact written by Party members, you should always keep in mind that some of its information could be untrustworthy, as the book&rsquo;s narrator is&nbsp;<strong>unreliable&nbsp;</strong>(p. 274). However, the fact that Winston feels that the book does not tell him anything he does not already know (p. 208) indicates that the social structures it describes match those that Winston observes in his everyday life.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="6edb36e8-c5aa-49b7-97b4-d74f83ab9208"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Social classes</span></h2><p><span style="color:black;">Oceanian society is divided into three social classes, centred around the political party INGSOC (short for &ldquo;English Socialism&rdquo;), which has complete control of society: Members of the Inner Party, members of the Outer Party, and &lsquo;proles&rsquo; (who do not directly belong to the Party but are still under its control). Above everything is the mysterious Big Brother, the leader of the Party and therefore of the state. Finally, we are told of a mysterious resistance group known as the Brotherhood (but it is unclear whether this really exists).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Goldstein&rsquo;s book reveals that this social structure is carefully designed to eliminate any possibility of rebellion. The proles are kept uneducated and therefore never realise that society might have a different structure, while Party members are systematically indoctrinated to wish to keep the Party in power - and also constantly watched to ensure that no one tries to do anything different. Those who attempt to rebel, or who are seen to hold views that are inimical to the Party are eliminated or &lsquo;vaporised&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">Big Brother</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">The leader of the Party is simply known as Big Brother, an imposing figure who is displayed on posters all around London, and who frequently appears at the end of propaganda videos: &ldquo;[The poster] depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features&rdquo; (p. 3).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">It is strongly implied that Big Brother is simply a useful symbol of leadership (pp. 216-217) and does not really exist, since he only ever appears on posters and telescreens. O&rsquo;Brien even freely admits that Big Brother will never die (p. 272), which is another argument that points to his non-existence. Instead, Oceania is ruled by a collective group of people who together make up the Inner Party.</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Inner Party</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">Members of the Inner Party form the upper class of society and in practice act as the rulers of the state, collectively. They clearly enjoy more luxuries than the other classes, as we learn that they live in better buildings, have more reliable access to electricity and get food and drink of much better quality. They also typically have a few personal servants to tend to their needs.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Since the economy of Oceania is collectivised, the Inner Party essentially owns everything and has full control of the economy. &nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;">However, it is also stated that they still do not enjoy the level of luxury that the upper classes might have had access to in a capitalistic society, because - as O&rsquo;Brien reveals - the real purpose of their control is not wealth, but simply the preservation of power (p. 275).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It is interesting to note that membership of the Inner Party is not racist in any way &ndash; in contrast to typical fascist states from the real world &ndash; as membership is based on selecting the people most suitable to keep the Party in eternal control of society, regardless of ethnicity&nbsp;(p. 217).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Goldstein&rsquo;s book notes that about 2% of the population belongs to the Inner Party (p. 217). &nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Outer Party</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">Members of the Outer Party form the middle class of society. Despite being middle class, it is clear that many Outer Party members, including Winston, still live in some level of poverty. This is clearly indicated early on in the description of the apartment complex that Winston and the Parsons family live in (pp. 3-7, 23-24), but also through the general difficulty of obtaining everyday items such as razor blades, or the strict rationing of luxury goods such as chocolate.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Members of the Outer Party typically work in one of the four Ministries (see below). It is implied that their workload is very heavy, and that they often receive extreme levels of overwork when a particular situation calls for it (p. 190). In addition to this, they are expected to spend much of their free time volunteering for various Party activities, as refusing to do so may create suspicion against them.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We also learn that members of the Outer Party are constantly watched for even the smallest indication that they might not be completely loyal. Anyone who seems critical of the system is taken by the police - and either &lsquo;removed&rsquo; or sent to a forced labour camp.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Because of all these issues, it is fairly clear that members of the Outer Party typically do not lead very happy lives, despite their position in the middle class.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Goldstein&rsquo;s book implies that about 13% of the population belong to the Outer Party (p. 217).</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The proles</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">The proles (short for &lsquo;proletariat&rsquo;) form the lower class of society and a clear majority of the population belongs to this class. They are the workers responsible for all the manual labour that keeps society running, such as production of food, tools and buildings.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The proles live in poverty and have a very low level of education. They are kept content through a steady stream of mindless entertainment produced by the Ministry of Truth, particularly its Fiction Department (where Julia works). Alcohol also seems to be part of the strategy to encourage their passivity, as there are numerous pubs in the prole districts.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, because the proles have so little power and influence, the Party largely considers their opinions unimportant and therefore they do not need to obey the same strict rules that Party members have to live by. They are also not kept under constant surveillance to the extent that Party members are (though we do learn that the Thought Police occasionally select potentially rebellious proles for elimination, p. 218).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In some ways, their lives seem to be happier than those of Outer Party members, because they escape the curse of constant surveillance and extremely strict rules. Furthermore, we learn that criminal proles are actually treated much better than political prisoners in Oceania, often rising to positions of power within the forced labour camps, which are mainly designed to punish Party members who lack loyalty (pp. 238-239).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston also regards their lives as more&nbsp;<em>pure</em>&nbsp;than the Party member&rsquo;s, as they still live in accordance with basic human emotions and ideals, despite the suffering and oppression they endure from the Party (pp. 228-229).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, the proles are the main victims of the on-going wars against the other superstates, as bombs are often dropped on their areas. This also means that their anger is easy for the Party to control and direct, when they need the proles to work extra hard to support the war efforts.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston believes that the proles represent the hope of rebellion against the Party&rsquo;s rule (pp. 229-230), though O&rsquo;Brien disagrees and argues that they are simply too ignorant and weak to even consider rebellion (p. 274).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Goldstein&rsquo;s book notes that about 85% of the population are proles (p. 217).</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Brotherhood</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">The Brotherhood is the possibly-fictional resistance movement against the Party&rsquo;s rule, led by Emmanuel Goldstein. According to the official story, Goldstein was originally one of the founding members of the Party alongside Big Brother, but he betrayed their principles and fled into exile (pp. 13-14). The philosophy of the Brotherhood is described in a famous, forbidden book written by Goldstein, called &ldquo;The Theory and Practice of&nbsp;Oligarchical Collectivism</span>&rdquo; (or simply &ldquo;<em>the book</em>&rdquo;).</p><p><span style="color:black;">We seemingly learn more details about the way the Brotherhood operates during Winston and Julia&rsquo;s meeting with O&rsquo;Brien (pp. 178-186), and we seemingly learn more details about their philosophy as Winston reads Goldstein&rsquo;s book (pp. 192-226).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, it is later revealed that O&rsquo;Brien was merely&nbsp;<em>pretending</em>&nbsp;to belong to the Brotherhood, and that the version of Goldstein&rsquo;s book Winston read had in fact been written by Party members (p. 271), probably to mislead and capture potential rebels. Ultimately, it remains unclear whether Goldstein and the Brotherhood even exist, as O&rsquo;Brien refuses to tell Winston the full truth:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Does the Brotherhood exist?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.&rsquo; (p. 272)</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="d1bf55b8-6173-407d-93fe-2e93383982c3"><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Four Ministries</span></h2><p><span style="color:black;">Oceanian society is controlled by the four government ministries, which are each concerned with a particular area of society.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">It is important to note that all of the ministries have&nbsp;<strong>ironic names</strong>, which both reflects the contradictory political philosophy of INGSOC and Orwell&rsquo;s satirical style. The irony is directly revealed in Goldstein&rsquo;s book: &ldquo;The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.&rdquo; (p. 225).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The book provides the most detailed information about the Ministry of Truth (where Winston and Julia work) and the Ministry of Love (where Part III of the novel is mostly set), but we also get some information about the other two.</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Ministry of Peace</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">This Ministry is concerned with waging war against the other nations. It is implied that their work is mostly&nbsp;<strong>symbolical</strong>, as Goldstein&rsquo;s book reveals that the three states really maintain their constant wars to keep their own populations under strict control and avoid creating too many resources that would raise their standard of living.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Therefore, none of the three superpowers actually need to achieve victory, they simply need to keep the war going so they can use the idea of the war to motivate people and create useful feelings of national pride and military fanaticism. This idea is summarised in Goldstein&rsquo;s book:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In our own day they are not fighting against each other at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. (p. 207)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We further learn that the Ministry of Peace have research labs across the world where they try to invent new methods of waging war (p. 201-204) - but it is also revealed that their efforts are largely unimportant, because they are unlikely to be realised.</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Ministry of Truth</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">This Ministry plays a central role in Oceanian society, as it is responsible for producing both news stories and entertainment.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In practice its work is concerned with creating state propaganda, which presents the version of reality that the Party wants the people to believe. A significant part of this work is focused on altering historical records whenever it becomes necessary, modifying past events to match new events and stories.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We see a clear example of this process when the war situation suddenly changes, so Oceania is at war with Eastasia instead of Eurasia. Suddenly, employees of the Ministry of Truth are called in for an intense period of overwork, changing all historical records to reflect that Oceania has&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;been at war with Eastasia - which means modifications of all speeches, newspaper articles or similar that have ever referred to the ongoing war (pp. 189-191).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Employees of this Ministry are systematically trained to make use of the&nbsp;<em>doublethink</em>&nbsp;technique - which means that the ideal employee starts to&nbsp;<em>believe</em>&nbsp;in the new version of the facts, even after having been personally involved in altering them.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Part of the Ministry&rsquo;s approach is to avoid admitting &ndash; or allowing its employees to admit &ndash; that anything contradictory is happening. Winston notes that:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Even the written instructions [&hellip;] never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy. (p. 43)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Furthermore, Winston is aware that the new information probably has no more &lsquo;truth&rsquo; in it than the old information. The Ministry of Truth is solely concerned with manipulating the minds of its subjects:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. (p. 43)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It is also interesting to note that the Fiction department of the Ministry have turned creative writing into a mechanical process, even using &lsquo;novel-writing machines&rsquo; (p. 11) to generate mindless entertainment with repetitive plotlines &ndash; always fitting the Party&rsquo;s propaganda messages.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">A subsection of the Ministry of Truth is concerned with the development of&nbsp;<strong>Newspeak</strong>&nbsp;- a modified, simplistic version of English which is designed to both drastically reduce the number of words and drastically reduce the number of possible meanings that each word might have. The end goal of Newspeak is to make it impossible to even think rebellious thoughts, because even the&nbsp;<em>concept of rebellion</em>&nbsp;would be impossible to express in language (and therefore, it is argued, impossible to think about) (pp.55-56).</span>​​​​​​​</p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Ministry of Love</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">This Ministry deals with the law enforcement of Oceania. They are particularly concerned with&nbsp;<em>thoughtcrimes</em>&nbsp;- which means any hint of disloyalty to the Party&rsquo;s mission. The people they mostly target are therefore not criminals in our sense, but may simply be people who are likely to have&nbsp;<em>thoughts</em>&nbsp;about resistance or which are critical towards the Party.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even the smallest details might cause someone to become the target of the Thought Police - for example, someone might display the wrong facial expression when viewing a propaganda message (<em>facecrime</em>, p. 65), or might even be talking in his or her sleep (the otherwise loyal Mr. Parsons is arrested for this reason, p. 245). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">When a person is brought into the Ministry, they are subjected to all kinds of physical and psychological torture to break down any kind of resistance they might have. This is done even if they are meant to be executed afterwards, as the Party does not even wish to let a person die</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;as a rebel. Therefore, all &lsquo;traitors&rsquo; are converted before they die, so there is no risk of anyone becoming a martyr:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. [&hellip;] It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation.&rsquo; (p. 267)</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Ministry of Plenty</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">We do not get a lot of direct information about this Ministry, though we know that its focus is on the economy and the various goods produced for society. Despite its name, its main purpose seems to be strict control of key resources, to ensure that the population&rsquo;s standard of living does not become too high. Its existence also reveals that Oceania has a&nbsp;planned economy</span>&nbsp;as opposed to a free market economy.</p><p><span style="color:black;">The Ministry of Plenty is often featured in propaganda messages (e.g. p. 61), which often state that production of a particular item is at an all-time high, even though there may be drastic shortages of it in the lives of the citizens.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="264041fe-78e7-47df-a0f9-9d593c39857f"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Family life</span></h2><p><span style="color:black;">A significant element in the Party&rsquo;s total control of society is the strategies they use to corrupt some of the patterns that exist in traditional family structures.</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">Men and women</span></h3><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Though not stated directly, the novel gives the impression that the world of Oceania is plagued with&nbsp;misogyny</span>&nbsp;and gender inequality. We rarely hear about female members of the Inner Party, and women do not seem to occupy many leading positions in general. For example, despite women being thought best suited to work with the production of pornography, it is noted that the head of the&nbsp;<em>Pornosec</em>&nbsp;department is a man (p. 137).</p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Women are also subjected to more strict indoctrination than men when it comes to sex and are held to higher moral standards in that area (p. 139),&nbsp;which is another classic sign of misogyny.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Even Winston, the main character of the story, often displays misogyny in both his thoughts and his behaviour. By his own account he detests women (p. 12), and he even has fantasies of rape at the beginning of the story (p. 17). Even when he starts to question himself more towards the middle of the story, he still sometimes acts entitled in his relationship to Julia: "She had become a physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him&rdquo; (p. 146).</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">Love and sexuality</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">The sex lives of Party members are very strictly controlled. Sex is only permitted between married partners, and only for the specific purpose of having children. Any other kind of sex (homosexual sex, sex between non-married partners or even sex between married partners for the sake of enjoyment) is strictly forbidden. Furthermore, there are even youth organisations such as the Junior Anti-Sex League which favour total sexual abstinence, arguing that it would be preferable if people only had children through artificial insemination.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Julia speculates about the reasons why the Party would wish to restrict sex and turn it into something shameful:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;When you make love you&rsquo;re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don&rsquo;t give a damn for anything. They can&rsquo;t bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. [...] If you&rsquo;re happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot? (p. 139)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In a way, the Party&rsquo;s total control relies on the population feeling constant sexual frustration, which is then turned into military rage and devotion to the Party.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even romantic love between partners is difficult to achieve in Oceania, because no one is ever able to fully trust each other, as everybody is a potential spy. Winston notes that his wife, Katharine, would certainly have turned him in if she had realised he was a thought criminal (p. 140). We also learn that the Party actively tries to restrict marriages between people who seem to be attracted to each other.</span></p><h3><span style="color:#1a242e;">Parents and children</span></h3><p><span style="color:black;">It is noted that children of Party members are exposed to extreme levels of indoctrination, for example through membership of the Junior Spies (a sort of twisted version of the Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts). Though the story only features a few children directly, the ones we do see are depicted as fanatically loyal to the Party and to Big Brother, while also being deeply fascinated with warfare and violence.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The Parsons children are clear examples of this:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Suddenly they were both leaping around him [...] It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy&rsquo;s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. (p. 25)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston further remarks that,</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organisations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatsoever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. (p. 26)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Because children tend to be violently devoted to the Party, their own parents are often afraid of them. We see a clear example of this in the description of Mrs. Parsons, who clearly has very little control of her children: &ldquo;[...] what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman&rsquo;s greyish face&rdquo; (p. 26).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Towards the end of the book, we learn that this kind of fear is well-founded, as Mr. Parsons&rsquo; seven-year-old daughter turns him in to the authorities without hesitation after hearing him saying rebellious things in his sleep (p. 245).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">By turning children against their parents in this way, the Party ends up with an enormous group of devoted spies, ready to turn in their own parents at the slightest opportunity. However, the Party still encourages parents to love their children, heightening the feelings of fear:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. (p. 140)</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="physical-setting.html" title="Physical setting in the novel 1984" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Physical setting</span></a><a href="../../interpretation.html" title="Interpretation of the novel 1984" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Interpretation</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Above everything is the mysterious Big Brother, the leader of the Party and therefore of the state. Finally, we are told of a mysterious resistance group known as the Brotherhood (but it is unclear whether this really exists).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eGoldstein\u0026rsquo;s book reveals that this social structure is carefully designed to eliminate any possibility of rebellion. The proles are kept uneducated and therefore never realise that society might have a different structure, while Party members are systematically indoctrinated to wish to keep the Party in power - and also constantly watched to ensure that no one tries to do anything different. Those who attempt to rebel, or who are seen to hold views that are inimical to the Party are eliminated or \u0026lsquo;vaporised\u0026rsquo;.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eBig Brother\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe leader of the Party is simply known as Big Brother, an imposing figure who is displayed on posters all around London, and who frequently appears at the end of propaganda videos: \u0026ldquo;[The poster] depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features\u0026rdquo; (p. 3).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIt is strongly implied that Big Brother is simply a useful symbol of leadership (pp. 216-217) and does not really exist, since he only ever appears on posters and telescreens. O\u0026rsquo;Brien even freely admits that Big Brother will never die (p. 272), which is another argument that points to his non-existence. Instead, Oceania is ruled by a collective group of people who together make up the Inner Party.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eThe Inner Party\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMembers of the Inner Party form the upper class of society and in practice act as the rulers of the state, collectively.

Despite being middle class, it is clear that many Outer Party members, including Winston, still live in some level of poverty. This is clearly indicated early on in the description of the apartment complex that Winston and the Parsons family live in (pp. 3-7, 23-24), but also through the general difficulty of obtaining everyday items such as razor blades, or the strict rationing of luxury goods such as chocolate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMembers of the Outer Party typically work in one of the four Ministries (see below). It is implied that their workload is very heavy, and that they often receive extreme levels of overwork when a particular situation calls for it (p. 190). In addition to this, they are expected to spend much of their free time volunteering for various Party activities, as refusing to do so may create suspicion against them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWe also learn that members of the Outer Party are constantly watched for even the smallest indication that they might not be completely loyal.

We see a clear example of this in the description of Mrs. Parsons, who clearly has very little control of her children: \u0026ldquo;[...] what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman\u0026rsquo;s greyish face\u0026rdquo; (p. 26).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTowards the end of the book, we learn that this kind of fear is well-founded, as Mr. Parsons\u0026rsquo; seven-year-old daughter turns him in to the authorities without hesitation after hearing him saying rebellious things in his sleep (p. 245).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eBy turning children against their parents in this way, the Party ends up with an enormous group of devoted spies, ready to turn in their own parents at the slightest opportunity. However, the Party still encourages parents to love their children, heightening the feelings of fear:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eThe family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police.
