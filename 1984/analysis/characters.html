Therefore, the way a character is first presented may not reflect their true identity. For example, Winston is mistaken about Julia in Part I, and mistaken about Mr. Charrington and O&rsquo;Brien in Part II.</span></p><div  class="onpagetoc" data-h3included="true"><span class="onpagetoc-header" >Cuprins</span><ul><li><a title="Winston" href="#heading-1">Winston</a><ul><li><a title="Introduction" href="#heading-2">Introduction</a></li><li><a title="Part I" href="#heading-3">Part I</a></li><li><a title="Part II" href="#heading-4">Part II</a></li><li><a title="Part III" href="#heading-5">Part III</a></li></ul></li><li><a title="Julia" href="#heading-6">Julia</a></li><li><a title="O'Brien" href="#heading-7">O'Brien</a></li></ul></div><p> </p><h2 id="heading-1" data-guid="670f9288-8a57-4412-bf9d-1ee09f809256">Winston</h2><h3 id="heading-2">Introduction</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Winston Smith is the main character of&nbsp;<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>. Although the story is told by a third-person narrator, the point of view is limited to Winston and we get full access to his particular point of view.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Both his first and last names contain symbolic elements.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The last name Smith</span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;is one of the most common names in the English-speaking world, which shows that he is meant to represent an&nbsp;<strong>everyman</strong>, a representative of the average human being &ndash; and how such a person might react within a dystopian reality.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The first name Winston</span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;may be inspired by Winston Churchill, who was Prime Minister of Great Britain during the Second World War and a key figure in the Allies&rsquo; struggle against Nazi Germany and the other Axis powers (which happened just a few years before Orwell wrote the book). This is meant to highlight the fact that Winston is a rebel who fights against an oppressive regime (which is in many ways comparable to Nazi Germany), even though his story ends in defeat rather than victory.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston is a&nbsp;<strong>developing character</strong>, as both his outer and inner characterisation change dramatically as the story progresses through its three parts. We have therefore split our characterisation of Winston into several different parts as well.</span></p><h3 id="heading-3">Part I</h3><p ><strong>Outer characterisation</strong></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston&rsquo;s outer characterisation reveals that he is a 39-year-old man at the beginning of the story. He is described as having a &ldquo;smallish, frail figure&rdquo;, and the description continue: &ldquo;His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended&rdquo; (p. 4).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He is also not physically fit, as we learn he has &ldquo;a varicose ulcer above his right ankle&rdquo; (p. 3) and a persistent, violent cough (pp. 33-34). It is also suggested that he has an alcohol problem, as he regularly uses gin as a tool to calm his emotions (p. 7).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston is a member of the Outer Party (p. 33), which forms a sort of &lsquo;middle class&rsquo; in London. He therefore wears the &ldquo;blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party&rdquo; (p. 4). Despite this, we get plenty of indications that he is actually living in poverty to some extent, as he struggles to acquire razor blades and his apartment complex is in a poor state.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, which is in charge of making &lsquo;corrections&rsquo; to published stories, images or videos so they fit the version of reality that the Party wants to create (pp. 41-45). Despite his rebellious tendencies (see below), Winston finds some enjoyment in his job, as it occasionally produces intellectual challenges:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston&rsquo;s greatest pleasure in life was his work. Most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem. (p. 46)</span></p><p ><strong>Inner characterisation</strong></p><p><span style="color:black;">Though Winston appears to be a devoted Party member on the outside, his inner characterisation reveals that he has a rebellious nature. Secretly, he is against Big Brother and the oppressive police state which he lives in, even though he knows these rebellious thoughts will probably cost him his life.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">His first, simple act of rebellion is to purchase a diary, in which he secretly writes his real feelings about the Party, such as &ldquo;DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER&rdquo; (p. 20). However, his rebelliousness is combined with a feeling that nothing he does will make any difference, and with a belief in the Party&rsquo;s total control: &ldquo;<em>April 4</em></span><em><sup><span style="color:black;">th</span></sup></em><em><span style="color:black;">, 1984</span></em><span style="color:black;">. He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with he did not know with any certainty that this&nbsp;<em>was&nbsp;</em>1984&rdquo; (p. 9).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Though Winston does participate in mandatory Party activities (e.g. p. 13-18), he is described as more resistant than most to government propaganda. For instance, when the story of the reduced chocolate rations is rewritten, he is amazed at his colleagues&rsquo; readiness to accept the new version of reality: &ldquo;Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. [...] Was he, then,&nbsp;<em>alone</em>&nbsp;in possession of a memory?&rdquo; (pp. 61-62).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, Winston finds it impossible to completely separate himself from the Party&rsquo;s doctrine and control. For instance, during the Two Minutes Hate, he finds himself screaming hatred along with everyone else:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in. (p. 16)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Furthermore, Winston even finds that his feelings oscillate between being orthodox (conventional) and rebellious, suggesting his confusion:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At one moment Winston&rsquo;s hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party and the Thought Police; [&hellip;] And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration. (pp. 16-17)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston feels alone in his rebellious feelings, and he grapples with self-doubt (a recurring feature throughout the book):</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? (pp. 28-29)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He recognises that his actions entail certain death (an understanding which drives many of his future actions). However, once he realises this, he becomes determined to continue his rebellion: &ldquo;Now that he had recognised himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible.&rdquo; (p. 30)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">His rebellious acts grow bolder over time, as he becomes obsessed with learning the truth about what life was like before the Party took power. While the Party denies the existence of external reality, Winston comforts himself with the idea that &ldquo;Truisms are true, hold on to that!&rdquo; (p. 84). He hopes that the proles (the oppressed working classes) will hold answers for him, and his shows an inquisitive nature when he goes into a pub to question an old man. However, he is disappointed when he is not able to learn anything. He eventually returns to the shop where he bought the diary to purchase an old-fashioned decorative paperweight (p. 99) - a thing designed to be useless and beautiful - which is clearly against Party doctrine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Despite Winston&rsquo;s rebellious nature, note that there are also many signs that the violent propaganda of the Party has made him feel&nbsp;<strong>less human empathy</strong>. For example, he feels contempt towards both women (pp. 12, 17) &nbsp;and lower-class citizens (eg. his dismissive attitude towards the proles in the early sections of the story, p. 11), and he has become desensitized to violence in general (eg. he carelessly kicks a severed hand into the gutter, pp. 87-88).</span></p><h3 id="heading-4">Part II</h3><p ><strong>Outer characterisation</strong></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston&rsquo;s appearance changes as he finds happiness in his short-lived relationship with Julia. Both his alcoholism and his general health seem to have changed for the better at this point:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped. (p. 157)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Inspired by Julia, Winston also becomes more skilled at maintaining an appearance of being a loyal Party member. For instance, he signs up for extra hours of uncomfortable volunteer work in an effort to reduce suspicions that he might be a criminal (pp. 135-136).</span></p><p ><strong>Inner characterisation</strong></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston becomes even more rebellious in the second part of the story. First of all, he begins a forbidden relationship with Julia. Though both of them are aware of the danger, they continue to meet in secret in various place, despite the great difficulties of doing so.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The relationship is a great source of happiness to Winston, whose life seems to have taken a turn for the better for the first time. He is able to endure the regular hardships of life much more easily, because he takes comfort in the knowledge of his and Julia&rsquo;s secret place, where they can sometimes go to be free and happy together: &ldquo;What mattered was that the room over the junk shop should exist. To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it&rdquo; (p. 157).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston has not given up on his thoughts about rebellion against the system, however. In fact, he partly sees his affair with Julia as a deliberate act of rebellion: &ldquo;Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act&rdquo; (p. 133).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He tries to discuss political issues with Julia, but she does not take as strong an interest as him, because she is not interested in changing the overall system like him. Winston believes that the system can be changed, but not during his lifetime:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated. She did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse. (p. 142)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, both Winston and Julia believe in the power of the individual, in the sense that they think a person&rsquo;s core emotions will always be safe from the Party&rsquo;s control (pp. 173-174).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston is determined to play an active part in resisting Big Brother&rsquo;s rule, which leads him to seek out O&rsquo;Brien to join the resistance.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston reveals his dedication to the cause of the revolution at this point, highlighted especially by his apparent willingness to commit extraordinary acts of violence and cruelty if it becomes necessary:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;You are prepared to commit murder?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the deaths of hundreds of innocent people?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">[...]</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child&rsquo;s face - are you prepared to do that?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; (pp. 179-180)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">These passages seem oddly out of character for Winston, who has otherwise appeared as a somewhat sympathetic person in the eyes of the reader. However, they point to his wish to believe in the possibility of overthrowing the system, as well his wish to be guided in this by someone he trusts.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston&rsquo;s happiness with Julia is disturbed by the conviction that their luck is bound to run out at some point, since what they are doing is incredibly dangerous. This prediction turns out to be true, as Part II ends with both Winston and Julia being arrested - as they learn that they have been constantly recorded through a hidden telescreen in their hideout. Winston is not surprised that they have been caught, and does not consider trying to run. He accepts that he will be tortured, and merely tries to avoid getting hurt too much (pp. 230-232).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Part II also reveals Winston&rsquo;s crippling fear of rats (p. 151), which becomes very important at the end of Part III. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-5">Part III</h3><p ><strong>Outer characterisation</strong></p><p><span style="color:black;">In Part III of the story, Winston suffers systematic torture within the Ministry of Love. This affects his physical appearance in a very negative way. Disoriented by his treatment in the Ministry, Winston is unaware of how much his appearance has changed until O&rsquo;Brien dramatically reveals it to him with a mirror, using the revelation as yet another kind of psychological torture:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">A bowed, grey-coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. [...] The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. [...] The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease. (p. 284)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">After this dramatic low point, Winston&rsquo;s health and appearance start to improve again as he is slowly allowed to recover once he is brainwashed to follow the Party&rsquo;s ideals more closely (pp. 288-289).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At the very end of the story, Winston has regained his former shape - but we are also told that he is putting on weight and learn that his alcoholism has returned and worsened, suggesting that he is not truly happy in his new, reformed life:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He had grown fatter since they released him and had regained his own colour - indeed, more than regained it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. (p. 301)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">[Gin] had become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death and his resurrection. It was gin that sank him into stupor every night, and that revived him every morning. (p. 307) &nbsp;</span></p><p ><strong>Inner characterisation</strong></p><p><span style="color:black;">Part III is mostly focused on describing the physical and psychological torture Winston suffers within the Ministry of Love, as well as the ways in which he changes in reaction to it.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At first, Winston remains rebellious even in the face of torture. He clings to his negative opinion of Big Brother and the Party&rsquo;s control, and he questions O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s use of&nbsp;<em>doublethink</em>&nbsp;and strange logic even though it leads to further suffering. In his first debates with O&rsquo;Brien, Winston repeatedly tries to argue against O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s belief in the Party&rsquo;s ultimate superiority, even though he struggles to form meaningful&nbsp;arguments:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;I believe it. I know that you will fail. There is something in the universe - I don&rsquo;t know, some spirit, some principle - that you will never overcome.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Do you believe in God, Winston?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The spirit of Man.&rsquo; &nbsp;(p. 282)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In an extended torture session, O&rsquo;Brien tries to force Winston to see five fingers when O&rsquo;Brien holds up four (pp. 261-271). Eventually Winston&rsquo;s mind is broken, and he learns to practice&nbsp;<em>doublethink</em>&nbsp;like a Party member - ignoring the facts of outside reality and replacing them with the Party&rsquo;s version of things:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.[...] He remembered remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. (p. 290)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even at this point, however, he has not surrendered completely, as his innermost feelings remain as they were before. His two core emotions</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;- love of Julia and hatred of Big Brother - are still preserved, and he hopes to keep these emotions intact up to the point of his execution, preserving his inner purity and denying the Party their ultimate victory:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">One day they would decide to shoot him. [&hellip;] In that time the world inside him could turn over [&hellip;] Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. [&hellip;] To die hating them, that was freedom. (p. 294)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, O&rsquo;Brien is fully aware of this flaw in Winston&rsquo;s re-education, and sends him to the terrible Room 101 to complete his transformation. Upon facing his deepest fears - rats - Winston betrays Julia in both words and emotions, destroying his own love for her (pp. 299-300).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At the very end of the book, we also learn that Winston&rsquo;s hatred of Big Brother has finally been replaced with love, making the Party&rsquo;s victory over him total and complete. He has become a completely different person from the rebellious man we met at the beginning of the book, as the Ministry of Love has both broken him down and remade him as a perfectly loyal Party member:</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother. (p. 311)</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="43c63b9c-e32a-4dfa-b973-0034a42a0554">Julia</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Julia is a central character in&nbsp;<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four.&nbsp;</em>She</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;is Winston&rsquo;s secret lover in the middle section of the story.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Her&nbsp;<strong>outer characterisation</strong>&nbsp;is revealed long before we learn her name. She is described as &ldquo;[...] a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick dark hair, a freckled face and swift, athletic movements&rdquo; (p. 11). We later learn in&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">Part II of the novel that Julia is actually 26 years old and lives in a hostel with other women, whom she professes to hate (p. 136).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">She is a member of the Outer Party and works in the Ministry of Truth in the Fiction Department, which mostly means that she produces an endless stream of trivial entertainment products that are meant to keep the &lsquo;proles&rsquo; satisfied and stop them from questioning their situation. Her job does not involve actual writing - instead she operates some kind of machine used as part of the printing process. Winston &ldquo;had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner&rdquo; (p. 11), suggesting that she is a mechanic. We also learn that: &ldquo;A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times around the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips&rdquo; (p. 12).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Initially, this makes Winston believe that Julia&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>inner characterisation&nbsp;</strong>must be that of a typical Party-loving woman: &ldquo;It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her&rdquo; (p. 12). However, this is a mistake as this is merely the&nbsp;<strong>façade</strong>&nbsp;that Julia presents to the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;">She is extremely skilled at appearing to be a loyal Party member on the outside:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. [...] I always carry one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheerful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that&rsquo;s what I say. (p. 128)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After making the practical arrangements to meet with Winston, Julia reveals something about herself in Part II of the novel. Although she is part of the Anti-Sex League and appears pure, she has been having affairs for a long time:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen&hellip; Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it was quite simple. You wanted a good time; &lsquo;they&rsquo;, meaning the Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could" (p. 137).&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;">Julia manages to avoid being taken in by the Party&rsquo;s propaganda and manages to remain separate from it to a greater degree than Winston (p. 160). For example, during the Two Minutes Hate (in which Winston finds himself caught up), her greatest difficulty is in stopping herself from laughing (p. 160).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Like Winston, Julia is critical towards the Party. However, her rebellion is mostly centred on her own life - she is focused on finding as many pleasures in life as possible, evading the Party&rsquo;s rules to do so, but does not have any grand ambitions of revolution and societal change (at least not initially):</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">[...] she only questioned the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. (p. 160)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">She believes that the Party wants to drive out the sex-instinct and to channel the population&rsquo;s sexual energy into war-energy or hatred of foreigners. For Julia, this is key to why she dislikes the Party: &ldquo;With Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality&hellip;. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party&rsquo;s sexual puritanism&rdquo; (p. 139). Winston tells Julia, &ldquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re only a rebel from the waist downwards&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 163), jokingly suggesting that her only interest in evading the Party&rsquo;s rule is due to her sexuality.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Julia wants to feel both sexual and feminine, which is emphasised by the fact that she buys make-up (which is forbidden) and wears perfume for Winston:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;m going to do next? I&rsquo;m going to get hold of a real woman&rsquo;s frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. I&rsquo;ll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I&rsquo;m going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.&rsquo; (p. 149)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, she does agree to join Winston when he seeks out the secret resistance movement known as the Brotherhood, suggesting that she is starting to believe a little more in the possibility of rebellion - or simply that she is so devoted to Winston that she is willing to do it for his sake. During the meeting with O&rsquo;Brien, she is mostly passive, though she shows passion when she refuses to be separated from Winston (p. 180).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even after joining the Brotherhood, she seems less enthusiastic about it than Winston. For example, Winston is completely absorbed in Goldstein&rsquo;s book, which explains the political situation in Oceania, but Julia seems bored by it - even falling asleep as he tries to read it to her (p. 226).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Though we never directly see witness what happens to Julia within the Ministry of Love in the third part of the story, it is implied that she goes through a process similar to Winston - most likely concluded by being brought to Room 101 to face&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;greatest fear. We never learn what this fear is, though it is notable that Julia has a long scar across her forehead when Winston meets her again afterwards (p. 304). Her outer characterisation has changed by the end, just as Winston&rsquo;s has:</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by her hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had thickened. (pp. 304-305)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We learn that she betrayed her love for Winston at the Ministry of Love, just as he betrayed her, and their feelings for each other have therefore ended. After their final scene together, we get no more information about what happens to Julia. We may assume that she is in a similar situation to Winston, however - having been broken and remade by the Party, she is merely awaiting her execution, just as he is.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">On a symbolical level, Julia&rsquo;s name might be a reference to William Shakespeare&rsquo;s famous story of&nbsp;<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>&nbsp;- another tragic tale of two lovers who are forced to meet in secret to avoid the judgement of society. This theory is further supported by the fact that Orwell makes several other allusions to Shakespeare throughout the novel, most notably following an early dream that Winston has about Julia (p. 33).</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="7170bf8b-7111-4346-9ea3-a702ebfdf4ae">O'Brien</h2><p><span style="color:black;">O&rsquo;Brien is a mysterious figure at the beginning of the book.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">His&nbsp;<strong>outer characterisation</strong>&nbsp;describes him as a &ldquo;[...] large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous brutal face&rdquo;, but also notes that he has &ldquo;a certain charm of manner&rdquo; (p. 12). In particular, the narrator refers to O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s &ldquo;trick of re-settling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming &ndash; in some indefinable way, curiously civilised&rdquo; (p. 12).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He is a member of the Inner Party, which means he enjoys a level of luxury unknown to the majority of citizens in Oceania. The description of his neighbourhood and home marks a stark contrast to the residential areas described in the rest of the book:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">[...] the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro&hellip; (p. 175)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s true&nbsp;<strong>inner characterisation</strong>&nbsp;is kept hidden in most of the book. In Part I, Winston only knows very little about him. Even so, he does feel a curious attraction to him, observing that O&rsquo;Brien &ldquo;had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to&rdquo; (p. 13). Winston even suspects that O&rsquo;Brien is sceptical towards the Party&rsquo;s rule, just as himself (p. 19).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In Part II, Winston becomes falsely convinced that O&rsquo;Brien belongs to the Brotherhood, the secret resistance movement against Big Brother&rsquo;s rule.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, in Part III the full truth is finally revealed. O&rsquo;Brien is, in fact, a dedicated member of the Inner Party and was only pretending to belong to the Brotherhood to lure Winston (and, presumably, others like him) into a trap, giving him full insight into their rebellious mindset, helping him to brainwash them once they have been captured.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">O&rsquo;Brien is clearly a very intelligent man. He expresses himself well and is very good at anticipating Winston&rsquo;s counterarguments and shooting them down through his in-depth knowledge of the Party&rsquo;s mission. On many occasions it almost seems as if he is able to read Winston&rsquo;s mind - such is his level of psychological insight:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness. O&rsquo;Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought aloud. [...]</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;You are thinking,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that since we intend to destroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference - in that case, why do we go through the trouble of interrogating you first? That is what you were thinking, was it not?&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Winston. (p. 267)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At the same time, O&rsquo;Brien reveals himself as a true master of&nbsp;<em>doublethink</em>&nbsp;- the ability to keep several conflicting ideas in one&rsquo;s mind at the same time. Despite his full understanding that the Party is systematically altering the truth, he is capable of convincing himself that the new truth does, in fact, represent reality. We see a clear example of&nbsp;<em>doublethink</em>&nbsp;when he shows Winston the picture of Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford, only to destroy it immediately afterwards:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Ashes,&rsquo; [O&rsquo;Brien] said. &lsquo;Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist. It never existed.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;I do not remember it,&rsquo; said O&rsquo;Brien.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston&rsquo;s heart sank. That was doublethink. (p. 259) &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Because of his mastery of&nbsp;<em>doublethink</em>, O&rsquo;Brien can stay fanatically devoted to the Party despite being fully aware of what its methods and end goals truly are. His dark description of humanity&rsquo;s future - delivered with disturbing enthusiasm - gives us a very direct view of his ruthless and brutal nature:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless at it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. [...] There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. [...] If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - for ever.&rsquo; (p. 280)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">O&rsquo;Brien is a frightening character - to both Winston and the reader - because he combines this ruthlessness and brutality with his unusual level of intelligence and human insight. The thing that truly disturbs Winston is that O&rsquo;Brien continues to believe in the Party&rsquo;s project despite being fully aware of the horrors it is responsible for - and despite having a complete understanding of all of Winston&rsquo;s possible objections to it.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">O&rsquo;Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O&rsquo;Brien had not long ago known, examined and rejected. His mind contained Winston&rsquo;s mind. But in that case how could it be true that O&rsquo;Brien was mad? (p. 268)</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="structure.html" title="Structure 1984" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Structure</span></a><a href="characters/other.html" title="Other characters 1984" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Other characters</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party\u0026rsquo;s sexual puritanism\u0026rdquo; (p. 139). Winston tells Julia, \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;You\u0026rsquo;re only a rebel from the waist downwards\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 163), jokingly suggesting that her only interest in evading the Party\u0026rsquo;s rule is due to her sexuality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eJulia wants to feel both sexual and feminine, which is emphasised by the fact that she buys make-up (which is forbidden) and wears perfume for Winston:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;Do you know what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do next?

During the meeting with O\u0026rsquo;Brien, she is mostly passive, though she shows passion when she refuses to be separated from Winston (p. 180).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eEven after joining the Brotherhood, she seems less enthusiastic about it than Winston.

After their final scene together, we get no more information about what happens to Julia. We may assume that she is in a similar situation to Winston, however - having been broken and remade by the Party, she is merely awaiting her execution, just as he is.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eOn a symbolical level, Julia\u0026rsquo;s name might be a reference to William Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s famous story of\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eRomeo and Juliet\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;- another tragic tale of two lovers who are forced to meet in secret to avoid the judgement of society.

His dark description of humanity\u0026rsquo;s future - delivered with disturbing enthusiasm - gives us a very direct view of his ruthless and brutal nature:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless at it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. [...] There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy.

The thing that truly disturbs Winston is that O\u0026rsquo;Brien continues to believe in the Party\u0026rsquo;s project despite being fully aware of the horrors it is responsible for - and despite having a complete understanding of all of Winston\u0026rsquo;s possible objections to it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eO\u0026rsquo;Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O\u0026rsquo;Brien had not long ago known, examined and rejected. His mind contained Winston\u0026rsquo;s mind. But in that case how could it be true that O\u0026rsquo;Brien was mad?
