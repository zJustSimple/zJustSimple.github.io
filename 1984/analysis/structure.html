The contemporary reader would probably have been instantly curious to see how the author might describe this unknown, distant future.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Of course, readers today would instead see a year a few decades in the&nbsp;<em>past</em>, and so the title might create different expectations in them. For example, they might wonder whether Orwell&rsquo;s future scenario presented an accurate view of the realities of 1984 in any way, or whether any of his predictions about the future have come true.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Orwell at first meant the book to be set in&nbsp;<em>1980</em>, but as the manuscript took several years to complete, he adjusted the proposed time setting several times as well. In the end, Orwell settled on 1984 because it was a reversal of the last two digits of 1948 - the year when he worked on the final version of the novel (which was finally published in 1949).</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="5ac66f5e-4031-43c2-9f8f-7387fab8e6ac">Beginning (Part I)</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The story begins&nbsp;<strong>in medias res</strong>, starting with the famous sentence: &ldquo;It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.&rdquo; (p. 3).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Because&nbsp;<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>&nbsp;is a science-fiction story, the first part of the book serves to introduce us to its rather unusual&nbsp;<strong>setting</strong>, giving us detailed descriptions of the social and political mechanics of London in the future world of 1984. We quickly learn that the society of the future is a&nbsp;totalitarian state&nbsp;that relies on mass surveillance to keep the citizens under strict control (pp. 4-5), led by the mysterious Big Brother, who can be seen on posters all over the city (pp. 3-4).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At the same time, the&nbsp;<strong>main conflict</strong>&nbsp;is introduced. Our main character, Winston Smith, is a member of the Outer Party, but is secretly against the Party&rsquo;s rule. In the early sections of the book, this mostly comes across as small acts of rebellion. For example, he purchases a blank book and starts a diary (p. 8), and he acquires an ornamental paperweight from an antiques shop (p. 99). However, despite these seemingly minor crimes, he is fully aware of the possible consequences:</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.&nbsp;(p. 8)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Part I also briefly introduces us to O&rsquo;Brien (p. 12) and Julia (p. 11), the two other central characters of the story, though we learn relatively little about them in this section of the story, because Winston himself does not know much yet (Julia&rsquo;s name is not even revealed until Part II, and most of his assumptions about her turn out to be wrong). There is an element of&nbsp;<strong>foreshadowing</strong>&nbsp;in the glance Winston shares with O&rsquo;Brien (p. 19), though neither Winston nor the reader fully understand what it means at this point. Winston assumes it means that O&rsquo;Brien is on his side, but the glance actually shows that O&rsquo;Brien is onto him and wish to convert him to the Party&rsquo;s ways.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">As the first part of the story continues, Winston becomes increasingly obsessed with understanding how and why the Party rose to power - and possibly discovering what the past might have been like. He tries to find information among the lower-class &lsquo;proles&rsquo;, but it is difficult to find useful knowledge (pp. 90-97).</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:black;">Tension</span></strong><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;is created through Winston&rsquo;s increasing suspicions that the Thought Police are aware of his actions. He is particularly concerned about Julia, whom he suspects to be either a full member of the Thought Police or simply an amateur detective who would be willing to turn him over to the authorities (pp. 64-65). He eventually becomes convinced that she is aware of his crimes when he sees her in an unfamiliar area of the city, as that cannot possibly be coincidental (pp. 104-105).</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="4a918456-4511-4b2b-9395-ba476eb8fe50">Middle (Part II)</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The second part of the book starts with Winston&rsquo;s first true meeting with Julia, in which she hands him a note declaring her love for him (p. 111-114). This leads to their secret love affair, which allows both of them a temporary escape from the dark and hopeless reality they live in.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The middle section is the most optimistic and hopeful part of the book, though ongoing&nbsp;<strong>tension</strong>&nbsp;is still created because of the secrecy of Winston and Julia&rsquo;s relationship and the constant fear that they might be discovered. They rent a small room above Mr. Charrington&rsquo;s junk shop, where they believe themselves to be safe. This leads to a minor tension point where Winston&rsquo;s fear of rats is revealed (p. 151), which both&nbsp;<strong>foreshadows</strong>&nbsp;his final tortures within the Ministry of Love.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">A&nbsp;<strong>backstory</strong>&nbsp;reveals detail about Winston&rsquo;s childhood and his relationship to his sister and mother, as well as Winston&rsquo;s ongoing guilt about his selfish behaviour towards them (pp. 167-171).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">A major&nbsp;<strong>tension point</strong>&nbsp;occurs when Winston and Julia decide to announce themselves to O&rsquo;Brien, based on Winston&rsquo;s instinct that he can be trusted. It seems their trust is rewarded, as O&rsquo;Brien tells them that he is a member of the secret Brotherhood working against Big Brother&rsquo;s rule - under the leadership of Goldstein. Winston and Julia decide to join without hesitation, conforming that they are willing to do everything &ndash; from murdering large numbers of people to throwing acid in a child&rsquo;s face &ndash; except leaving each other (p. 180).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Winston borrows Goldstein&rsquo;s famous, forbidden book which describes the nature and origins of the political power structure in society. We read along as he reads the book, getting a much more detailed understanding of the story&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>setting</strong>&nbsp;in the process. These sections also serve as a&nbsp;<strong>backstory</strong>&nbsp;of how the society of Nineteen Eighty-Four came into being, suggesting it happened in the aftermath of a nuclear war between the superpowers in the middle of the 20</span><sup><span style="color:black;">th</span></sup><span style="color:black;">century (p. 197). &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The<strong>&nbsp;point of no return&nbsp;</strong>and dramatic climax of the middle section&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">of the story happens when Winston and Julia&rsquo;s hideout is attacked by the police, and it is revealed that &lsquo;Mr. Charrington&rsquo; has been a member of the Thought Police all along:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;We are the dead,&rsquo; he said.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;We are the dead,&rsquo; echoed Julia dutifully.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;You are the dead,&rsquo; said an iron voice behind them. (p. 230);</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">It occurred to Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police. (p. 234)</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="59837035-c8ad-49a9-baa9-54f642e6f74f">Ending (Part III)</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The final part of the story mainly takes place within the Ministry of Love, the government&rsquo;s law enforcement and torture headquarters.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Within the Ministry, Winston is subjected to all kinds of torture and gradually his will is broken down. First, he is merely beaten by the guards like a common prisoner, but afterwards he is subjected to advanced psychological torture at the hands of members of the Inner Party. Eventually, O&rsquo;Brien arrives and reveals he was lying about being a member of the Brotherhood - and he assumes control of the effort to break down Winston completely.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Though Winston eventually surrenders his mind to the Party&rsquo;s teachings, he remains unwilling to give up his love for Julia. He is then taken to the mysterious Room 101 in which prisoners face their greatest fears (in Winston&rsquo;s case, being eaten alive by rats). Winston is unable to endure it and in the story&rsquo;s disturbing&nbsp;<strong>climax&nbsp;</strong>he</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;finally surrenders his love for Julia as well:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then &ndash; no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment &ndash; one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&lsquo;Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don&rsquo;t care what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!&rsquo; (pp. 299-300)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">During the&nbsp;<strong>falling action&nbsp;</strong>in the last scene of the book, Winston has been released from prison. His mind has been changed to that of a loyal Party member and he lives a quiet life, spending most of his time at the Chestnut Tree Caf&eacute;. As the telescreen describes a great military victory, Winston finally realises that he truly loves Big Brother. This is also the&nbsp;<strong>resolution:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggled was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother&rdquo; (p. 311).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The ending of the story is mostly&nbsp;<strong>closed</strong>. Though Winston is no longer physically imprisoned, he has completely surrendered to the Party&rsquo;s way of thinking and it seems unlikely that he will go back to his rebellious ways. His sad encounter with Julia further highlights that there is no possibility for their relationship to continue, as their mutual betrayals have destroyed their love (pp. 304-306). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">It is also heavily implied that Winston will be executed in the near future, as the whole point of converting him to the Party&rsquo;s ways was that they could not allow him to die as a rebel (pp. 267-268). His death is further&nbsp;<strong>foreshadowed</strong>&nbsp;by the fact that he spends his time at the Chestnut Tree Caf&eacute;, just as the traitors Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford did in the period between their release from imprisonment and their executions (pp. 80-81).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Furthermore, O&rsquo;Brien made a direct promise to Winston about his death during his imprisonment: &ldquo;[...] don&rsquo;t give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later.

In the end, Orwell settled on 1984 because it was a reversal of the last two digits of 1948 - the year when he worked on the final version of the novel (which was finally published in 1949).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00225ac66f5e-4031-43c2-9f8f-7387fab8e6ac\u0022\u003eBeginning (Part I)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe story begins\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ein medias res\u003c/strong\u003e, starting with the famous sentence: \u0026ldquo;It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\u0026rdquo; (p. 3).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eBecause\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eNineteen Eighty-Four\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;is a science-fiction story, the first part of the book serves to introduce us to its rather unusual\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003esetting\u003c/strong\u003e, giving us detailed descriptions of the social and political mechanics of London in the future world of 1984. We quickly learn that the society of the future is a\u0026nbsp;totalitarian state\u0026nbsp;that relies on mass surveillance to keep the citizens under strict control (pp. 4-5), led by the mysterious Big Brother, who can be seen on posters all over the city (pp. 3-4).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt the same time, the\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003emain conflict\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;is introduced. Our main character, Winston Smith, is a member of the Outer Party, but is secretly against the Party\u0026rsquo;s rule. In the early sections of the book, this mostly comes across as small acts of rebellion. For example, he purchases a blank book and starts a diary (p. 8), and he acquires an ornamental paperweight from an antiques shop (p. 99). However, despite these seemingly minor crimes, he is fully aware of the possible consequences:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThis was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.\u0026nbsp;(p. 8)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003ePart I also briefly introduces us to O\u0026rsquo;Brien (p. 12) and Julia (p. 11), the two other central characters of the story, though we learn relatively little about them in this section of the story, because Winston himself does not know much yet (Julia\u0026rsquo;s name is not even revealed until Part II, and most of his assumptions about her turn out to be wrong). There is an element of\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eforeshadowing\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;in the glance Winston shares with O\u0026rsquo;Brien (p. 19), though neither Winston nor the reader fully understand what it means at this point. Winston assumes it means that O\u0026rsquo;Brien is on his side, but the glance actually shows that O\u0026rsquo;Brien is onto him and wish to convert him to the Party\u0026rsquo;s ways.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAs the first part of the story continues, Winston becomes increasingly obsessed with understanding how and why the Party rose to power - and possibly discovering what the past might have been like. He tries to find information among the lower-class \u0026lsquo;proles\u0026rsquo;, but it is difficult to find useful knowledge (pp. 90-97).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTension\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003e\u0026nbsp;is created through Winston\u0026rsquo;s increasing suspicions that the Thought Police are aware of his actions. He is particularly concerned about Julia, whom he suspects to be either a full member of the Thought Police or simply an amateur detective who would be willing to turn him over to the authorities (pp. 64-65). He eventually becomes convinced that she is aware of his crimes when he sees her in an unfamiliar area of the city, as that cannot possibly be coincidental (pp. 104-105).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00224a918456-4511-4b2b-9395-ba476eb8fe50\u0022\u003eMiddle (Part II)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe second part of the book starts with Winston\u0026rsquo;s first true meeting with Julia, in which she hands him a note declaring her love for him (p. 111-114).

They rent a small room above Mr. Charrington\u0026rsquo;s junk shop, where they believe themselves to be safe.

It seems their trust is rewarded, as O\u0026rsquo;Brien tells them that he is a member of the secret Brotherhood working against Big Brother\u0026rsquo;s rule - under the leadership of Goldstein. Winston and Julia decide to join without hesitation, conforming that they are willing to do everything \u0026ndash; from murdering large numbers of people to throwing acid in a child\u0026rsquo;s face \u0026ndash; except leaving each other (p. 180).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinston borrows Goldstein\u0026rsquo;s famous, forbidden book which describes the nature and origins of the political power structure in society.

Though Winston is no longer physically imprisoned, he has completely surrendered to the Party\u0026rsquo;s way of thinking and it seems unlikely that he will go back to his rebellious ways. His sad encounter with Julia further highlights that there is no possibility for their relationship to continue, as their mutual betrayals have destroyed their love (pp. 304-306). \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIt is also heavily implied that Winston will be executed in the near future, as the whole point of converting him to the Party\u0026rsquo;s ways was that they could not allow him to die as a rebel (pp. 267-268). His death is further\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eforeshadowed\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;by the fact that he spends his time at the Chestnut Tree Caf\u0026eacute;, just as the traitors Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford did in the period between their release from imprisonment and their executions (pp. 80-81).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eFurthermore, O\u0026rsquo;Brien made a direct promise to Winston about his death during his imprisonment: \u0026ldquo;[...] don\u0026rsquo;t give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shall shoot you.\u0026rdquo; (p. 287), and Winston even has a vision of being shot right before the story ends, considering death to be a release (p. 311).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Structure 1984","MetaDescription":"The novel’s title Nineteen Eighty-Four is meant to describe the approximate year the story takes place in, even though Winston himself admits that it is impossible to know whether this is accurate, as (…)","IsPublished":true,"RedirectToLogin":false},"localizations":{"SearchContentPlaceholder":"Caută în 1984 by George Orwell","PreviousPage":"Anterior","NextPage":"Următoarea","FavouriteDeselect":"Anulează preferința","FavouriteSelect":"Selectează ca favorit","FavouriteNotificationDeselect":"eBook-ul a fost eliminat din lista de preferate.","FavouriteNotificationSelect":"Ai marcat acest eBook ca favorit.
