Winston lives in London (a city within the superstate of Oceania) in an unpleasant apartment complex. Both his apartment and the whole city are under constant surveillance by the government, who use devices called&nbsp;<em>telescreens</em>&nbsp;to watch and listen to everyone while also transmitting constant propaganda. We also learn that society is regulated by something known as the Thought Police.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">London is dominated by four enormous buildings that house the four ministries that control society - the Ministry of Truth (where Winston works), the Ministry of Peace, the Ministry of Love and the Ministry of Plenty. The entire city is covered with posters of Big Brother, the mysterious leader of the Party which rules the entire state.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Taking advantage of a corner hidden from the telescreen, Winston begins a secret diary as an act of protest against the Party&rsquo;s rule. As he writes, he recalls an incident from earlier in the day.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">While the workers in Winston&rsquo;s department were preparing for something called the Two Minutes Hate, Winston observed a dark-haired girl whom Winston regards with contempt and suspicion, as well as a member of the Inner Party named O&rsquo;Brien, whom Winston feels mysteriously drawn to.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">During the Two Minutes Hate, a video of the traitor Emmanuel Goldstein is played, carefully designed to incite people&rsquo;s anger. Despite being caught up in the anger, Winston does not truly believe in this propaganda. Afterwards, he exchanges a sceptical look with O&rsquo;Brien, which leads him to believe that O&rsquo;Brien is on his side.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Returning to the present in the apartment, Winston resumes writing his diary. He reflects that starting the diary was a death sentence but resolves to evade the Thought Police for as long as possible.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The following day, Winston goes to work. His job involves adjusting official records to match the &lsquo;facts&rsquo; that the Party wants people to believe in.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">During his lunch break, he talks to a colleague named Syme, who works on the development of Newspeak - a constructed language designed to make it difficult to express or think rebellious thoughts. Winston notices the dark-haired girl staring at him. This makes him nervous, as he suspects her to be a government spy.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">We skip to another scene where Winston writes in his diary about an encounter with a prostitute ad about his unhappy, childless marriage to Katharine, which ended in separation. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston becomes increasingly obsessed with learning about what the past was like before the Party took control, as he is aware that the official stories are untrustworthy. One day, he goes for a long walk in the district of the proles, the lower-class citizens of Oceania, whom Winston believes may be able to tell him about the past. At first his attempts prove unsuccessful, but eventually he goes to a junk shop owned by a kindly old man named Mr. Charrington, who seems willing to talk about London of the past. Winston learns that Mr. Charrington even has an old-fashioned room above his shop, containing furniture from the time before the Party&rsquo;s rule.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After buying a coral paperweight from Mr. Charrington, Winston heads home. He panics as he notices the dark-haired girl following him, convinced he has been discovered.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="22398af9-0c69-4226-9c33-30ebbc47b95d">Part II</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Four days later, Winston meets the dark-haired girl again. She hands him a love-note in secret, and Winston becomes obsessed with the idea of meeting her, even though relationships between unmarried Party members are forbidden. With some difficulty, they manage to arrange a meeting in a secret location in the countryside.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston learns that the girl&rsquo;s name is Julia, and that she has had feelings for him for some time. They have sex and go their separate ways, but resolve to meet again. In the following weeks, Winston and Julia&rsquo;s relationship develops as they learn more about each other, though getting together is still difficult, as they both have heavy workloads and constantly have to change hiding places.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Because of these difficulties, Winston eventually comes up with a plan to rent the room above Mr. Charrington&rsquo;s shop and use it as a permanent hiding place, despite the danger. This becomes Julia and Winston&rsquo;s secret hideout in the coming weeks, where they find some happiness in their otherwise dark lives.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">One day at work, Winston meets O&rsquo;Brien again. O&rsquo;Brien comes up with an excuse to share his address with Winston, and uses a reference which Winston interprets as a secret message - and a sign that O&rsquo;Brien belongs to the mysterious Brotherhood, an underground resistance movement against the Party&rsquo;s rule.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston and Julia have a conversation where they reflect on the fact that they will eventually be caught and tortured. They agree that there is no way they can avoid revealing the other person&rsquo;s identity during torture, but are convinced that their innermost thoughts and emotions - especially the love they feel for each other - cannot be altered.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston and Julia go to see O&rsquo;Brien. They declare themselves willing to join the Brotherhood, and O&rsquo;Brien accepts their request. He tells them to await further instructions, and lets them know that he will arrange for them to get a copy of&nbsp;<em>the book</em>&nbsp;- Emmanuel Goldstein&rsquo;s secret, forbidden work about the political reality of Oceania.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston receives his copy and manages to read some sections of it in the hiding place above Mr. Charrington&rsquo;s shop. The book reveals detailed information about the Party&rsquo;s rule and how they have managed to stay in power for so long.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">While Winston and Julia are in the hiding place together, a voice calls out from the wall and reveals that the Party have been spying on them from the beginning. They are arrested, and it is revealed that &lsquo;Mr. Charrington&rsquo; was in fact a disguised member of the Thought Police.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="3debaafa-7419-4426-9de9-948c193323db">Part III</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston is taken to a white, featureless cell within the Ministry of Love. While Winston is there other prisoners come and go, including some of Winston&rsquo;s former colleagues from the Ministry of Truth, which have all been guilty of various&nbsp;<em>thoughtcrimes</em>. Some of the prisoners are sent to a place called &lsquo;Room 101&rsquo;, which has a terrifying reputation.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">O&rsquo;Brien finally arrives, and it is revealed that he was only pretending to belong to the Brotherhood - in fact, he is a dedicated member of the Inner Party.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston is tortured both physically and psychologically. He is eventually prepared to make all kinds of fake confessions, but his thoughts and emotions remain his own. O&rsquo;Brien takes him to a special torture chamber and uses an advanced device to inflict systematic pain while training Winston to think like a Party member and give up his commitment to the truth.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Winston at first tries to resist, but slowly his will is broken. Eventually, he learns to convince himself that the Party&rsquo;s lies are actually true. However, he secretly holds on to his love for Julia and his hatred of Big Brother.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Realising that Winston is not completely won over, O&rsquo;Brien brings him to the terrible Room 101. Winston is confronted with his worst fear - being eaten alive by rats - and desperately asks for Julia to be tortured instead. Having finally betrayed his love for her, Winston is released from the Ministry.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The final scene depicts a brainwashed, alcoholic Winston hanging around in a caf&eacute;. A flashback shows his final encounter with Julia, where they both admitted to having betrayed each other and realised that their relationship was now dead. Back at the caf&eacute;, a propaganda message reveals that Oceania just achieved a major victory in the war.

Despite being caught up in the anger, Winston does not truly believe in this propaganda. Afterwards, he exchanges a sceptical look with O\u0026rsquo;Brien, which leads him to believe that O\u0026rsquo;Brien is on his side.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eReturning to the present in the apartment, Winston resumes writing his diary.

One day, he goes for a long walk in the district of the proles, the lower-class citizens of Oceania, whom Winston believes may be able to tell him about the past. At first his attempts prove unsuccessful, but eventually he goes to a junk shop owned by a kindly old man named Mr. Charrington, who seems willing to talk about London of the past. Winston learns that Mr. Charrington even has an old-fashioned room above his shop, containing furniture from the time before the Party\u0026rsquo;s rule.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eAfter buying a coral paperweight from Mr. Charrington, Winston heads home.
