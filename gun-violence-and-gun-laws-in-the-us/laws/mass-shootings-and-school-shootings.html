Usually, the perpetrator kills people in a public place indiscriminately. A particular type of mass shooting in the US is&nbsp;<strong>school shooting</strong>. A school shooting refers to multiple people being killed in a school area, usually by someone connected with that school.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Reactions to mass shootings vary. Usually, the media covers the sensational aspects of the incidents. The families of the victims generally protest and often demand stricter gun control, alongside other gun control activists. Politicians can use the events to advocate for the same thing&nbsp;or to argue in favor of gun rights, depending on which side they stand on.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In the following, we will take a look at&nbsp;some of the most recent and important mass shootings that have taken place in the United States.</span></p><h2 id="heading-1" data-guid="09daef20-e0b9-46d5-84fa-57d3a57c93ec">The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The shooting was committed in 2012 by a 20-year-old man who shot 20 children aged 6 and 7 at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Before the school shooting, he also killed his mother. The man killed himself immediately after he shot the children. Police investigation revealed that the shooter had planned the attack and that he was suffering from a series of mental conditions including depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The incident was one of the deadliest school shootings in American history and led to a&nbsp;<strong>debate over gun control and proposals for increased background checks before allowing individuals to buy firearms</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">There were immediate political reactions to the shootings. These included a televised speech by the US President Barack Obama who advocated for taking action to prevent such events in the future.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">NGOs started petitioning for tighter background checks, but all legislative initiatives regarding this matter failed to pass in Congress.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">At the same time, the NRA argued that the gun-free school zones actually attract killers and any other restrictions would make the matter worse. The case also opened a debate about video games, as the shooter was known to play violent video games very often.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="866b1b76-f203-4ac3-9eed-3e0c9d41f4b4">The 2016&nbsp;Orlando night club mass shooting</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The shooting was committed by a man who worked as a security guard. He killed 49 people and injured another 53 at a gay night club. He was killed by the police three hours later. Most of the victims were&nbsp;gay men, making the shooting the deadliest one against the LGBTQ community in the US.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The shooting was considered a terrorist attack because the shooter declared his allegiance to the the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) during the incident. He also claimed that he was shooting because of the US operations in Iraq and Syria.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After the shooting, President Barack Obama ordered an investigation and asked the federal government to assist the community. American Muslims condemned the shooting. The shooting was also condemned by the United Nations as well as by a large number of individual countries (though&nbsp;many of the countries which condemned the shooting do&nbsp;not support gay rights inside their own territory).</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="eb60768d-5f4b-4767-b7e1-3fd1fcf768c2">The 2017 mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The shooting took place inside a Baptist church in November 2017 when a 26-year-old man killed 26 people and injured 20 others. He was shot at the scene by a local resident and NRA member&nbsp;but managed to flee in a car. His car crashed, and the police found the shooter dead, shot in the head.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The incident was the deadliest mass shooting in Texas. The shooter&nbsp;had no right to own guns after he had been convicted in a martial court when he was in the United States Air Force. Because he was able to buy guns, the Air Force started reviewing its internal procedures regarding gun ownership prohibition data.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The investigation could not establish any other motive for the killing except a conflict between the shooter and his mother-in-law. However, he had a history of violent behaviour, as he had previously been charged for assault on his wife, assault on his stepson, and threats with loaded and unloaded guns.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The attack raised awareness about&nbsp;<strong>gaps in reporting to the federal background-check system intended to prohibit convicted people from buying guns.</strong></span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In the wake of the events, President Trump argued that the problem was mental illness and not gun laws. He also mentioned the &ldquo;good guy with a gun&rdquo; argument saying it was good that another person with a gun managed to shoot the perpetrator and prevent more killings. The Texas Attorney General recommended that churches hire armed security guards.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Far-right activists and media came up with conspiracy theories claiming that the shooter was a Democrat connected with Hillary Clinton or that he was a Muslim.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="a2b96c93-f3bf-4e9b-a9fd-ee0421658fbc">The 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Las Vegas mass shooting took place in October 2017 when a shooter opened fire on a crowd of people going to a concert. In the shooting, 53 people died and over 800 were injured. The perpetrator was a man aged 64. He fired over 1000 rounds of bullets from his hotel room window before killing himself. The motive behind the shooting is still unknown.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The shooting now ranks as the deadliest mass shooting committed by one person in US history. Because the shooter fired with semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks, the event opened the&nbsp;<strong>debate about gun control and allowing guns with bump stocks (which function like an automatic weapon)</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval condemned the attack, while President Donald Trump described the shooter as demented and praised police work. Trump refused to talk about tighter gun control.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However,&nbsp;US Congress started discussing legislation that would ban bump stocks, legislation that was also supported by the NRA. While federal legislation has not been passed yet, the state of Massachusetts banned the sale and use of bump stocks.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Since no clear motive for the murders could be established, various conspiracy theories emerged. The terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) claimed that the shooter was doing their work. Other reports claimed that the shooter had terrorist links, while some even argued that he was a Democrat.</span></p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="d4d92191-80d3-4304-af51-6462abdfb551">The&nbsp;2018 school shooting at Santa Fe High School</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The latest severe mass shooting in the US is the Santa Fe High School shooting from May 2018. 10 people died and 13 others were injured in the incident. The shooter was&nbsp;a teenage student at the school. He surrendered to the police after he was injured.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The shooter used to be bullied by classmates. He also declared that he wanted to kill most of his classmates, except those he liked. The investigation revealed that he planned the attack in advance and that he wanted to kill himself afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">President Trump expressed condolences and said&nbsp;that he was&nbsp;determined to keep schools safe. Democrats argued that gun laws need to be changed. Texas officials refused to consider stricter gun control and argued that the problem is with people and not with guns.</span></p><h2 id="heading-h0b21" data-guid="182f2350-10e5-4252-aff2-e4520215a250"><strong>The 2019 mass shootings in Texas and Ohio</strong></h2><p>In August 2019, two devastating mass shootings occurred within 13 hours of each other.</p><p>The first shooting took place on Saturday, August 3 in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. The suspect, Patrick Crusius, opened fire on the crowd and killed at least 22 people before he was arrested. Most disturbingly, the suspect had previously posted an online manifesto describing his white supremacist beliefs and suggesting that the shooting was his response to a Hispanic &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; of the US. Because of these factors, police are considering bringing hate crime charges against the suspect.</p><p>The second shooting took place on Sunday, August 4 in Dayton, Ohio. The shooter killed 9 people in the streets, but police officers were close to the scene and the shooter was killed before he could continue his attack further. Unlike the El Paso shooting, the motives behind the Dayton attack are unclear.</p><p>Once again, the prospect of political action from the Republican government seemed limited in the wake of the shootings, as they tried to steer the rhetoric towards mental health and violent video games, instead of opening a debate about gun control. The special circumstances of the El Paso attack did lead President Donald Trump to make a statement opposing racism, though critics argued that this statement did not seem entirely convincing, given that the shooter&rsquo;s rhetoric in his manifesto to some extent echoed Trump&rsquo;s own aggressive rhetoric towards Hispanic immigrants.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../laws.html" title="Gun laws in the US" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Gun laws in the US</span></a><a href="../the-debate.html" title="The gun debate in the US" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The gun debate in the US</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The suspect, Patrick Crusius, opened fire on the crowd and killed at least 22 people before he was arrested. Most disturbingly, the suspect had previously posted an online manifesto describing his white supremacist beliefs and suggesting that the shooting was his response to a Hispanic \u0026ldquo;invasion\u0026rdquo; of the US. Because of these factors, police are considering bringing hate crime charges against the suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second shooting took place on Sunday, August 4 in Dayton, Ohio. The shooter killed 9 people in the streets, but police officers were close to the scene and the shooter was killed before he could continue his attack further. Unlike the El Paso shooting, the motives behind the Dayton attack are unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce again, the prospect of political action from the Republican government seemed limited in the wake of the shootings, as they tried to steer the rhetoric towards mental health and violent video games, instead of opening a debate about gun control. The special circumstances of the El Paso attack did lead President Donald Trump to make a statement opposing racism, though critics argued that this statement did not seem entirely convincing, given that the shooter\u0026rsquo;s rhetoric in his manifesto to some extent echoed Trump\u0026rsquo;s own aggressive rhetoric towards Hispanic immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Mass shootings and school shootings","MetaDescription":"A mass shooting refers to an incident involving multiple deaths caused by firearms.
