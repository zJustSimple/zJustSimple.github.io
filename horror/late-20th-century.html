An early writer of horror stories and stories with horror elements in this period was Shirley Jackson, who is particularly famous for the short story<strong> &ldquo;The Lottery&rdquo; </strong>(1948), which is not about supernatural monsters, but is rather focused on the horrors that ordinary human beings might commit against each other when influenced by tradition or authority figures. Jackson also went on to write more traditional gothic horror with <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> (1959), however.</p><p>In general, there was a growing trend towards more realistic horror stories, which would often focus on <strong>human villains such as serial killers or other violent criminals</strong>. A famous example of this trend was <strong><em>Psycho</em></strong> (1959) by Robert Bloch, which tells the story of a psychologically complex but relentlessly violent killer. Shortly after its publication, the novel was adapted into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock, and became even more famous in this format.</p><p>The rising fascination with serial killers among the American public has sometimes been attributed to the case of <strong>Ed Gein</strong>, a real-life murderer and grave robber <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ed-Gein">who crafted furniture and clothing out of human bodies he had dug up from their graves</a>. Gein helped inspire both Robert Bloch&rsquo;s <em>Psycho</em>, and the later novels about the cannibalistic serial killer <strong>Dr. Hannibal Lecter</strong> (1981-2006) by Thomas Harris.</p><p>In 1974 a young <strong>Stephen King</strong> published <em>Carrie</em>, his debut novel. This tale of a girl with strange powers who take horrible revenge on her bullies would launch King straight into literary fame - and start off an extremely productive literary career which today includess more than 50 novels and more than 200 short stories - most of them falling somewhere within the horror genre. <a target="" href="late-20th-century/stephen-king.html">You can read much more about Stephen King here</a>.</p><p><strong>Anne Rice</strong> is another noteworthy author of this period. Her <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> (1976) is notable for casting vampires as its main characters, and for its focus on the psychological and ethical implications of being an immortal creature who is forced to feed on the blood of living beings to survive. The current trend of portraying vampires as tragic anti-heroes rather than simple villains (such as in the <em>Twilight</em> series) can partly be traced back to Rice&rsquo;s ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The 1990s saw <strong>a rise in horror stories marketed to children and young adults</strong>, most famously through the wildly successful <strong><em>Goosebumps </em></strong>series (1992-1997) by R.L. Stine, which is the second-best selling book series in history (only surpassed by <em>Harry Potter</em>). The <em>Goosebumps</em> books typically focus on children who are exposed to classic elements of the horror genre such as ghosts, monsters and demons - but because of the books&rsquo; young audience, they rarely involve direct violence and death.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="f9e493f2-51e8-4f0b-a94f-3e3b25d68463"><a name="_owaxr763y3kn"></a>Horror movies in the late 20th century</h2><p>Around the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) was one of the most influential horror directors, even earning a nickname as the &ldquo;Master of Suspense&rdquo;. Some of his most famous horror or suspense movies are <em>Rear Window</em> (1954), <em>Psycho</em> (1960) and <em>The Birds</em> (1963). Hitchcock was particularly famous for his use of a cinematic technique where a moving camera represents a human observer&rsquo;s perspective. This immersive technique was the basis of many suspenseful scenes, and is still widely used in horror movies today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Stanley Kubrick was one of the most influential directors of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. His most direct entry into the horror genre is <em>The Shining</em> (1980), an adaptation of <a target="" href="late-20th-century/stephen-king.html">Stephen King</a>&rsquo;s novel of the same name. Even though it received mixed reviews at the time of release, it is considered one of the greatest horror movies in history today, and many of its iconic scenes are frequently referenced in both popular culture and later horror movies.</p><p>Some of Kubrick&rsquo;s work in other genres also contains strong horror aspects &ndash; for example, many sections of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (1968) and <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> (1971) combine science fiction and horror. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Two new subgenres of horror movies became popular in the latter half of the 20th century - <strong>slasher films</strong> and <strong>splatter films</strong>. Towards the end of the century, the <strong>found footage</strong> genre also started to emerge and gain popularity.</p><h3 id="heading-3"><a name="_1m3m35lbnba9"></a>Slasher films</h3><p>Slasher films tend to focus on a group of people - often teenagers - who are stalked by a serial killer. The killer often murders his victims using some kind of bladed weapon or claw (that is why they are called &lsquo;slasher&rsquo;). The killer typically kills off his victims one by one, in various horrifying ways. In many cases only a single person manages to survive his attacks - and this person (typically a teenage girl) eventually ends up defeating the killer. The ending of the movie will often imply (or directly reveal!) that the killer is not truly defeated, however.</p><p>There are often strong <strong>sexual overtones</strong> to the plot in slasher films. The protagonists are often teenagers who are starting to become sexually active, and the killer&rsquo;s gruesome murders often directly follow sexual acts, implying that the characters are somehow getting punished for their &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. Also, the only person who survives the killer&rsquo;s attacks - and finally defeats him - is frequently the one virgin girl in the cast of main characters.</p><p>Famous early slasher films are <em>Halloween</em> (1978) and <em>Friday the 13th</em> (1980) - both of which have spawned a large number of sequels and remakes. Interest in the genre was also renewed in the middle of the 1990s, when the first <em>Scream</em> movie (1996) was released.</p><h3 id="heading-4"><a name="_o17xo5b0cmci"></a>Splatter films</h3><p>Unlike slasher films, splatter films are not defined by any specific plot, but are simply characterised by <strong>extreme levels of on-screen blood and gore</strong>, often showing scenes of violence, mutilation and torture in gruesome detail using nauseating special effects.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first iconic movie makers in this genre was Herschell Gordon Lewis, whose <em>Blood Feast </em>(1963) is considered one of the first true splatter films - even though some splatter elements had also been seen in previous works.</p><p>The growing popularity of splatters in the 1970s created some <strong>backlash</strong>, as many felt this new genre was disgusting and even potentially harmful - some sought to have the movies banned, or at least wanted to impose strict age rating for viewing them. It did not help that many of the famous splatters also featured nudity and explicit sexual content, inviting further calls for censorship.</p><p>Later splatter films sometimes included gore that was so over-the-top that the special effects became more comedic than horrifying - this was the case with some of Peter Jackson&rsquo;s early movies, for example.</p><h3 id="heading-5"><a name="_tbi15dd8oxd6"></a>Found footage</h3><p>Found footage movies are designed to seem more realistic than other horror movies, because they are made to <strong>resemble video footage of real life events</strong> that someone happened to come across. They often take the form of a kind of fictional documentary, with the main characters setting out to investigate some sort of horror phenomenon - usually with deadly results.</p><p>These movies tend to be filmed with low-quality <strong>handheld cameras</strong>, and often use relatively low-budget effects to create a horror atmosphere. An early example of this style is <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em> (1980), the story of a film crew making a documentary about indigenous people in the Amazon. The movie only partially consists of video presented as &lsquo;found footage&rsquo;, but still helped call attention to the technique. Note that <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em> is <em>also</em> considered a splatter film (see above) because of extremely graphic scenes of murder and torture.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most famous examples of pure found footage is <strong><em>The Blair Witch Project</em> </strong>(1999), which focuses on a trio of amateur movie makers who travel into the woods to investigate an American urban legend. Despite its low budget and simplistic effects, the film became a major success and had a huge influence on later horror movies (such as the <em>Paranormal Activity</em> franchise).</p><p>Often the <strong>marketing campaigns</strong> of found footage movies directly try to present the idea that the movies depicts real events, to enhance the sense of realism. For example, <em>Blair Witch Project</em> marketing included realistic-looking missing person posters of the main actors in the film, while <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em> involved a contract that required the involved actors to keep a low media profile for a year after the movie was released, to imply that they might actually have died while creating the footage (this strategy worked so well that the director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/15/cannibal-holocaust">was put on trial for murder and had to get in touch with the actors to prove his innocence</a>).</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="d4e6491b-c24f-4fdf-a221-1e8217623383"><a name="_rhjahf8kx3l"></a>The first horror video games</h2><p>In the 1980s, the horror genre started to expand into a new medium - video games. The first horror games were graphically primitive by today&rsquo;s standards, but still shocked audiences at the time. The interactive aspect of these games often serves to increase the level of horror, as players come to identify closely with their on-screen avatars and therefore feel the horrors with a different level of intensity.</p><p>In 1992, <em>Alone in the Dark</em> was released to widespread success. This game asked players to navigate their characters through a haunted mansion with few resources available, and included plenty of frightening effects along the way. The success of the game helped pave the way for <em>Resident Evil</em> (1996), which pioneered the <strong>survival horror</strong> genre of games.</p><p>Survival horror games involve players navigating environments full of monsters or other terrors, while also being forced to overcome obstacles with very limited resources. They differ from regular action games in the way that the player will often have to evade or escape from threats rather than simply shooting them.</p><p>The 1990s also saw the release of a number of <strong>horror adventure games</strong>, which would often include live-action footage and therefore almost feel like interactive horror movies. A famous example of this style is <em>Phantasmagoria</em> (1995), which became extremely popular, but also received criticism for its graphic violence.

An early writer of horror stories and stories with horror elements in this period was Shirley Jackson, who is particularly famous for the short story\u003cstrong\u003e \u0026ldquo;The Lottery\u0026rdquo; \u003c/strong\u003e(1948), which is not about supernatural monsters, but is rather focused on the horrors that ordinary human beings might commit against each other when influenced by tradition or authority figures. Jackson also went on to write more traditional gothic horror with \u003cem\u003eThe Haunting of Hill House\u003c/em\u003e (1959), however.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, there was a growing trend towards more realistic horror stories, which would often focus on \u003cstrong\u003ehuman villains such as serial killers or other violent criminals\u003c/strong\u003e. A famous example of this trend was \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePsycho\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (1959) by Robert Bloch, which tells the story of a psychologically complex but relentlessly violent killer. Shortly after its publication, the novel was adapted into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock, and became even more famous in this format.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rising fascination with serial killers among the American public has sometimes been attributed to the case of \u003cstrong\u003eEd Gein\u003c/strong\u003e, a real-life murderer and grave robber \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ed-Gein\u0022\u003ewho crafted furniture and clothing out of human bodies he had dug up from their graves\u003c/a\u003e. Gein helped inspire both Robert Bloch\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003ePsycho\u003c/em\u003e, and the later novels about the cannibalistic serial killer \u003cstrong\u003eDr. Hannibal Lecter\u003c/strong\u003e (1981-2006) by Thomas Harris.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1974 a young \u003cstrong\u003eStephen King\u003c/strong\u003e published \u003cem\u003eCarrie\u003c/em\u003e, his debut novel. This tale of a girl with strange powers who take horrible revenge on her bullies would launch King straight into literary fame - and start off an extremely productive literary career which today includess more than 50 novels and more than 200 short stories - most of them falling somewhere within the horror genre. \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/horror/late-20th-century/stephen-king\u0022\u003eYou can read much more about Stephen King here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Rice\u003c/strong\u003e is another noteworthy author of this period. Her \u003cem\u003eInterview with the Vampire\u003c/em\u003e (1976) is notable for casting vampires as its main characters, and for its focus on the psychological and ethical implications of being an immortal creature who is forced to feed on the blood of living beings to survive. The current trend of portraying vampires as tragic anti-heroes rather than simple villains (such as in the \u003cem\u003eTwilight\u003c/em\u003e series) can partly be traced back to Rice\u0026rsquo;s ideas.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 1990s saw \u003cstrong\u003ea rise in horror stories marketed to children and young adults\u003c/strong\u003e, most famously through the wildly successful \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoosebumps \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eseries (1992-1997) by R.L. Stine, which is the second-best selling book series in history (only surpassed by \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e). The \u003cem\u003eGoosebumps\u003c/em\u003e books typically focus on children who are exposed to classic elements of the horror genre such as ghosts, monsters and demons - but because of the books\u0026rsquo; young audience, they rarely involve direct violence and death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f9e493f2-51e8-4f0b-a94f-3e3b25d68463\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_owaxr763y3kn\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHorror movies in the late 20th century\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround the middle of the 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century, Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) was one of the most influential horror directors, even earning a nickname as the \u0026ldquo;Master of Suspense\u0026rdquo;. Some of his most famous horror or suspense movies are \u003cem\u003eRear Window\u003c/em\u003e (1954), \u003cem\u003ePsycho\u003c/em\u003e (1960) and \u003cem\u003eThe Birds\u003c/em\u003e (1963). Hitchcock was particularly famous for his use of a cinematic technique where a moving camera represents a human observer\u0026rsquo;s perspective. This immersive technique was the basis of many suspenseful scenes, and is still widely used in horror movies today. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStanley Kubrick was one of the most influential directors of the 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century. His most direct entry into the horror genre is \u003cem\u003eThe Shining\u003c/em\u003e (1980), an adaptation of \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/horror/late-20th-century/stephen-king\u0022\u003eStephen King\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s novel of the same name. Even though it received mixed reviews at the time of release, it is considered one of the greatest horror movies in history today, and many of its iconic scenes are frequently referenced in both popular culture and later horror movies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of Kubrick\u0026rsquo;s work in other genres also contains strong horror aspects \u0026ndash; for example, many sections of \u003cem\u003e2001: A Space Odyssey\u003c/em\u003e (1968) and \u003cem\u003eA Clockwork Orange\u003c/em\u003e (1971) combine science fiction and horror. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo new subgenres of horror movies became popular in the latter half of the 20th century - \u003cstrong\u003eslasher films\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003esplatter films\u003c/strong\u003e. Towards the end of the century, the \u003cstrong\u003efound footage\u003c/strong\u003e genre also started to emerge and gain popularity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_1m3m35lbnba9\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSlasher films\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlasher films tend to focus on a group of people - often teenagers - who are stalked by a serial killer. The killer often murders his victims using some kind of bladed weapon or claw (that is why they are called \u0026lsquo;slasher\u0026rsquo;). The killer typically kills off his victims one by one, in various horrifying ways. In many cases only a single person manages to survive his attacks - and this person (typically a teenage girl) eventually ends up defeating the killer. The ending of the movie will often imply (or directly reveal!) that the killer is not truly defeated, however.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are often strong \u003cstrong\u003esexual overtones\u003c/strong\u003e to the plot in slasher films. The protagonists are often teenagers who are starting to become sexually active, and the killer\u0026rsquo;s gruesome murders often directly follow sexual acts, implying that the characters are somehow getting punished for their \u0026lsquo;sins\u0026rsquo;. Also, the only person who survives the killer\u0026rsquo;s attacks - and finally defeats him - is frequently the one virgin girl in the cast of main characters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFamous early slasher films are \u003cem\u003eHalloween\u003c/em\u003e (1978) and \u003cem\u003eFriday the 13th\u003c/em\u003e (1980) - both of which have spawned a large number of sequels and remakes. Interest in the genre was also renewed in the middle of the 1990s, when the first \u003cem\u003eScream\u003c/em\u003e movie (1996) was released.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_o17xo5b0cmci\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSplatter films\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike slasher films, splatter films are not defined by any specific plot, but are simply characterised by \u003cstrong\u003eextreme levels of on-screen blood and gore\u003c/strong\u003e, often showing scenes of violence, mutilation and torture in gruesome detail using nauseating special effects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first iconic movie makers in this genre was Herschell Gordon Lewis, whose \u003cem\u003eBlood Feast \u003c/em\u003e(1963) is considered one of the first true splatter films - even though some splatter elements had also been seen in previous works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe growing popularity of splatters in the 1970s created some \u003cstrong\u003ebacklash\u003c/strong\u003e, as many felt this new genre was disgusting and even potentially harmful - some sought to have the movies banned, or at least wanted to impose strict age rating for viewing them. It did not help that many of the famous splatters also featured nudity and explicit sexual content, inviting further calls for censorship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater splatter films sometimes included gore that was so over-the-top that the special effects became more comedic than horrifying - this was the case with some of Peter Jackson\u0026rsquo;s early movies, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_tbi15dd8oxd6\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFound footage\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFound footage movies are designed to seem more realistic than other horror movies, because they are made to \u003cstrong\u003eresemble video footage of real life events\u003c/strong\u003e that someone happened to come across. They often take the form of a kind of fictional documentary, with the main characters setting out to investigate some sort of horror phenomenon - usually with deadly results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese movies tend to be filmed with low-quality \u003cstrong\u003ehandheld cameras\u003c/strong\u003e, and often use relatively low-budget effects to create a horror atmosphere. An early example of this style is \u003cem\u003eCannibal Holocaust\u003c/em\u003e (1980), the story of a film crew making a documentary about indigenous people in the Amazon. The movie only partially consists of video presented as \u0026lsquo;found footage\u0026rsquo;, but still helped call attention to the technique. Note that \u003cem\u003eCannibal Holocaust\u003c/em\u003e is \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e considered a splatter film (see above) because of extremely graphic scenes of murder and torture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most famous examples of pure found footage is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Blair Witch Project\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e(1999), which focuses on a trio of amateur movie makers who travel into the woods to investigate an American urban legend. Despite its low budget and simplistic effects, the film became a major success and had a huge influence on later horror movies (such as the \u003cem\u003eParanormal Activity\u003c/em\u003e franchise).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOften the \u003cstrong\u003emarketing campaigns\u003c/strong\u003e of found footage movies directly try to present the idea that the movies depicts real events, to enhance the sense of realism. For example, \u003cem\u003eBlair Witch Project\u003c/em\u003e marketing included realistic-looking missing person posters of the main actors in the film, while \u003cem\u003eCannibal Holocaust\u003c/em\u003e involved a contract that required the involved actors to keep a low media profile for a year after the movie was released, to imply that they might actually have died while creating the footage (this strategy worked so well that the director \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/15/cannibal-holocaust\u0022\u003ewas put on trial for murder and had to get in touch with the actors to prove his innocence\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d4e6491b-c24f-4fdf-a221-1e8217623383\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_rhjahf8kx3l\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe first horror video games\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 1980s, the horror genre started to expand into a new medium - video games. The first horror games were graphically primitive by today\u0026rsquo;s standards, but still shocked audiences at the time. The interactive aspect of these games often serves to increase the level of horror, as players come to identify closely with their on-screen avatars and therefore feel the horrors with a different level of intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1992, \u003cem\u003eAlone in the Dark\u003c/em\u003e was released to widespread success. This game asked players to navigate their characters through a haunted mansion with few resources available, and included plenty of frightening effects along the way. The success of the game helped pave the way for \u003cem\u003eResident Evil\u003c/em\u003e (1996), which pioneered the \u003cstrong\u003esurvival horror\u003c/strong\u003e genre of games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSurvival horror games involve players navigating environments full of monsters or other terrors, while also being forced to overcome obstacles with very limited resources. They differ from regular action games in the way that the player will often have to evade or escape from threats rather than simply shooting them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 1990s also saw the release of a number of \u003cstrong\u003ehorror adventure games\u003c/strong\u003e, which would often include live-action footage and therefore almost feel like interactive horror movies. A famous example of this style is \u003cem\u003ePhantasmagoria\u003c/em\u003e (1995), which became extremely popular, but also received criticism for its graphic violence. The controversial inclusion of a rape scene further meant that some stores refused to sell the game, many consumers called for a boycott, and it was even completely blocked from the Australian market for a long time.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Horror in the late 20th century","MetaDescription":"Towards the second half of the 20th century, the horror genre began to move in many different directions and was taken up by a large number of new writers.
