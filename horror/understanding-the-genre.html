It is easy to explain the appeal of the comedy genre, for example, as laughter is a pleasant experience, but why do people seek out something that causes terror and disgust?</p><h2 data-guid="eb3f7535-62ca-42a3-82c9-2a00ba0c8b2c" id="heading-2"><a name="_wntvpsmzzxc1"></a>Why is horror scary?</h2><p>One of the main questions people have asked when studying horror is what it is that makes it scary. Is it mainly the types of literary or visual devices used, or is it more closely related to the subject matter? Does it play on people&rsquo;s existing fears or phobias, or is it able to create terror of something that a person is not remotely afraid of in real life?</p><p>Many different theories about why horror is scary have been presented, but&nbsp;we will focus on two of the most popular ones in this section - the biological theory and the Freudian theory.&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_tm7a66msu44a"></a>The biological theory</h3><p>One of the most simple attempts to explain why horror is scary is to link it to biology. Human beings have evolved biologically from our earliest days when we had to survive in an often dangerous wilderness, and this still has an impact on our present-day lives. According to the biological theory, the reason horror movies scare us is that they remind us of threats that we regularly had to face while living in the wilderness. The fear of monsters in stories or on tv screens is thus linked to a rational fear of real threats - especially <strong>predatory animals</strong>.</p><p>This theory seems intuitively attractive, and when reflecting on many of the typical fictional or mythological monsters, it is also notable that many of them contain some animal elements (such as claws or fangs), and most of them are literally trying to eat the unlucky humans who have to escape from them. There is also some research backing the biological theory up. For example, <a target="" href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-11/lure-horror"><em>The Psychologist</em> cites a study</a> in which it is shown that even small children who have no real life experience with dangerous animals still respond very swiftly to images of snakes, suggesting that <strong>the fear of dangerous animals is deeply rooted in us</strong>.</p><p>The biological theory thus has a lot to recommend it, though it may have more trouble explaining <strong>the types of horror that cannot be directly traced back to any kind of biological fear</strong>. The fear of ghosts is more difficult to explain biologically, for example, as ghosts do not directly resemble dangerous animals, and in most stories they are not trying to eat people.</p><h3><a name="_mp7x846rzu2m"></a>The Freudian theory</h3><p>Though Freudian psychoanalysis has fallen out of favour within the academic field of psychology, many claim that it still provides a useful framework for explaining the attraction of various literary themes and genres.</p><p>Freudian psychoanalysis is based on the idea that the human personality contains three different elements - <strong>id</strong>, <strong>ego</strong> and <strong>superego</strong>. We are born with the id, but the other two are developed in separate stages of our childhood (unless something happens to impair this development).</p><p>The <strong>id</strong> represents our basic instincts, including sexual desire and fear of death, but has no capacity for logic. It is only concerned with fulfilling its desires and avoiding its fears, with no inhibitions whatsoever. The <strong>ego</strong> is the rational, decision-making part of our brain. It still works to satisfy the desires of the id, but is able to rationally plan how to achieve them. The <strong>superego</strong> contains the moral values that we learn from society. It includes an idea of what the ideal person is like, and can make the ego feel guilt and shame if it does not live up to this ideal. It helps us repress the more destructive desires of the id.</p><p>All of the id and elements of the ego and superego belong to the unconscious parts of our minds, meaning that we are often not directly aware of the reasons for our actions. The Freudian theory also suggests that many of our most basic fears and desires are <strong>repressed</strong> by ego and superego when we grow up to become normal adults.</p><p>It is these repressions which are key to understanding the effects of horror. According to the Freudian view, the scary elements of stories and movies do not scare us because of what they directly represent, but because of <strong>the repressed fears, desires and anxieties that they indirectly remind us of</strong>.</p><p>A Freudian understanding of horror also involves the concept of the &lsquo;<strong>uncanny</strong>&rsquo;, which refers to something which is simultaneously familiar and deeply strange. It might be representations of something we would normally consider completely safe and ordinary, but with one tiny detail out of place. This mix of familiar and unfamiliar can create a deep feeling of unease in viewers, especially when it involves human faces or bodies that are distorted in some ways.</p><h2 data-guid="acd4d6f2-aca5-4054-9a2b-f1729c46b098" id="heading-3"><a name="_26v7fggkddl6"></a>Why do people enjoy horror?</h2><p>The primary characteristic of the horror genre is that a piece of horror media aims to create specific <strong>emotions</strong> in its audience - notably feelings of fear, terror or disgust.</p><p>Since these are usually regarded as negative emotions - which people go to great lengths to <em>avoid</em> experiencing in real life - this raises some interesting questions about why the horror genre is so popular. <strong>Why do people voluntarily seek out something that has been carefully designed to frighten or disgust them?</strong></p><p>Over the years, people have attempted to explain the appeal of horror through various different strategies. Here, we will consider a few of the most popular suggestions. If you enjoy horror yourself, it might also be useful to reflect on what attracts <em>you</em> to the genre.</p><h3><a name="_p51d8rlmf1eu"></a>Horror as practice for real life</h3><p>One theory might be that horror is appealing because the genre provides a completely <strong>safe way to train for dangerous situations</strong> in real life - even though those dangerous situations might be unlikely to actually occur. Even horror dealing with completely unrealistic elements might still serve this purpose, as experiencing the hero running from a monster might in some ways help prepare for the hypothetical situation of having to run from a violent criminal - or other threat - in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>This explanation of the appeal of horror matches the evolutionary theory about the way horror works (see above). If horror is scary because it resembles real-life threats, then it also seems likely that horror might appeal because it provides a safe way of testing out how one might react to a real-life threatening situation.</p><h3><a name="_o0oetgcc1ff0"></a>Horror as catharsis</h3><p>Catharsis is a term that describes the <strong>psychological relief</strong> that a person may feel when they are allowed to bring repressed fears, desires and anxieties to the surface. According to this theory, horror is enjoyable because it can produce a feeling of catharsis in the reader or viewer. By directly experiencing fears or desires that might have been repressed for a long time, the horror audience feel a strong sense of relief after &lsquo;surviving&rsquo; the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of horror serving as catharsis is strongly linked to the Freudian theory about the way horror works (see above). Since repression of fears, desires and anxieties can lead to psychological stress and even stunt psychological development, seeking out safe ways to release these repressions and achieve catharsis may be a psychologically healthy thing to do.</p><h3><a name="_nkhtbnk0gc90"></a>Horror as an adrenaline rush</h3><p>Another, more basic theory is that horror is enjoyable for the same reason that roller-coaster rides or extreme sports are enjoyable. The experience of fear causes an <strong>adrenaline rush</strong>, as the brain is led to believe that it is in danger and reacts accordingly, releasing hormones which fills the body with energy and makes blood pump faster. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/why-do-some-brains-enjoy-fear/280938/">Recent research suggests that it is to some extent dependent on people&rsquo;s brain chemistry whether they find such adrenaline rushes enjoyable or unpleasant.</a>&nbsp;This helps explain why some people do not seem to enjoy the horror genre, and try to avoid it if possible - just as some people steer clear of extreme sports and other adrenaline-pumping activities.&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_pbhibaou02fa"></a>Horror as a social experience</h3><p>It has also been argued that horror is mainly enjoyable because of the social aspects of it. Watching a horror movie together can be <strong>a bonding experience</strong>, as it mimics the way that struggling through a difficult or dangerous situation might bring people together in real life.</p><p>However, this theory notably fails to explain why some people enjoy watching horror movies on their own - or even why some people enjoy horror <em>literature</em>, which is usually enjoyed in a less social context than horror movies.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="21st-century.html" title="Horror in the 21st century" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Horror in the 21st century</span></a><a href="texts.html" title="Index of horror stories and horror movies" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Index of horror stories</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

This might lead to careful analysis of the devices typically used in horror literature or horror movies, as well as an exploration of the types of themes that a majority of people tend to find scary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, it is also interesting to consider \u003cstrong\u003ewhy people enjoy the horror genre\u003c/strong\u003e, when it is focused on creating emotions that we normally think of as negative, and normally try to avoid. It is easy to explain the appeal of the comedy genre, for example, as laughter is a pleasant experience, but why do people seek out something that causes terror and disgust?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022eb3f7535-62ca-42a3-82c9-2a00ba0c8b2c\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_wntvpsmzzxc1\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWhy is horror scary?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the main questions people have asked when studying horror is what it is that makes it scary. Is it mainly the types of literary or visual devices used, or is it more closely related to the subject matter? Does it play on people\u0026rsquo;s existing fears or phobias, or is it able to create terror of something that a person is not remotely afraid of in real life?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany different theories about why horror is scary have been presented, but\u0026nbsp;we will focus on two of the most popular ones in this section - the biological theory and the Freudian theory.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_tm7a66msu44a\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe biological theory\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most simple attempts to explain why horror is scary is to link it to biology. Human beings have evolved biologically from our earliest days when we had to survive in an often dangerous wilderness, and this still has an impact on our present-day lives. According to the biological theory, the reason horror movies scare us is that they remind us of threats that we regularly had to face while living in the wilderness. The fear of monsters in stories or on tv screens is thus linked to a rational fear of real threats - especially \u003cstrong\u003epredatory animals\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis theory seems intuitively attractive, and when reflecting on many of the typical fictional or mythological monsters, it is also notable that many of them contain some animal elements (such as claws or fangs), and most of them are literally trying to eat the unlucky humans who have to escape from them. There is also some research backing the biological theory up. For example, \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-11/lure-horror\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Psychologist\u003c/em\u003e cites a study\u003c/a\u003e in which it is shown that even small children who have no real life experience with dangerous animals still respond very swiftly to images of snakes, suggesting that \u003cstrong\u003ethe fear of dangerous animals is deeply rooted in us\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biological theory thus has a lot to recommend it, though it may have more trouble explaining \u003cstrong\u003ethe types of horror that cannot be directly traced back to any kind of biological fear\u003c/strong\u003e. The fear of ghosts is more difficult to explain biologically, for example, as ghosts do not directly resemble dangerous animals, and in most stories they are not trying to eat people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_mp7x846rzu2m\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe Freudian theory\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough Freudian psychoanalysis has fallen out of favour within the academic field of psychology, many claim that it still provides a useful framework for explaining the attraction of various literary themes and genres.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFreudian psychoanalysis is based on the idea that the human personality contains three different elements - \u003cstrong\u003eid\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eego\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003esuperego\u003c/strong\u003e. We are born with the id, but the other two are developed in separate stages of our childhood (unless something happens to impair this development).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eid\u003c/strong\u003e represents our basic instincts, including sexual desire and fear of death, but has no capacity for logic. It is only concerned with fulfilling its desires and avoiding its fears, with no inhibitions whatsoever. The \u003cstrong\u003eego\u003c/strong\u003e is the rational, decision-making part of our brain. It still works to satisfy the desires of the id, but is able to rationally plan how to achieve them. The \u003cstrong\u003esuperego\u003c/strong\u003e contains the moral values that we learn from society. It includes an idea of what the ideal person is like, and can make the ego feel guilt and shame if it does not live up to this ideal. It helps us repress the more destructive desires of the id.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of the id and elements of the ego and superego belong to the unconscious parts of our minds, meaning that we are often not directly aware of the reasons for our actions. The Freudian theory also suggests that many of our most basic fears and desires are \u003cstrong\u003erepressed\u003c/strong\u003e by ego and superego when we grow up to become normal adults.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is these repressions which are key to understanding the effects of horror. According to the Freudian view, the scary elements of stories and movies do not scare us because of what they directly represent, but because of \u003cstrong\u003ethe repressed fears, desires and anxieties that they indirectly remind us of\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Freudian understanding of horror also involves the concept of the \u0026lsquo;\u003cstrong\u003euncanny\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026rsquo;, which refers to something which is simultaneously familiar and deeply strange. It might be representations of something we would normally consider completely safe and ordinary, but with one tiny detail out of place. This mix of familiar and unfamiliar can create a deep feeling of unease in viewers, especially when it involves human faces or bodies that are distorted in some ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022acd4d6f2-aca5-4054-9a2b-f1729c46b098\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_26v7fggkddl6\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWhy do people enjoy horror?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe primary characteristic of the horror genre is that a piece of horror media aims to create specific \u003cstrong\u003eemotions\u003c/strong\u003e in its audience - notably feelings of fear, terror or disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince these are usually regarded as negative emotions - which people go to great lengths to \u003cem\u003eavoid\u003c/em\u003e experiencing in real life - this raises some interesting questions about why the horror genre is so popular. \u003cstrong\u003eWhy do people voluntarily seek out something that has been carefully designed to frighten or disgust them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the years, people have attempted to explain the appeal of horror through various different strategies. Here, we will consider a few of the most popular suggestions. If you enjoy horror yourself, it might also be useful to reflect on what attracts \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e to the genre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_p51d8rlmf1eu\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHorror as practice for real life\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne theory might be that horror is appealing because the genre provides a completely \u003cstrong\u003esafe way to train for dangerous situations\u003c/strong\u003e in real life - even though those dangerous situations might be unlikely to actually occur. Even horror dealing with completely unrealistic elements might still serve this purpose, as experiencing the hero running from a monster might in some ways help prepare for the hypothetical situation of having to run from a violent criminal - or other threat - in real life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis explanation of the appeal of horror matches the evolutionary theory about the way horror works (see above). If horror is scary because it resembles real-life threats, then it also seems likely that horror might appeal because it provides a safe way of testing out how one might react to a real-life threatening situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_o0oetgcc1ff0\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHorror as catharsis\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCatharsis is a term that describes the \u003cstrong\u003epsychological relief\u003c/strong\u003e that a person may feel when they are allowed to bring repressed fears, desires and anxieties to the surface. According to this theory, horror is enjoyable because it can produce a feeling of catharsis in the reader or viewer. By directly experiencing fears or desires that might have been repressed for a long time, the horror audience feel a strong sense of relief after \u0026lsquo;surviving\u0026rsquo; the experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea of horror serving as catharsis is strongly linked to the Freudian theory about the way horror works (see above). Since repression of fears, desires and anxieties can lead to psychological stress and even stunt psychological development, seeking out safe ways to release these repressions and achieve catharsis may be a psychologically healthy thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_nkhtbnk0gc90\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHorror as an adrenaline rush\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother, more basic theory is that horror is enjoyable for the same reason that roller-coaster rides or extreme sports are enjoyable. The experience of fear causes an \u003cstrong\u003eadrenaline rush\u003c/strong\u003e, as the brain is led to believe that it is in danger and reacts accordingly, releasing hormones which fills the body with energy and makes blood pump faster. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/why-do-some-brains-enjoy-fear/280938/\u0022\u003eRecent research suggests that it is to some extent dependent on people\u0026rsquo;s brain chemistry whether they find such adrenaline rushes enjoyable or unpleasant.\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;This helps explain why some people do not seem to enjoy the horror genre, and try to avoid it if possible - just as some people steer clear of extreme sports and other adrenaline-pumping activities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_pbhibaou02fa\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHorror as a social experience\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has also been argued that horror is mainly enjoyable because of the social aspects of it. Watching a horror movie together can be \u003cstrong\u003ea bonding experience\u003c/strong\u003e, as it mimics the way that struggling through a difficult or dangerous situation might bring people together in real life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, this theory notably fails to explain why some people enjoy watching horror movies on their own - or even why some people enjoy horror \u003cem\u003eliterature\u003c/em\u003e, which is usually enjoyed in a less social context than horror movies.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Understanding horror","MetaDescription":"When working with the horror genre, there are two main questions that one might wish to examine.
