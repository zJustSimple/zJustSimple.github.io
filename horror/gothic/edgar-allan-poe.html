He was born in Boston, but his father left the family when Poe was still a baby, and his mother died soon afterwards, making him <strong>an orphan very early in life</strong>.</p><p>Young Poe was instead raised by John and Frances Allan, which was how he got his middle name. Edgar had a number of conflicts with John while growing up, usually in relation to the subject of money.</p><p>Poe had a brief career in the US Army, but after failing to become an officer, he instead focused his attention on <strong>poetry and literature</strong>. He worked as a literary critic for various literary journals, gaining a reputation for vicious criticism, but in between he also published his own work, and slowly gained more recognition - particularly when he published the gothic poem &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo; (<span style="color:rgb(26,36,46);">&bdquo;</span><a href="https://liceunet.ro/rezumat/corbul-interpretarea-versurilor"><span style="color:rgb(26,36,46);">Corbul</span></a><span style="color:rgb(26,36,46);">&rdquo;)</span> in 1845.</p><p>In 1836 Poe <strong>married his 13-year-old cousin</strong>, Virginia Clemm, though she died of tuberculosis just 11 years later, in 1847. Her illness and death are thought to have inspired some of his later works; especially &ldquo;Annabel Lee&rdquo; (1849), which is focused on the untimely death of a young woman and the speaker&rsquo;s efforts to cope with his loss.</p><p>Poe himself <strong>died of unknown causes</strong> just two years after his wife, when he was only 40 years old. He was discovered in the streets one morning in great distress and speaking incoherently, and was taken to a hospital. He died shortly afterwards, but all medical records of the case have been lost, so it is unclear how he died.</p><p>Though Poe managed to gain recognition as <strong>a critic, poet and author</strong> during his lifetime, his work never made him wealthy. He also struggled with alcoholism for much of his life, which may have contributed to his early death.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="1f84a9c9-0b8a-451c-bf14-3b0c0617c8b7">Literary career</h2><p>Most of Poe&rsquo;s work falls into the <strong>gothic horror</strong> genre. His stories are often focused on protagonists who descend into <strong>madness</strong>, and it can be hard to tell which elements of his tales are meant to be real, and which are meant to be produced from the protagonist&rsquo;s imagination. The <strong>unreliable narrator</strong> is therefore also a frequently used literary device in his works - a famous example being the main character of &ldquo;The Tell-Tale Heart&rdquo; (1843), who strongly denies that he is mad, but shows clear signs of madness.</p><p>Apart from madness, typical themes in Poe&rsquo;s horror stories are <strong>death</strong>, <strong>loss</strong> and <strong>despair</strong>. His stories are often centred on an unnamed first-person narrator who somehow comes face to face with death or loss - or who end up committing horrible crimes. There is often a moral element to Poe&rsquo;s tales as well - in both &ldquo;<a href="../../inima-care-si-spune-taina/summary.html">The Tell-Tale Heart</a>&rdquo; (1843) and &ldquo;<a href="../../edgar-allan-poe/pisica-neagra.html">The Black Cat</a>&rdquo; (1843), the murderer is finally driven to confess his crimes because of his overpowering feeling of guilt.&nbsp;</p><p>Poe also wrote other genres, however. For example, many consider him the father of modern <strong>detective stories</strong> because of his short stories about the brilliant detective Auguste Dupin (which would later inspire Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to invent the legendary Sherlock Holmes character), and he also wrote some tales in the comedy genre. Finally, Poe also wrote a single full-length novel; the surreal sea adventure <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i> (1838) (<a href="https://liceunet.ro/documente/aventurile-lui-arthur-gordon-pym-rezumat">rezumat în limba română</a>).</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="60b7b852-a431-4445-9342-e26c5f634b56">Legacy</h2><p>Shortly after Poe&rsquo;s death, a literary rival named Rufus Griswold produced an extremely negative article about him, trying to depict him as drug addict, drunkard and madman - and he included some of Poe&rsquo;s personal letters as evidence for his claims. It later turned out that many of these letters were false, and that most of Griswold&rsquo;s claims were either lies or exaggerations. Nevertheless, the idea of Poe being a horrible, insane person continued to be popular among the public, perhaps because it added an extra layer of dark mystery to reading his gothic stories.</p><p>Today Poe is considered <strong>one of the greatest writers of American literature</strong>, particularly admired for his influence on gothic horror and detective fiction. He has also been credited for laying the foundations of the <strong>psychological horror</strong> genre, given his frequent use of madness as a literary theme. His influence has even gone beyond the field of literature, as his mystery story &ldquo;The Gold-Bug&rdquo; (&ldquo;<a href="../../edgar-allan-poe/carabusul-de-aur.html">Cărăbușul de aur</a>&rdquo;) inspired much public interest in the field of <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Cryptography is the science of creating and deciphering coded messages. It was a highly relevant field in the World Wars and during the Cold War, and it is also hugely important in the digital age.&amp;nbsp;</p>">cryptography</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Poe&rsquo;s works are still widely read today, and have been adapted in various formats, and referenced countless times in popular culture. Even in the most modern horror franchises, the influence of Poe can be felt. The terrible death traps of the popular <i>Saw</i> movies (2004-2017) owe a lot to Poe&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;The Pit and the Pendulum&rdquo; (1842), for example (the directors even called attention to this influence by directly including the pendulum trap from Poe&rsquo;s story in <i>Saw V</i>).</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="8bd6cae3-a3f8-4625-838d-dbe4ff9d1684">Short stories and poems</h2><p>The narrator of <strong>"The Black Cat"</strong>&nbsp;initially leads a happy life, being fond of both his wife and his pet cat. However, his growing alcohol problem soon causes things to spiral out of control, as he ends up torturing and killing the cat in fits of drunken rage - and it only gets worse from there. This story is a good example of the psychological horror that Poe&rsquo;s works often contain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>"The&nbsp;Cask of Amontillado"</strong> is entirely set in a wine cellar, where a nobleman is leading a friend on an expedition to find a cask of especially fine wine. However, the nobleman&rsquo;s true agenda is to take horrible vengeance against his &lsquo;friend&rsquo; for a previous insult. This story is particularly notable for its heavy use of foreshadowing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>"The Masque of the Red Death"</strong>&nbsp;is centered around a decadent party being thrown in a nobleman&rsquo;s gothic castle in the time of a horrible plague. The party-goers dance and celebrate in a series of uniquely decorated rooms in different colours - though the last room is dark and ominous. As a mysterious masked stranger enters the crowd, the guests grow frightened - and when the mask falls, it is revealed that the dreaded plague has entered their halls, and everybody dies.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker may be the most famous gothic novel, but Poe's <strong>&ldquo;The Raven&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://liceunet.ro/documente/corbul-edgar-allan-poe-rezumat-interpretarea-versurilor">rezumat în limba română</a>) is a strong candidate for the most famous gothic poem. The speaker is alone in an empty house, trying to cope with the loss of his beloved Lenore, when a mysterious raven enters his home and repeats the famous phrase &ldquo;Nevermore&rdquo;, pushing the speaker further and further towards madness and despair.&nbsp;</p><p>One of Poe&rsquo;s most famous stories. <strong>&ldquo;The Tell-Tale Heart&rdquo;</strong> begins with an unnamed narrator describing his plans to murder an old man because he cannot stand looking at his deformed eye. The plan succeeds, and the narrator disposes of the corpse by hiding it beneath the floorboards. Feeling confident he will not be discovered, he invites the police officers to investigate the house. They suspect nothing, but when the narrator starts hearing the persistent sound of a heartbeat from where the corpse is hidden, he breaks down and gives himself up.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../gothic.html" title="Gothic horror" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Gothic horror</span></a><a href="../early-20th-century.html" title="Horror in the early 20th century" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Horror in the early 20th century</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

He was born in Boston, but his father left the family when Poe was still a baby, and his mother died soon afterwards, making him \u003cstrong\u003ean orphan very early in life\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYoung Poe was instead raised by John and Frances Allan, which was how he got his middle name. Edgar had a number of conflicts with John while growing up, usually in relation to the subject of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoe had a brief career in the US Army, but after failing to become an officer, he instead focused his attention on \u003cstrong\u003epoetry and literature\u003c/strong\u003e. He worked as a literary critic for various literary journals, gaining a reputation for vicious criticism, but in between he also published his own work, and slowly gained more recognition - particularly when he published the gothic poem \u0026ldquo;The Raven\u0026rdquo; (\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(26,36,46);\u0022\u003e\u0026bdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/rezumat/corbul-interpretarea-versurilor\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(26,36,46);\u0022\u003eCorbul\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(26,36,46);\u0022\u003e\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/span\u003e in 1845.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1836 Poe \u003cstrong\u003emarried his 13-year-old cousin\u003c/strong\u003e, Virginia Clemm, though she died of tuberculosis just 11 years later, in 1847. Her illness and death are thought to have inspired some of his later works; especially \u0026ldquo;Annabel Lee\u0026rdquo; (1849), which is focused on the untimely death of a young woman and the speaker\u0026rsquo;s efforts to cope with his loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoe himself \u003cstrong\u003edied of unknown causes\u003c/strong\u003e just two years after his wife, when he was only 40 years old. He was discovered in the streets one morning in great distress and speaking incoherently, and was taken to a hospital. He died shortly afterwards, but all medical records of the case have been lost, so it is unclear how he died.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough Poe managed to gain recognition as \u003cstrong\u003ea critic, poet and author\u003c/strong\u003e during his lifetime, his work never made him wealthy. He also struggled with alcoholism for much of his life, which may have contributed to his early death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00221f84a9c9-0b8a-451c-bf14-3b0c0617c8b7\u0022\u003eLiterary career\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of Poe\u0026rsquo;s work falls into the \u003cstrong\u003egothic horror\u003c/strong\u003e genre. His stories are often focused on protagonists who descend into \u003cstrong\u003emadness\u003c/strong\u003e, and it can be hard to tell which elements of his tales are meant to be real, and which are meant to be produced from the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s imagination. The \u003cstrong\u003eunreliable narrator\u003c/strong\u003e is therefore also a frequently used literary device in his works - a famous example being the main character of \u0026ldquo;The Tell-Tale Heart\u0026rdquo; (1843), who strongly denies that he is mad, but shows clear signs of madness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApart from madness, typical themes in Poe\u0026rsquo;s horror stories are \u003cstrong\u003edeath\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eloss\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003edespair\u003c/strong\u003e. His stories are often centred on an unnamed first-person narrator who somehow comes face to face with death or loss - or who end up committing horrible crimes. There is often a moral element to Poe\u0026rsquo;s tales as well - in both \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/inima-care-si-spune-taina/summary\u0022\u003eThe Tell-Tale Heart\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo; (1843) and \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/edgar-allan-poe/pisica-neagra\u0022\u003eThe Black Cat\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo; (1843), the murderer is finally driven to confess his crimes because of his overpowering feeling of guilt.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoe also wrote other genres, however. For example, many consider him the father of modern \u003cstrong\u003edetective stories\u003c/strong\u003e because of his short stories about the brilliant detective Auguste Dupin (which would later inspire Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to invent the legendary Sherlock Holmes character), and he also wrote some tales in the comedy genre. Finally, Poe also wrote a single full-length novel; the surreal sea adventure \u003ci\u003eThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\u003c/i\u003e (1838) (\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/documente/aventurile-lui-arthur-gordon-pym-rezumat\u0022\u003erezumat în limba română\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002260b7b852-a431-4445-9342-e26c5f634b56\u0022\u003eLegacy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after Poe\u0026rsquo;s death, a literary rival named Rufus Griswold produced an extremely negative article about him, trying to depict him as drug addict, drunkard and madman - and he included some of Poe\u0026rsquo;s personal letters as evidence for his claims. It later turned out that many of these letters were false, and that most of Griswold\u0026rsquo;s claims were either lies or exaggerations. Nevertheless, the idea of Poe being a horrible, insane person continued to be popular among the public, perhaps because it added an extra layer of dark mystery to reading his gothic stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday Poe is considered \u003cstrong\u003eone of the greatest writers of American literature\u003c/strong\u003e, particularly admired for his influence on gothic horror and detective fiction. He has also been credited for laying the foundations of the \u003cstrong\u003epsychological horror\u003c/strong\u003e genre, given his frequent use of madness as a literary theme. His influence has even gone beyond the field of literature, as his mystery story \u0026ldquo;The Gold-Bug\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/edgar-allan-poe/carabusul-de-aur\u0022\u003eCărăbușul de aur\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;) inspired much public interest in the field of \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eCryptography is the science of creating and deciphering coded messages.

Even in the most modern horror franchises, the influence of Poe can be felt. The terrible death traps of the popular \u003ci\u003eSaw\u003c/i\u003e movies (2004-2017) owe a lot to Poe\u0026rsquo;s short story \u0026ldquo;The Pit and the Pendulum\u0026rdquo; (1842), for example (the directors even called attention to this influence by directly including the pendulum trap from Poe\u0026rsquo;s story in \u003ci\u003eSaw V\u003c/i\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u00228bd6cae3-a3f8-4625-838d-dbe4ff9d1684\u0022\u003eShort stories and poems\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator of \u003cstrong\u003e\u0022The Black Cat\u0022\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;initially leads a happy life, being fond of both his wife and his pet cat. However, his growing alcohol problem soon causes things to spiral out of control, as he ends up torturing and killing the cat in fits of drunken rage - and it only gets worse from there. This story is a good example of the psychological horror that Poe\u0026rsquo;s works often contain.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0022The\u0026nbsp;Cask of Amontillado\u0022\u003c/strong\u003e is entirely set in a wine cellar, where a nobleman is leading a friend on an expedition to find a cask of especially fine wine. However, the nobleman\u0026rsquo;s true agenda is to take horrible vengeance against his \u0026lsquo;friend\u0026rsquo; for a previous insult. This story is particularly notable for its heavy use of foreshadowing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0022The Masque of the Red Death\u0022\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;is centered around a decadent party being thrown in a nobleman\u0026rsquo;s gothic castle in the time of a horrible plague. The party-goers dance and celebrate in a series of uniquely decorated rooms in different colours - though the last room is dark and ominous. As a mysterious masked stranger enters the crowd, the guests grow frightened - and when the mask falls, it is revealed that the dreaded plague has entered their halls, and everybody dies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDracula\u003c/i\u003e by Bram Stoker may be the most famous gothic novel, but Poe\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Raven\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;(\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/documente/corbul-edgar-allan-poe-rezumat-interpretarea-versurilor\u0022\u003erezumat în limba română\u003c/a\u003e) is a strong candidate for the most famous gothic poem. The speaker is alone in an empty house, trying to cope with the loss of his beloved Lenore, when a mysterious raven enters his home and repeats the famous phrase \u0026ldquo;Nevermore\u0026rdquo;, pushing the speaker further and further towards madness and despair.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of Poe\u0026rsquo;s most famous stories. \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Tell-Tale Heart\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e begins with an unnamed narrator describing his plans to murder an old man because he cannot stand looking at his deformed eye. The plan succeeds, and the narrator disposes of the corpse by hiding it beneath the floorboards. Feeling confident he will not be discovered, he invites the police officers to investigate the house. They suspect nothing, but when the narrator starts hearing the persistent sound of a heartbeat from where the corpse is hidden, he breaks down and gives himself up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Edgar Allan Poe","MetaDescription":"Edgar Allan Poe was born Edgar Poe in 1809.
