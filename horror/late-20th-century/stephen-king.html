His father left the family when King was just two years old, leaving them in great financial difficulties.</p><p>King has revealed that his interest in horror fiction started when he was just a child, upon reading some of H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s short stories. At school King started to write his own stories, and even contributed to some <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;An unofficial printed magazine created by fans of something&amp;nbsp;- either an entire genre (e.g. science fiction) or a specific franchise (e.g. Star Trek). Fanzines have historically been&amp;nbsp;especially common within niche genres such as science fiction, fantasy or horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, websites and online message boards&amp;nbsp;have increasingly replaced fanzines as the places&amp;nbsp;where fan communities interact.&lt;/p&gt;">fanzines</span> with his early tales.</p><p>King married Tabitha Spruce, who was also a writer, in 1971. The two of them struggled financially, as King was only able to sell a limited number of stories, earning just enough to scrape by. King also developed an alcohol problem at this point.</p><p>The family&rsquo;s financial struggles were mostly overcome thanks to the success of King&rsquo;s debut novel <em>Carrie</em> (1973), but King&rsquo;s drinking problems kept growing worse. Nevertheless, he continued to write novels and proceeded to produce many bestsellers.</p><p>King and his family moved around a lot in the following years, but eventually settled down in King&rsquo;s home state, Maine. At that point, King and Tabitha had three children together. King became a teacher of creative writing at the University of Maine in 1977, but continued his very active writing career as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1980s King had a serious drinking problem, combined with addiction to a number of other drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. His family eventually grew so frustrated and worried that they staged an <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;In this context, an intervention is a planned event where the friends and family of an addict&amp;nbsp;agree to get together and confront the addict directly, in an effort to inspire him or her to seek professional help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;">intervention</span> and directly confronted King with the scale of his problem. He sought help, and managed to quit both drugs and alcohol in the late 1980s.</p><p>In 1999 King was involved in a serious car accident, when he was hit by a van while on a walk. He suffered many painful injuries and his writing slowed down drastically for a time. At one point he announced that he would stop writing completely because of the pain he endured - but he later changed his mind, and is still a very active writer today.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="f41979f1-cc7c-4722-b581-3eeb1ed6f448"><a name="_ihwwpk8qs9g5"></a>Literary career</h2><p>King is a highly productive writer, known for producing stories at a rapid pace over a career spanning many years.</p><p>His first professional short story was &ldquo;The Glass Floor&rdquo; (1967), published in <em>Startling Mystery Stories</em>, and in the following years King would go on to publish more short stories in various magazines, though not enough to make a living.</p><p>King&rsquo;s breakthrough came with the release of his first novel <strong><em>Carrie</em> (1973)</strong>, a dark tale about a girl with strange powers who takes horrible vengeance against her community after a series of cruel bullying incidents. It was followed by a number of other successful horror novels, such as <em>Salem&rsquo;s Lot</em> (1975), <em>The Shining</em> (1977) and <em>The Stand</em> (1978).</p><p>Throughout his career King also experimented with writing under various other pseudonyms, in an attempt to learn whether he could still become a literary success if starting from scratch, instead of being carried by the established fame of his name. Beginning in 1977, he released a number of novels under the pseudonym <strong>Richard Bachman</strong>, for example, though critics eventually discovered that King was the true author behind these works.&nbsp;</p><p>King has also experimented with genres besides horror, such as his seven-volume fantasy series <em>The Dark Tower </em>(1982-2004), or his grim death row drama <em>The Green Mile </em>(1996). Though belonging to these different genres, even these atypical works by King tend to contain elements of horror (The nightmarish setting of <em>The Dark Tower</em> is full of terrible monsters, and <em>The Green Mile</em> contains very disturbing and graphic descriptions of executions and murder).</p><p>Many of King&rsquo;s works have been <strong>adapted into movies or tv shows</strong>, though only some of them successfully. Notably, Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>The Shining</em> (1980) is itself considered a genre classic in the field of horror movies. <em>The Shawshank Redemption </em>(1994), though not a horror story, is also one of the most well-received movies of all time, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top">having an enduring spot near or at the top of IMDB&rsquo;s popular index of top rated movies.</a> More recently, the 2017 adaptation of King&rsquo;s 1986 novel <em>It</em> was also a huge hit at the box office.</p><p>However, some adaptations are also widely regarded as flops, such as <em>The Lawnmower Man</em> (1992) or the more recent <em>The</em> <em>Dark Tower </em>(2017).&nbsp;</p><p>King is still a very active writer, having steadily produced one or two novels a year for the past couple of decades.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="ebadc0e5-25dc-4192-8559-285d392c16ba"><a name="_uyykm4nzrfdx"></a>Short stories</h2><p>In <strong>"The Man Who Loved Flowers"</strong>, a happy-looking young man is on his way to meet his beloved on a summer&rsquo;s day, buying flowers on the way. In the background we hear scattered news about some recent murders, but the atmosphere is otherwise bright and cheerful. However, as darkness falls the story takes a rapid dark turn as well, as it is revealed that the young man&rsquo;s intentions are not as pure and innocent as they seem.</p><p><strong>"The Boogeyman"</strong>&nbsp;is the story of a man in a psychologist&rsquo;s office, who tells the story of the deaths of his three children. The man keeps insisting that &lsquo;the Boogeyman&rsquo; has taken the children, while the rational psychologist tries to convince him that no such beings exist, and that the children have died of natural causes. After the therapy session has ended, the man discovers to his horror that the psychologist was really the Boogeyman in disguise.</p><p><strong>"Suffer the Little Children"</strong>&nbsp;is focused on a schoolteacher who gradually becomes convinced that the children in her class are actually demons in disguise. No one believes her theory, so she eventually takes matters into her own hands and starts killing them to protect the world. She is caught by the authorities and imprisoned, regarded as criminally insane - and she eventually kills herself. The story is particularly interesting because of its open ending - it is never directly revealed whether the teacher was right about the children being demons, or whether she was just a psychotic murderer.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../late-20th-century.html" title="Horror in the late 20th century" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Horror in the late 20th century</span></a><a href="../21st-century.html" title="Horror in the 21st century" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Horror in the 21st century</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The two of them struggled financially, as King was only able to sell a limited number of stories, earning just enough to scrape by. King also developed an alcohol problem at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe family\u0026rsquo;s financial struggles were mostly overcome thanks to the success of King\u0026rsquo;s debut novel \u003cem\u003eCarrie\u003c/em\u003e (1973), but King\u0026rsquo;s drinking problems kept growing worse. Nevertheless, he continued to write novels and proceeded to produce many bestsellers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKing and his family moved around a lot in the following years, but eventually settled down in King\u0026rsquo;s home state, Maine. At that point, King and Tabitha had three children together. King became a teacher of creative writing at the University of Maine in 1977, but continued his very active writing career as well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 1980s King had a serious drinking problem, combined with addiction to a number of other drugs such as cocaine and marijuana.

It was followed by a number of other successful horror novels, such as \u003cem\u003eSalem\u0026rsquo;s Lot\u003c/em\u003e (1975), \u003cem\u003eThe Shining\u003c/em\u003e (1977) and \u003cem\u003eThe Stand\u003c/em\u003e (1978).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout his career King also experimented with writing under various other pseudonyms, in an attempt to learn whether he could still become a literary success if starting from scratch, instead of being carried by the established fame of his name. Beginning in 1977, he released a number of novels under the pseudonym \u003cstrong\u003eRichard Bachman\u003c/strong\u003e, for example, though critics eventually discovered that King was the true author behind these works.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKing has also experimented with genres besides horror, such as his seven-volume fantasy series \u003cem\u003eThe Dark Tower \u003c/em\u003e(1982-2004), or his grim death row drama \u003cem\u003eThe Green Mile \u003c/em\u003e(1996). Though belonging to these different genres, even these atypical works by King tend to contain elements of horror (The nightmarish setting of \u003cem\u003eThe Dark Tower\u003c/em\u003e is full of terrible monsters, and \u003cem\u003eThe Green Mile\u003c/em\u003e contains very disturbing and graphic descriptions of executions and murder).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of King\u0026rsquo;s works have been \u003cstrong\u003eadapted into movies or tv shows\u003c/strong\u003e, though only some of them successfully. Notably, Stanley Kubrick\u0026rsquo;s adaptation of \u003cem\u003eThe Shining\u003c/em\u003e (1980) is itself considered a genre classic in the field of horror movies. \u003cem\u003eThe Shawshank Redemption \u003c/em\u003e(1994), though not a horror story, is also one of the most well-received movies of all time, \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.imdb.com/chart/top\u0022\u003ehaving an enduring spot near or at the top of IMDB\u0026rsquo;s popular index of top rated movies.\u003c/a\u003e More recently, the 2017 adaptation of King\u0026rsquo;s 1986 novel \u003cem\u003eIt\u003c/em\u003e was also a huge hit at the box office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, some adaptations are also widely regarded as flops, such as \u003cem\u003eThe Lawnmower Man\u003c/em\u003e (1992) or the more recent \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eDark Tower \u003c/em\u003e(2017).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKing is still a very active writer, having steadily produced one or two novels a year for the past couple of decades.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ebadc0e5-25dc-4192-8559-285d392c16ba\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_uyykm4nzrfdx\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eShort stories\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cstrong\u003e\u0022The Man Who Loved Flowers\u0022\u003c/strong\u003e, a happy-looking young man is on his way to meet his beloved on a summer\u0026rsquo;s day, buying flowers on the way. In the background we hear scattered news about some recent murders, but the atmosphere is otherwise bright and cheerful. However, as darkness falls the story takes a rapid dark turn as well, as it is revealed that the young man\u0026rsquo;s intentions are not as pure and innocent as they seem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0022The Boogeyman\u0022\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;is the story of a man in a psychologist\u0026rsquo;s office, who tells the story of the deaths of his three children.
