These include Nick Carraway (the narrator), Jay Gatsby who is the central subject of the novel, as well as Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Jordan Baker, Tom's lover Myrtle Wilson, and her husband George Wilson are secondary characters, though the Wilsons both play important roles during&nbsp;the story&rsquo;s climax, as Myrtle's death directly leads to George's murder of Gatsby.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The book also features other named characters, such as Meyer Wolfshiem and Dan Cody, but these mostly exist on the sidelines and do not play very direct roles in the story.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In what follows, we will give in-depth characterizations of the book&rsquo;s most important characters, before we briefly look at the secondary characters. At the end of this section, we will also discuss some of the key relationships between the various characters in the novel.</span></p><div  class="onpagetoc"><span class="onpagetoc-header" >Cuprins</span><ul><li><a title="Jay Gatsby" href="#heading-1">Jay Gatsby</a></li><li><a title="Daisy Buchanan" href="#heading-2">Daisy Buchanan</a></li><li><a title="Tom Buchanan" href="#heading-3">Tom Buchanan</a></li><li><a title="Nick Carraway" href="#heading-4">Nick Carraway</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="heading-1" data-guid="00b71137-bdb6-4bfb-9d0c-388dfd1da420">Jay Gatsby</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Jay Gatsby is the central subject of the novel <em>The Great Gatsby</em> by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gatsby is initially presented as highly <strong>mysterious</strong>, although the reader discovers more about him, his background and motivation, as the novel progresses. Incredibly wealthy but surprisingly young (around 30) Gatsby lives a life of luxury, throwing decadent parties every Saturday. It is later revealed that he only does this in the hope of attracting Daisy.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Gatsby cannot stand the idea of poverty, and all his life he has striven to be rich and sophisticated. He finally achieved this, but through dubious means, making money from organized crime and selling illegal goods. On the one hand, Gatsby's story of poverty to riches makes him <strong>the model of the American dream</strong>, rising beyond his station in life with a combination of hard work and intelligence. On the other hand, his is <strong>a corrupt version of this model</strong>, dirtying his hands through his association with criminals such as the notorious gambler Meyer Wolfshiem. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Also, Gatsby is <strong>ashamed of his lower-class roots</strong>, and tells Nick an obviously falsified story to cover them up, originally claiming that his family had a &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; of educating their sons at Oxford and that when they died he &ldquo;came into a good deal of money&rdquo; (p. 64). He later reveals the truth; that his &ldquo;his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people&rdquo; but that &ldquo;his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all&rdquo; (p. 95). He would like his acquaintances to think that his money came from an inheritance, rather than illegal business deals, but he fools no-one; he is laughed at by the rich and aristocratic Tom Buchanan for accepting a lunch invitation which was clearly made out of hollow politeness.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Gatsby is also following <strong>his own dream</strong>, that of being reunited with Daisy, whom he has loved for years but who is married to someone else. His dream has taken over his life and he is single-minded about achieving his goal. His friendship with Nick, for example, only begins to be established when he discovers that Nick is Daisy's cousin and consequently could help him reach out to her.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He is frequently depicted as a contemplative person, <strong>obsessed with his dreams but awkward in real life</strong>. For example, Nick first sees him standing outside in the dark, watching the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. &nbsp;As the novel goes on, Gatsby moves further and further away from the real world. He becomes increasingly tied up in his dream of what might be and is increasingly unrealistic about the likelihood of him achieving it. This is perhaps seen most clearly in his crazy response to Nick&rsquo;s advice that it is impossible to repeat the past:</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t repeat the past?&rsquo; he cried incredulously. &lsquo;Why of course you can!&rsquo; [...] &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to fix everything just the way it was before,&rsquo; he said, nodding determinedly. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;&nbsp;(p. 106)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The reader discovers very little about Gatsby in the early parts of the novel; he does not even speak a line of dialogue until Chapter III. <strong>The mystery and rumors surrounding him are all the reader knows</strong>, along with the details of his lavish parties, such as the fact that he orders &ldquo;five crates of oranges and lemons&rdquo; (p. 41) from New York every Friday and that the events are accompanied by a full orchestra, &ldquo;no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos&rdquo; (p. 42). The reader is therefore pulled into a glamorous view of Gatsby at first. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Fitzgerald's approach to revealing the secrets of Gatsby's past and present is <strong>theatrical</strong>, using devices such as Jordan's telling Nick that she has heard something &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; from Gatsby but not actually revealing what it is until the end of the following chapter. This echoes Gatsby's own theatrical creation of a new persona for himself, changing his name from James Gatz to Jay Gatsby and buying a showy house where he&nbsp;throws decadent parties.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In the end, <strong>Gatsby turns out to be quite naive and innocent in his perception of the world</strong>, convinced that money alone can solve his problems and bring Daisy back to him. Even after she has rejected him, he still defends her and tells Nick to &ldquo;remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her&rdquo; (p. 144). His death&nbsp;is a sad sign of the failure of his romantic and &ldquo;incorruptible&rdquo; (p. 147) dream, and also symbolically the failure of the great American dream for which he stands</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="f355f2ef-8518-41d9-821c-edfda73649e8">Daisy Buchanan</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Daisy Buchanan is fundamentally characterized as <strong>young, beautiful and somehow careless</strong>. Gatsby's great love for her and her indecision over him is the driving force behind the novel.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Daisy is constantly associated with things that are <strong>white and pure</strong>, and she is initially presented as one of the only simple and honest characters amongst a collection of complex, lying people. In contrast to the other characters, she seems childishly innocent, exclaiming when she finds a bruise on her finger, &ldquo;'Look!' she complained, &ldquo;I hurt it!&rdquo; (p. 17). She is particularly presented in contrast to her friend Jordan Baker, who is tanned (where Daisy is pale) and is described as &ldquo;incurably dishonest&rdquo; (p. 58) by Nick. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Daisy seems&nbsp;<strong>charming and sweet</strong> and the reader feels a degree of affection for her as the novel continues, willing her relationship with Gatsby to be what Gatsby hopes for: perfect. However, Daisy is somehow <strong>disappointing</strong> in the end. Despite having an affair with Gatsby, she cannot bring herself to leave Tom. This behavior does not fit Gatsby's dream of Daisy. Furthermore, this shallow and selfish version of Daisy does not match all the symbols of purity and innocence Fitzgerald has associated her with throughout the novel, and her decision, therefore, comes as a surprise for the reader.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We frequently get the sense that Daisy feels&nbsp;<strong>disillusioned</strong> with her upper class life, which she often seems to perceive as dull and meaningless. This comes across through both her general inactivity and some of the comments she makes about her own existence, such as &ldquo;You see I think everything&rsquo;s terrible anyhow&rdquo; (p. 22).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Although Daisy acts like a caring person in some ways, she can also be completely <strong>indifferent to people's suffering</strong>, and Nick ends up characterizing her as uncaring. Her relationship with her daughter is a case in point; Daisy has almost no interest at all in the little girl and shows her off like a doll or a possession, telling her &ldquo;your mother wanted to show you off&rdquo; (p. 112). She tells Nick that she hopes the girl will be &ldquo;a fool &ndash; that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool&rdquo; (p. 22).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Similarly, when the car hits and kills Myrtle, Daisy appears to feel no remorse at all. This is perhaps because of Myrtle's lower class status, and she is perfectly happy to let Gatsby (another non-aristocrat) take the blame. Following this, she does not even go to Gatsby's funeral. <strong>Daisy represents the aristocratic upper classes, who search only for a life of luxury and ease, leaving their problems to other people.</strong></span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="c9cf7f4b-6a00-45fc-b10e-5545a7a00250">Tom Buchanan</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Tom is Daisy's husband, and he is frequently characterized by his &ldquo;supercilious manner&rdquo; (p. 12) and his <strong>aristocratic snobbery</strong>. He is an athletic man who played football at Yale and first appears wearing riding clothes at a social event. His athleticism is evident in his body: &ldquo;you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage&mdash;a cruel body&rdquo; (p. 12).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Tom is <strong>aggressive and powerful</strong> and is easily moved to anger. Much of his power and self-confidence comes from the fact that he is descended from an extremely rich aristocratic family, and has extraordinary wealth at his disposal despite still being a young man. As Nick puts it, &ldquo;It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that [buy a string of polo ponies just because he felt like it]&rdquo; (p. 11).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Tom has strange and even <strong>racist</strong> views, which his friends and also the reader find disturbing. He is concerned for the survival of the Aryan race, worried that &ldquo;if we don't look out the white race will be&mdash;will be utterly submerged&rdquo; (p. 18). This is strange as from a rational point of view there is no real danger of the Aryan race being wiped out; this perhaps speaks to Tom's own insecurities about himself and his wife (Daisy is constantly associated with the color white), which are eventually realized in Daisy's affair with Gatsby.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Tom has a <strong>violent temper</strong>, which is particularly evident in his dealings with women. Daisy is afraid of his physical power, describing him as a &ldquo;brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen&hellip;&rdquo; (p. 17) This brutish nature clearly comes out when he breaks his lover Myrtle's nose after she has been chanting Daisy's name at a party to annoy him (p. 39).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He also has a deliberate mean side, enjoying talking down to George Wilson, whose wife he is having an affair with, and feeling he is better than Gatsby because Gatsby does not belong to an upper class family. Similarly, when he confronts Gatsby and Daisy about their affair and Daisy chooses Tom, he tells Gatsby to take Daisy home, saying &ldquo;Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over&rdquo; (p. 129). He does this to prove his <strong>psychological and social power</strong> over both Gatsby and Daisy and to underline the (possibly false) confidence in himself and his wife that he wants to show Gatsby.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Finally, Tom is also described as <strong>a hypocrite</strong>, since he does not follow his own moral code. It is well-established throughout the story that he has a long-time habit of pursuing affairs with various other women - which started a very short time after his marriage to Daisy and which Daisy even seems to be fully aware of. However, he is completely enraged when he learns of Daisy&rsquo;s affair with Gatsby, suggesting he believes its perfectly fine&nbsp;for himself to behave in this way, but completely unacceptable for his wife.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="318830fc-abcb-4c04-b1aa-b496a2366bfe">Nick Carraway</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Nick is the narrator of the novel, and it is through him that we discover all of the other important characters. As Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's cousin, he is the perfect figure to arrange the renewed affair between the pair and he is also the perfect character to narrate the novel. Fitzgerald manages to manipulate Nick's character so that he both participates in the action of the novel and acts as a semi-neutral bystander and commentator. This makes him both a credible character in the book and a good <strong>link to the reader</strong>, who is looking at&nbsp;the story from the outside.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick is by his own account <strong>quiet, introspective and a good listener</strong>, with a talent for making people trust him. Consequently, most of the major characters in the book take him into their confidence at some point. Gatsby, in particular, becomes willing to reveal the secrets of his past to him, telling Nick his life story &ldquo;at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him&rdquo; (p. 97). This makes Nick the perfect vessel for the facts of the novel to be revealed in a theatrical fashion.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Like Gatsby, Nick is <strong>meditative and thoughtful</strong>. Unlike with Gatsby, however, the reader is given an insight into his thoughts. This means that he is often able to express deep, symbolic interpretations of the events that occur throughout the story. A particularly famous example of this is Nick's thoughts about the American dream and its failings at the end of Chapter IX; he imagines Long Island without any houses, and how it &ldquo;once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams&rdquo; (p. 171). He compares this to the way that Gatsby and many other people, live their lives, chasing after a dream that &ldquo;year by year recedes before us&rdquo; (p. 171) until in the end we are like &ldquo;boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past&rdquo; (p. 172).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">As a Midwesterner who has come to New York, Nick represents <strong>a mixture of West and East America </strong>that is important in the novel. He is attracted to the luxurious and fast lifestyle of New York (as can be seen both in his fascination with Gatsby and his brief relationship with Jordan Baker), but he is simultaneously disgusted by it and by the people who inhabit New York's social circles at all levels. This becomes particularly clear at the end of the novel, when he finds that no-one is willing to attend Gatsby's funeral, and he finally decides to leave.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At the start of Nick's narrative, he is a young man seeking his fortune on the East coast. As the story proceeds, Nick becomes well acquainted with <strong>the power and pitfalls of wealth and fame</strong>. By the end of the novel he is determined to return to a simpler life in the West, having learned about the sadness that huge wealth can create and the shallowness of upper class society in the East.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">As a final note, it is interesting to consider&nbsp;that many of the other characters in the book seem very <strong>eager to gain Nick&rsquo;s approva</strong>l - suggesting that even though most of them are fundamentally immoral characters, they still wish&nbsp;to be viewed as good people.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="structure.html" title="Structure of The Great Gatsby" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Structure</span></a><a href="characters/other.html" title="Other characters in The Great Gatsby" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Other characters</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Scott Fitzgerald. Gatsby is initially presented as highly \u003cstrong\u003emysterious\u003c/strong\u003e, although the reader discovers more about him, his background and motivation, as the novel progresses. Incredibly wealthy but surprisingly young (around 30) Gatsby lives a life of luxury, throwing decadent parties every Saturday. It is later revealed that he only does this in the hope of attracting Daisy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eGatsby cannot stand the idea of poverty, and all his life he has striven to be rich and sophisticated. He finally achieved this, but through dubious means, making money from organized crime and selling illegal goods. On the one hand, Gatsby\u0027s story of poverty to riches makes him \u003cstrong\u003ethe model of the American dream\u003c/strong\u003e, rising beyond his station in life with a combination of hard work and intelligence. On the other hand, his is \u003cstrong\u003ea corrupt version of this model\u003c/strong\u003e, dirtying his hands through his association with criminals such as the notorious gambler Meyer Wolfshiem. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAlso, Gatsby is \u003cstrong\u003eashamed of his lower-class roots\u003c/strong\u003e, and tells Nick an obviously falsified story to cover them up, originally claiming that his family had a \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo; of educating their sons at Oxford and that when they died he \u0026ldquo;came into a good deal of money\u0026rdquo; (p. 64). He later reveals the truth; that his \u0026ldquo;his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people\u0026rdquo; but that \u0026ldquo;his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all\u0026rdquo; (p. 95). He would like his acquaintances to think that his money came from an inheritance, rather than illegal business deals, but he fools no-one; he is laughed at by the rich and aristocratic Tom Buchanan for accepting a lunch invitation which was clearly made out of hollow politeness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eGatsby is also following \u003cstrong\u003ehis own dream\u003c/strong\u003e, that of being reunited with Daisy, whom he has loved for years but who is married to someone else. His dream has taken over his life and he is single-minded about achieving his goal. His friendship with Nick, for example, only begins to be established when he discovers that Nick is Daisy\u0027s cousin and consequently could help him reach out to her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eHe is frequently depicted as a contemplative person, \u003cstrong\u003eobsessed with his dreams but awkward in real life\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, Nick first sees him standing outside in the dark, watching the green light at the end of Daisy\u0027s dock. \u0026nbsp;As the novel goes on, Gatsby moves further and further away from the real world. He becomes increasingly tied up in his dream of what might be and is increasingly unrealistic about the likelihood of him achieving it. This is perhaps seen most clearly in his crazy response to Nick\u0026rsquo;s advice that it is impossible to repeat the past:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003e\u0026lsquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t repeat the past?\u0026rsquo; he cried incredulously. \u0026lsquo;Why of course you can!\u0026rsquo; [...] \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to fix everything just the way it was before,\u0026rsquo; he said, nodding determinedly. \u0026lsquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 106)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe reader discovers very little about Gatsby in the early parts of the novel; he does not even speak a line of dialogue until Chapter III. \u003cstrong\u003eThe mystery and rumors surrounding him are all the reader knows\u003c/strong\u003e, along with the details of his lavish parties, such as the fact that he orders \u0026ldquo;five crates of oranges and lemons\u0026rdquo; (p. 41) from New York every Friday and that the events are accompanied by a full orchestra, \u0026ldquo;no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos\u0026rdquo; (p. 42). The reader is therefore pulled into a glamorous view of Gatsby at first. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eFitzgerald\u0027s approach to revealing the secrets of Gatsby\u0027s past and present is \u003cstrong\u003etheatrical\u003c/strong\u003e, using devices such as Jordan\u0027s telling Nick that she has heard something \u0026ldquo;amazing\u0026rdquo; from Gatsby but not actually revealing what it is until the end of the following chapter. This echoes Gatsby\u0027s own theatrical creation of a new persona for himself, changing his name from James Gatz to Jay Gatsby and buying a showy house where he\u0026nbsp;throws decadent parties.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIn the end, \u003cstrong\u003eGatsby turns out to be quite naive and innocent in his perception of the world\u003c/strong\u003e, convinced that money alone can solve his problems and bring Daisy back to him. Even after she has rejected him, he still defends her and tells Nick to \u0026ldquo;remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her\u0026rdquo; (p. 144). His death\u0026nbsp;is a sad sign of the failure of his romantic and \u0026ldquo;incorruptible\u0026rdquo; (p. 147) dream, and also symbolically the failure of the great American dream for which he stands\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f355f2ef-8518-41d9-821c-edfda73649e8\u0022\u003eDaisy Buchanan\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eDaisy Buchanan is fundamentally characterized as \u003cstrong\u003eyoung, beautiful and somehow careless\u003c/strong\u003e. Gatsby\u0027s great love for her and her indecision over him is the driving force behind the novel.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eDaisy is constantly associated with things that are \u003cstrong\u003ewhite and pure\u003c/strong\u003e, and she is initially presented as one of the only simple and honest characters amongst a collection of complex, lying people. In contrast to the other characters, she seems childishly innocent, exclaiming when she finds a bruise on her finger, \u0026ldquo;\u0027Look!\u0027 she complained, \u0026ldquo;I hurt it!\u0026rdquo; (p. 17). She is particularly presented in contrast to her friend Jordan Baker, who is tanned (where Daisy is pale) and is described as \u0026ldquo;incurably dishonest\u0026rdquo; (p. 58) by Nick. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eDaisy seems\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003echarming and sweet\u003c/strong\u003e and the reader feels a degree of affection for her as the novel continues, willing her relationship with Gatsby to be what Gatsby hopes for: perfect. However, Daisy is somehow \u003cstrong\u003edisappointing\u003c/strong\u003e in the end. Despite having an affair with Gatsby, she cannot bring herself to leave Tom. This behavior does not fit Gatsby\u0027s dream of Daisy. Furthermore, this shallow and selfish version of Daisy does not match all the symbols of purity and innocence Fitzgerald has associated her with throughout the novel, and her decision, therefore, comes as a surprise for the reader.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWe frequently get the sense that Daisy feels\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003edisillusioned\u003c/strong\u003e with her upper class life, which she often seems to perceive as dull and meaningless. This comes across through both her general inactivity and some of the comments she makes about her own existence, such as \u0026ldquo;You see I think everything\u0026rsquo;s terrible anyhow\u0026rdquo; (p. 22).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAlthough Daisy acts like a caring person in some ways, she can also be completely \u003cstrong\u003eindifferent to people\u0027s suffering\u003c/strong\u003e, and Nick ends up characterizing her as uncaring. Her relationship with her daughter is a case in point; Daisy has almost no interest at all in the little girl and shows her off like a doll or a possession, telling her \u0026ldquo;your mother wanted to show you off\u0026rdquo; (p. 112). She tells Nick that she hopes the girl will be \u0026ldquo;a fool \u0026ndash; that\u0027s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool\u0026rdquo; (p. 22).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSimilarly, when the car hits and kills Myrtle, Daisy appears to feel no remorse at all. This is perhaps because of Myrtle\u0027s lower class status, and she is perfectly happy to let Gatsby (another non-aristocrat) take the blame. Following this, she does not even go to Gatsby\u0027s funeral. \u003cstrong\u003eDaisy represents the aristocratic upper classes, who search only for a life of luxury and ease, leaving their problems to other people.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c9cf7f4b-6a00-45fc-b10e-5545a7a00250\u0022\u003eTom Buchanan\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTom is Daisy\u0027s husband, and he is frequently characterized by his \u0026ldquo;supercilious manner\u0026rdquo; (p. 12) and his \u003cstrong\u003earistocratic snobbery\u003c/strong\u003e. He is an athletic man who played football at Yale and first appears wearing riding clothes at a social event. His athleticism is evident in his body: \u0026ldquo;you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage\u0026mdash;a cruel body\u0026rdquo; (p. 12).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTom is \u003cstrong\u003eaggressive and powerful\u003c/strong\u003e and is easily moved to anger. Much of his power and self-confidence comes from the fact that he is descended from an extremely rich aristocratic family, and has extraordinary wealth at his disposal despite still being a young man. As Nick puts it, \u0026ldquo;It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that [buy a string of polo ponies just because he felt like it]\u0026rdquo; (p. 11).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTom has strange and even \u003cstrong\u003eracist\u003c/strong\u003e views, which his friends and also the reader find disturbing. He is concerned for the survival of the Aryan race, worried that \u0026ldquo;if we don\u0027t look out the white race will be\u0026mdash;will be utterly submerged\u0026rdquo; (p. 18). This is strange as from a rational point of view there is no real danger of the Aryan race being wiped out; this perhaps speaks to Tom\u0027s own insecurities about himself and his wife (Daisy is constantly associated with the color white), which are eventually realized in Daisy\u0027s affair with Gatsby.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTom has a \u003cstrong\u003eviolent temper\u003c/strong\u003e, which is particularly evident in his dealings with women. Daisy is afraid of his physical power, describing him as a \u0026ldquo;brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (p. 17) This brutish nature clearly comes out when he breaks his lover Myrtle\u0027s nose after she has been chanting Daisy\u0027s name at a party to annoy him (p. 39).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eHe also has a deliberate mean side, enjoying talking down to George Wilson, whose wife he is having an affair with, and feeling he is better than Gatsby because Gatsby does not belong to an upper class family. Similarly, when he confronts Gatsby and Daisy about their affair and Daisy chooses Tom, he tells Gatsby to take Daisy home, saying \u0026ldquo;Go on. He won\u0027t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over\u0026rdquo; (p. 129). He does this to prove his \u003cstrong\u003epsychological and social power\u003c/strong\u003e over both Gatsby and Daisy and to underline the (possibly false) confidence in himself and his wife that he wants to show Gatsby.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eFinally, Tom is also described as \u003cstrong\u003ea hypocrite\u003c/strong\u003e, since he does not follow his own moral code. It is well-established throughout the story that he has a long-time habit of pursuing affairs with various other women - which started a very short time after his marriage to Daisy and which Daisy even seems to be fully aware of. However, he is completely enraged when he learns of Daisy\u0026rsquo;s affair with Gatsby, suggesting he believes its perfectly fine\u0026nbsp;for himself to behave in this way, but completely unacceptable for his wife.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022318830fc-abcb-4c04-b1aa-b496a2366bfe\u0022\u003eNick Carraway\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNick is the narrator of the novel, and it is through him that we discover all of the other important characters. As Gatsby\u0027s neighbor and Daisy\u0027s cousin, he is the perfect figure to arrange the renewed affair between the pair and he is also the perfect character to narrate the novel. Fitzgerald manages to manipulate Nick\u0027s character so that he both participates in the action of the novel and acts as a semi-neutral bystander and commentator. This makes him both a credible character in the book and a good \u003cstrong\u003elink to the reader\u003c/strong\u003e, who is looking at\u0026nbsp;the story from the outside.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNick is by his own account \u003cstrong\u003equiet, introspective and a good listener\u003c/strong\u003e, with a talent for making people trust him. Consequently, most of the major characters in the book take him into their confidence at some point. Gatsby, in particular, becomes willing to reveal the secrets of his past to him, telling Nick his life story \u0026ldquo;at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him\u0026rdquo; (p. 97). This makes Nick the perfect vessel for the facts of the novel to be revealed in a theatrical fashion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eLike Gatsby, Nick is \u003cstrong\u003emeditative and thoughtful\u003c/strong\u003e. Unlike with Gatsby, however, the reader is given an insight into his thoughts. This means that he is often able to express deep, symbolic interpretations of the events that occur throughout the story. A particularly famous example of this is Nick\u0027s thoughts about the American dream and its failings at the end of Chapter IX; he imagines Long Island without any houses, and how it \u0026ldquo;once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams\u0026rdquo; (p. 171). He compares this to the way that Gatsby and many other people, live their lives, chasing after a dream that \u0026ldquo;year by year recedes before us\u0026rdquo; (p. 171) until in the end we are like \u0026ldquo;boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\u0026rdquo; (p. 172).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAs a Midwesterner who has come to New York, Nick represents \u003cstrong\u003ea mixture of West and East America \u003c/strong\u003ethat is important in the novel. He is attracted to the luxurious and fast lifestyle of New York (as can be seen both in his fascination with Gatsby and his brief relationship with Jordan Baker), but he is simultaneously disgusted by it and by the people who inhabit New York\u0027s social circles at all levels. This becomes particularly clear at the end of the novel, when he finds that no-one is willing to attend Gatsby\u0027s funeral, and he finally decides to leave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt the start of Nick\u0027s narrative, he is a young man seeking his fortune on the East coast.
