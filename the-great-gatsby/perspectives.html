Since Fitzgerald wrote the book just a couple of years after the book&rsquo;s time setting, the book is closely inspired by Fitzgerald's own time and experiences and so has a particular historical context.</span></p><h3 id="heading-2">Politics</h3><p><span style="color:black;">To better understand the novel&rsquo;s historical context, it is useful to know that the US experienced significant economic growth after the First World War had ended in 1918, with industry and trade doing well. This gave rise to an era of prosperity known as &ldquo;The Jazz Age&rdquo; (a term coined by Fitzgerald) or &ldquo;The Roaring Twenties&rdquo;, and many people became very wealthy. This included many former members of the lower and middle classes, and society was quickly changed by this shift in money. Many of the aristocratic families maintained their wealth, but increasingly people from non-traditional backgrounds (like Gatsby) were building large houses and changing the way society was structured.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Politically, there was also a large change in the position of women, who were granted the right to vote across the country in 1920. During the First World War, many women had enjoyed greater freedom and taken up many jobs traditionally done by men. Many continued to pursue this freedom in the 1920s, often seeking financial independence or employment. Notably, in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, Jordan Baker makes her living as a professional golfer.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In 1929, the Wall Street crash marked an abrupt end to the Jazz Age, plunging the US into economic depression within a short span of time. In a way, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> is almost prophetic with regards to this event, with the novel&rsquo;s focus on the fragile nature of dreams and the contrast between illusion and reality. In many ways, The Wall Street crash happened precisely because investors were increasingly out of touch with reality - caught up in the optimistic spirit of the times, they eagerly bought stocks and countless companies were eventually valued far beyond their actual value and the actual goods they produced. </span></p><h3 id="heading-3">Culture</h3><p><span style="color:black;">During the 1920s, clothing, architecture and design became more daring. Women's dresses became much shorter than they had previously been, and waistlines were dropped to create a more boyish figure. This was a symbol of the sexual freedom aimed for by many people at this time. Similarly, cars had become a popular and more affordable form of transport, and many of them were created in bright colors and stylish designs. For example, Gatsby's car is a highly recognisable yellow Rolls Royce.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At this time, jazz had become a very popular form of music. This even gave the era its popular name, the Jazz Age. Jazz was an informal type of music originating in African-American communities, characterized by the use of improvisation and a strong sense of rhythm. It made particular use of instruments such as the trumpet, double bass, and piano. It was ideal for the popular dancing that took place at parties such as Gatsby's and night clubs or '</span><span style="color:black;">speakeasies'</span><span style="color:black;">.</span></p><h3 id="heading-4">Lifestyle</h3><p><span style="color:black;">The Jazz Age lifestyle present in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> is to some extent the one that F. Scott Fitzgerald himself lived. It is important to note that this was not the life lived by a majority of people, as it was mainly enjoyed by the very rich.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">This lifestyle in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and the &ldquo;Jazz Age&rdquo; was characterized by wild parties, where people danced to jazz music and enjoyed large amounts of extravagant food and drink. Private parties and secret clubs were important in the 1920s since the Prohibition Act was passed in 1919. This law prohibited&nbsp;the sale (but not the consumption) of alcohol, and this set the tone of many social gatherings.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Most of the very rich, especially aristocrats and women, did not work. Instead, they filled their time with social engagements. Frequently, however, their lifestyle meant that they did very little. When Nick enters the Buchanans' house, for example, he finds Daisy and Jordan sitting on the sofa, almost unable to get up after their long inactivity.</span></p><h2 data-guid="1c76c3ac-06c9-4233-86bb-5cdd22c5bff8" id="heading-5">Literary perspective</h2><p><span style="color:black;">F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote <em>The Great Gatsby</em> at a time when Modernism was the main literary movement. The 1920s was an era which produced many well-known American authors, including Fitzgerald himself, his wife Zelda (who was also a talented author), Sinclair Lewis, &nbsp;Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Like authors such as Hemingway and Stein, Fitzgerald's form of modernism involved exploring the &ldquo;modern condition&rdquo; of the human being, or what it meant to be alive in the modern age. Like many other American modernists, Fitzgerald spent some time traveling in Europe, among&nbsp;other famous writers such as Ernest Hemingway. However, unlike many modernists such as Hemingway and Pound, Fitzgerald always returned to live in the United States. Because of this, Fitzgerald's novels capture a particularly American way of life.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The form of the novel was being explored by many authors at this time, pushing the boundaries of what could be produced. Modernism in the United States was frequently concerned with the American condition, the psychological problems created by the First World War, and how the self is created through a constructed identity or &ldquo;mask&rdquo; with which the individual faces society. All of these are themes explored by Fitzgerald in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.</span></p><h2 data-guid="eeca3084-d593-4a7d-8010-95df292585b2" id="heading-6">Textual perspective</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Here you can find suggestions for other texts that deal with similar themes and may be useful to compare to <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. The most obvious choice may be comparison to other fictional texts, but depending on how you are working with the novel, it may also be relevant to bring up non-fiction works such as speeches and interviews.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-7">Fiction</h3><p><em><strong><span style="color:black;">The Grapes of Wrath </span></strong></em><strong><span style="color:black;">by John Steinbeck</span></strong><span style="color:black;"> is another iconic American novel. Despite the wildly different plotlines, it is may be useful to compare it to <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, since it deals with the decade immediately following the luxurious Jazz Age. <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> thus zooms in on The Great Depression that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929, focusing on the struggles of a family desperately traveling the US in search of work. The vivid descriptions of starvation, disease and other hardships make&nbsp;a stark contrast to Gatsby&rsquo;s luxurious parties in the previous decade. It is interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Steinbeck intended their novels to be a strong criticism of the corruption of American society, although they achieved this in very different ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">For a more modern perspective, you might wish to take a look at <em><strong>American Psycho</strong></em></span><strong><span style="color:black;"> by Brett Easton Ellis</span></strong><span style="color:black;">. This modern-day American classic focuses on describing&nbsp;the emptiness of upper-class life in the US of the late&nbsp;<em>1980s</em>, specifically the </span><span style="color:black;">yuppie</span><span style="color:black;"> culture. Patrick Bateman, the main character and narrator, is so disillusioned by his life that he finds&nbsp;excitement&nbsp;through a series of psychotic murders, which are all described in great detail. This feature makes the book much more shocking and grotesque than <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, despite its somewhat similar message about the potential emptiness of upper-class life in a capitalistic consumer&nbsp;society.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-8">Non-fiction</h3><p>The idea of the American Dream is still a popular reference point in American politics. Barack Obama typically put an unusually social spin on the idea, focusing on the view that American society ought to be structured in a way that makes it as easy as possible for citizens to achieve the dream. That is one of his main points in this early campaign speech, delivered&nbsp;before he was elected President.</p><p>In an 1980 interview, the successful American immigrant Arnold Schwarzenegger offers his extremely optimistic perspective on America and the American dream.

Since Fitzgerald wrote the book just a couple of years after the book\u0026rsquo;s time setting, the book is closely inspired by Fitzgerald\u0027s own time and experiences and so has a particular historical context.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003ePolitics\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTo better understand the novel\u0026rsquo;s historical context, it is useful to know that the US experienced significant economic growth after the First World War had ended in 1918, with industry and trade doing well. This gave rise to an era of prosperity known as \u0026ldquo;The Jazz Age\u0026rdquo; (a term coined by Fitzgerald) or \u0026ldquo;The Roaring Twenties\u0026rdquo;, and many people became very wealthy. This included many former members of the lower and middle classes, and society was quickly changed by this shift in money. Many of the aristocratic families maintained their wealth, but increasingly people from non-traditional backgrounds (like Gatsby) were building large houses and changing the way society was structured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003ePolitically, there was also a large change in the position of women, who were granted the right to vote across the country in 1920. During the First World War, many women had enjoyed greater freedom and taken up many jobs traditionally done by men. Many continued to pursue this freedom in the 1920s, often seeking financial independence or employment. Notably, in \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e, Jordan Baker makes her living as a professional golfer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIn 1929, the Wall Street crash marked an abrupt end to the Jazz Age, plunging the US into economic depression within a short span of time. In a way, \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e is almost prophetic with regards to this event, with the novel\u0026rsquo;s focus on the fragile nature of dreams and the contrast between illusion and reality. In many ways, The Wall Street crash happened precisely because investors were increasingly out of touch with reality - caught up in the optimistic spirit of the times, they eagerly bought stocks and countless companies were eventually valued far beyond their actual value and the actual goods they produced. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eCulture\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eDuring the 1920s, clothing, architecture and design became more daring. Women\u0027s dresses became much shorter than they had previously been, and waistlines were dropped to create a more boyish figure. This was a symbol of the sexual freedom aimed for by many people at this time. Similarly, cars had become a popular and more affordable form of transport, and many of them were created in bright colors and stylish designs. For example, Gatsby\u0027s car is a highly recognisable yellow Rolls Royce.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt this time, jazz had become a very popular form of music. This even gave the era its popular name, the Jazz Age. Jazz was an informal type of music originating in African-American communities, characterized by the use of improvisation and a strong sense of rhythm. It made particular use of instruments such as the trumpet, double bass, and piano. It was ideal for the popular dancing that took place at parties such as Gatsby\u0027s and night clubs or \u0027\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003espeakeasies\u0027\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eLifestyle\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe Jazz Age lifestyle present in \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e is to some extent the one that F. Scott Fitzgerald himself lived. It is important to note that this was not the life lived by a majority of people, as it was mainly enjoyed by the very rich.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThis lifestyle in \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e and the \u0026ldquo;Jazz Age\u0026rdquo; was characterized by wild parties, where people danced to jazz music and enjoyed large amounts of extravagant food and drink. Private parties and secret clubs were important in the 1920s since the Prohibition Act was passed in 1919. This law prohibited\u0026nbsp;the sale (but not the consumption) of alcohol, and this set the tone of many social gatherings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMost of the very rich, especially aristocrats and women, did not work. Instead, they filled their time with social engagements. Frequently, however, their lifestyle meant that they did very little. When Nick enters the Buchanans\u0027 house, for example, he finds Daisy and Jordan sitting on the sofa, almost unable to get up after their long inactivity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00221c76c3ac-06c9-4233-86bb-5cdd22c5bff8\u0022 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022\u003eLiterary perspective\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eF. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e at a time when Modernism was the main literary movement. The 1920s was an era which produced many well-known American authors, including Fitzgerald himself, his wife Zelda (who was also a talented author), Sinclair Lewis, \u0026nbsp;Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eLike authors such as Hemingway and Stein, Fitzgerald\u0027s form of modernism involved exploring the \u0026ldquo;modern condition\u0026rdquo; of the human being, or what it meant to be alive in the modern age. Like many other American modernists, Fitzgerald spent some time traveling in Europe, among\u0026nbsp;other famous writers such as Ernest Hemingway. However, unlike many modernists such as Hemingway and Pound, Fitzgerald always returned to live in the United States. Because of this, Fitzgerald\u0027s novels capture a particularly American way of life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe form of the novel was being explored by many authors at this time, pushing the boundaries of what could be produced. Modernism in the United States was frequently concerned with the American condition, the psychological problems created by the First World War, and how the self is created through a constructed identity or \u0026ldquo;mask\u0026rdquo; with which the individual faces society. All of these are themes explored by Fitzgerald in \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022eeca3084-d593-4a7d-8010-95df292585b2\u0022 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022\u003eTextual perspective\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eHere you can find suggestions for other texts that deal with similar themes and may be useful to compare to \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e. The most obvious choice may be comparison to other fictional texts, but depending on how you are working with the novel, it may also be relevant to bring up non-fiction works such as speeches and interviews.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022\u003eFiction\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe Grapes of Wrath \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eby John Steinbeck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003e is another iconic American novel. Despite the wildly different plotlines, it is may be useful to compare it to \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e, since it deals with the decade immediately following the luxurious Jazz Age. \u003cem\u003eThe Grapes of Wrath\u003c/em\u003e thus zooms in on The Great Depression that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929, focusing on the struggles of a family desperately traveling the US in search of work. The vivid descriptions of starvation, disease and other hardships make\u0026nbsp;a stark contrast to Gatsby\u0026rsquo;s luxurious parties in the previous decade. It is interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Steinbeck intended their novels to be a strong criticism of the corruption of American society, although they achieved this in very different ways. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eFor a more modern perspective, you might wish to take a look at \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmerican Psycho\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003e by Brett Easton Ellis\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003e.

Patrick Bateman, the main character and narrator, is so disillusioned by his life that he finds\u0026nbsp;excitement\u0026nbsp;through a series of psychotic murders, which are all described in great detail. This feature makes the book much more shocking and grotesque than \u003cem\u003eThe Great Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e, despite its somewhat similar message about the potential emptiness of upper-class life in a capitalistic consumer\u0026nbsp;society.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022\u003eNon-fiction\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea of the American Dream is still a popular reference point in American politics.
