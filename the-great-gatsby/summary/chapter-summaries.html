He describes his background, his education at Yale and his sense of what he calls moral justice. The reader learns that the events of the novel took place a year earlier and that Nick is recalling them from his memory.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The narrative begins when Nick moves from his home in the Midwest to the fictional West Egg on Long Island, where he rents a small house next door to a large Gothic mansion. Nick has moved there looking for excitement and hopes to make a career as a bond trader.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">West Egg is considered unfashionable because it is home to people with &ldquo;new money&rdquo;, whose wealth comes from recent success in trade or shares and who consequently have no traditional social connections. Nick discovers that his neighbor is a mysterious millionaire called Gatsby; he knows nothing about Gatsby except that he throws lavish parties every Saturday night.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">On the other side of the bay is the more fashionable East Egg, where the more traditionally conservative and aristocratic rich families live. Nick has connections in East Egg, as it is where his cousin Daisy lives with her husband, Tom Buchanan. Nick goes for dinner at the couple's house and meets Tom, a powerful-looking man. He is also introduced to Jordan Baker, a beautiful young woman who is a keen golfer and who often looks distant and bored.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Tom runs out to take a phone call, and Jordan tells Nick that it is Tom's lover. Nick returns home, and when he arrives, he sees his neighbor standing in his garden and stretching his arms out towards the water. Nick looks out, but he can only see a green light marking the end of a dock on the other side of the bay.</span></p><h2 data-guid="97cd2bff-bff1-400e-87e5-05247a5d56bd" id="heading-2">Chapter II</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Chapter II&nbsp;opens with a description of the valley of ashes, a gray wasteland between New York and West Egg. The area is watched over by the large disembodied eyes of Dr T J Eckleburg, which stare down from an old billboard poster advertising the services of an optician. One day Tom takes Nick to the valley of ashes on their way in to New York, where they visit George Wilson's garage. It turns out that Tom is having an affair with George's wife Myrtle.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Tom takes Nick and Myrtle into New York, where he keeps an apartment in which to have his affair. Joined by Myrtle's sister and another couple called the McKees, they have a party which soon turns drunken and unpleasant. Nick is disgusted by the behavior of the guests and tries to leave, despite being very drunk himself, but he is somehow fascinated by their vulgarity.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Tom gives Myrtle a puppy as a gift, and Myrtle becomes increasingly outspoken. She starts talking about Daisy and when Tom tells her not to, she becomes angry and begins saying Daisy's name over and over again. In a fit of rage, Tom breaks Myrtle's nose. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Very drunk, Nick leaves the party to help Mr McKee home and then takes the train back to West Egg at four in the morning.</span></p><h2 data-guid="ca443b23-ab26-4ed4-aa95-9b00eb29d79c" id="heading-3">Chapter III</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Nick opens the chapter with a general description of Gatsby's infamous parties, which happen every weekend in the summer months. He gives a detailed description of the guests, decorations and refreshments that are involved in these events.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">On one occasion, Gatsby's driver brings Nick a formal invitation to one of these parties and he decides to attend - excited to finally meet his neighbor. At the party, Nick at first feels lost among the crowds of people he does not know and he is unable to locate Gatsby. He meets Jordan Baker, and they both hear many different rumors about who Gatsby is and how he made his money.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The party is extraordinarily decadent&nbsp;and the guests get increasingly drunk. Jordan and Nick meet a strange man wearing glasses in Gatsby's library whom Nick names &ldquo;Owl Eyes&rdquo;. They then start talking to a handsome young man on the terrace who turns out to be their host, Jay Gatsby.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick describes Gatsby&rsquo;s formal English accent and his habit of calling everyone &ldquo;old sport&rdquo;. He also notes how Gatsby does not really join the party, but seems content to watch his guests from the sidelines. Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and when she returns to Nick she claims to have&nbsp;learned something amazing. The party breaks up and Nick returns home, walking past a place where a guest has drunkenly crashed his car.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick then describes his daily life in order to give the reader a fuller picture of the events of the summer, explaining his routine of working and meeting women in New York City. Towards the middle of the summer, he meets up with Jordan Baker and gradually begins a romantic relationship with her, despite admitting to not actually being in love.</span></p><h2 data-guid="5241005a-3f3f-479a-a503-41ee41c92d6d" id="heading-4">Chapter IV</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Nick gives a list of some of the famous and fashionable people who attend Gatsby's parties. He then describes a trip to New York he took with Gatsby. While driving, Gatsby seems determined to tell Nick about his past, producing a dubious story about being the son of a wealthy Midwestern family and having been educated at Oxford. He claims that during the War he &ldquo;tried very hard to die&rdquo;, but somehow found his life was &ldquo;enchanted&rdquo; (p. 64).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Gatsby is stopped for speeding, but he is let off when he shows a card from a prominent police commissioner. At lunch, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a notorious gambler who is said to have fixed the 1919 World Series</span>. Nick begins to suspect that Gatsby and his wealth may be linked to underground organized crime networks.</p><p><span style="color:black;">Later in the day, Nick meets Jordan Baker, who reveals what Gatsby told her in private at the party. She tells Nick that Gatsby is madly in love with Daisy. She explains how Daisy and Gatsby fell in love during the War, when he was stationed in her hometown. However, Daisy chose to marry Tom Buchanan instead whilst Gatsby was away, a choice of which her parents and peers approved. She was uncertain about her choice the night before her wedding, but decided to go through with it anyway. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Jordan says that Gatsby gained his enormous wealth in the hope of impressing Daisy and moved to West Egg to be near her. Through Jordan, Gatsby asks Nick to arrange a meeting between them, by inviting Daisy to tea and having Gatsby turn up unannounced.</span></p><h2 data-guid="cb61be9d-7959-4cdc-979d-0361b391e413" id="heading-5">Chapter V</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Nick comes home to West Egg to find Gatsby's mansion lit up but deserted. He then goes to the garden and finds Gatsby, who seems desperate to please him. Nick tells Gatsby that he will arrange the meeting with Daisy; Gatsby is immensely grateful and offers to set Nick up in a business deal in return. Slightly offended, Nick declines the offer, but organizes the meeting anyway. He instructs Daisy not to bring Tom along for the visit. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The day of the meeting is rainy and Gatsby becomes very nervous, sending someone to cut Nick's lawn and filling his house with flowers. When Daisy arrives Gatsby is nowhere to be seen, but he soon arrives. The meeting between the pair is very awkward at first, but eventually Nick decides to leave them alone. When he returns, they have been fully reunited and both seem happy, though Daisy has tears in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Gatsby takes Nick and Daisy to his house to show off his possessions. Daisy finds his luxurious house and life wonderful and is overwhelmed with tears when he shows her his collection of beautiful shirts. Nick, however, wonders whether Daisy can live up to Gatsby's greatly romanticized image of her. He soon realizes that, their passion for each other rediscovered, they have forgotten he is there and he leaves.</span></p><h2 data-guid="066d9dee-5cf3-4f2f-9f35-d6df40abf001" id="heading-6">Chapter VI</h2><p><span style="color:black;">A reporter comes to try and interview Gatsby at his house, fueled by increasingly wild rumors being spread about Gatsby in New York. At this point, Nick interrupts the narrative with the true story of Gatsby's background, which he has only discovered recently.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Jay Gatsby was born James Gatz in North Dakota. He started to attend college in Minnesota, but dropped out two weeks later, instead spending his time fishing on Lake Superior. One day, he went out in a rowing boat to the yacht of a rich industrialist, Dan Cody, to warn him about a coming storm. Grateful for the warning and intrigued by the young man&rsquo;s confidence, Cody invited him to be his personal assistant and James Gatz reinvented himself as Jay Gatsby. When Cody died, he left Gatsby a large sum of money, but unfortunately Gatsby was not able to claim it, because Cody&rsquo;s widow managed to secure everything for herself. Instead, Gatsby committed himself to becoming rich and powerful through his own means.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick arrives at Gatsby's mansion one day to find Tom Buchanan visiting there. Gatsby is awkward with his aristocratic guests, and he eventually accepts an invitation to have dinner, not realizing that he has been invited out of hollow politeness and that he was not actually expected to go.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The next weekend, Tom, Daisy and Nick attend one of Gatsby's parties, which does not seem to be as much fun as previously. Tom is insulting and Daisy is anxious, trying to defend Gatsby and the dubious source of his wealth. Gatsby is unhappy after the party ends, disappointed that Daisy did not enjoy herself. He wants everything to go back to how it was when they were young and in love, and believes he can achieve this with his wealth. Nick reflects that since Gatsby has been reunited with Daisy, the dream which has been urging Gatsby on in life is effectively over.</span></p><h2 data-guid="de62711a-7bf2-4300-8a6b-16a815fe4d02" id="heading-7">Chapter VII</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Gatsby makes the sudden decision to cancel his infamous parties and replaces all his servants, afraid his staff will spread gossip about him and Daisy. On the hottest day of the year, Nick, Jordan and Gatsby go for lunch at the Buchanans' in East Egg. Daisy's daughter is brought in, but Daisy seems uninterested in her child, while Gatsby can hardly believe her existence. The lunch party is very awkward, and a few looks and remarks exchanged by Gatsby and Daisy eventually convinces Tom that the pair are having an affair.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Eager to challenge Gatsby, Tom forces everyone to drive into town and take a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Daisy rides with Gatsby, while Tom, Jordan and Nick ride together. Tom stops for gas at Wilson&rsquo;s garage, where he learns that George Wilson has finally discovered that his wife Myrtle is having an affair - though he is still unaware that Tom is her lover. He tells Tom that he plans to move away with his wife, which leaves Tom in further distress. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At the hotel, Tom questions Gatsby about his habits and history and confronts him about the affair. Gatsby claims that Daisy loves him, and not Tom, whereas Tom claims he and Daisy have a history Gatsby could never understand. At the same time, he reveals that Gatsby has been involved in numerous criminal activities. Daisy is ultimately unwilling to reject Tom and admits her loyalty to him, and Tom tells Gatsby to drive Daisy back to East Egg.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">On the return journey, Tom, Nick and Jordan discover that Myrtle, Tom's lover, has been hit by Gatsby's car and killed. When they return to the house, Gatsby tells Nick that it was Daisy who was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for it. Nick discovers that Tom and Daisy have made up their differences, and Gatsby is left alone.</span></p><h2 data-guid="6d931f78-8c66-4916-b981-8be5ba5a2045" id="heading-8">Chapter VIII</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The next morning, Nick goes to Gatsby's mansion, where his neighbor has just returned after staying all night outside the Buchanans' house. He tells Nick that nothing happened during his watch. Nick suggests that Gatsby leave the area and forget about Daisy, worried that his car will be identified as the one that hit Myrtle.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Gatsby instead chooses to tell Nick the true story of his past, describing his first relationship with Daisy in detail. He claims she agreed to wait to marry him after the War, but then married Tom instead while Gatsby was away studying in Oxford. Gatsby's groundsman interrupts and tells Gatsby he plans to drain the swimming pool. Gatsby asks him to wait for a day so he can use it. Nick goes to work, telling Gatsby he is worth more than the Buchanans and all their friends combined.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick then explains to the reader what happened in the valley of ashes after Myrtle's death. George Wilson had confronted Myrtle about the affair she was having, and told her she could not hide her sin from God. Wilson became obsessed with the idea that the billboard eyes of Dr TJ Eckleburg were the eyes of God, and he was convinced that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle was her lover.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Wilson tracks down the car, which leads him to Gatsby&rsquo;s mansion.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick then recounts Gatsby&rsquo;s last moments. He reflects that Gatsby&rsquo;s life must have become empty after he has lost his only dream. Finally, he shares the story of how Gatsby went to take a swim by himself, leaving instructions not to take the car out.Two shots are heard later on, and Nick, along with members of Gatsby&rsquo;s staff, discovers that George Wilson has shot and killed both Gatsby and himself. </span></p><h2 data-guid="68fbd296-50cb-49c7-a08e-462465174488" id="heading-9">Chapter IX</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Nick begins to tell the story of Gatsby&rsquo;s funeral. The house is swamped by police and members of the press and ridiculous rumors begin to be spread about Gatsby. Nick is organizing the funeral because no one feels seems interested in it, and he attempts to invite Gatsby's friends. However, he finds Tom and Daisy have moved away without leaving an address, and none of Gatsby's other former friends or business associates are interested in attending. Even Gatsby&rsquo;s closest business partner, Meyer Wolfshiem, refuses to come, despite Nick&rsquo;s insistent attempts to convince him. </span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In the end, the only people who attend the funeral are a few servants, Nick, and Gatsby's father, Henry Gatz. The man Nick met in Gatsby&rsquo;s library, &lsquo;Owl Eyes&rsquo;, also turns up eventually.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Henry Gatz has come from the Midwest, and tells Nick about Gatsby's childhood. He seems to be very proud of his son and his extensive wealth and possessions.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Nick decides to move away from Long Island and formally breaks off his relationship with Jordan Baker. He runs into Tom, who reveals that he was the one who told Wilson that Myrtle was killed by Gatsby's car, and he claims that Gatsby got what he deserved. Nick concludes that Daisy and Tom are both devoid of real human emotion and is disgusted.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The night before he leaves, Nick goes to Gatsby's mansion and contemplates Long Island as it must have been without any houses at all. He thinks about America as a place for dreamers and as a subject of dreams, much as Daisy was for Gatsby, while he looks towards the green light of the bay. He considers the sad fact that Gatsby was striving for a dream that was already empty when he began, and finally compares American dreamers to boats struggling against an overwhelming current.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../summary.html" title="Summary of The Great Gatsby" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a><a href="../analysis.html" title="The Great Gatsby Analysis" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Analysis</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The area is watched over by the large disembodied eyes of Dr T J Eckleburg, which stare down from an old billboard poster advertising the services of an optician. One day Tom takes Nick to the valley of ashes on their way in to New York, where they visit George Wilson\u0027s garage. It turns out that Tom is having an affair with George\u0027s wife Myrtle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTom takes Nick and Myrtle into New York, where he keeps an apartment in which to have his affair. Joined by Myrtle\u0027s sister and another couple called the McKees, they have a party which soon turns drunken and unpleasant. Nick is disgusted by the behavior of the guests and tries to leave, despite being very drunk himself, but he is somehow fascinated by their vulgarity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTom gives Myrtle a puppy as a gift, and Myrtle becomes increasingly outspoken.

Jordan and Nick meet a strange man wearing glasses in Gatsby\u0027s library whom Nick names \u0026ldquo;Owl Eyes\u0026rdquo;. They then start talking to a handsome young man on the terrace who turns out to be their host, Jay Gatsby.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNick describes Gatsby\u0026rsquo;s formal English accent and his habit of calling everyone \u0026ldquo;old sport\u0026rdquo;. He also notes how Gatsby does not really join the party, but seems content to watch his guests from the sidelines. Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and when she returns to Nick she claims to have\u0026nbsp;learned something amazing. The party breaks up and Nick returns home, walking past a place where a guest has drunkenly crashed his car.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNick then describes his daily life in order to give the reader a fuller picture of the events of the summer, explaining his routine of working and meeting women in New York City. Towards the middle of the summer, he meets up with Jordan Baker and gradually begins a romantic relationship with her, despite admitting to not actually being in love.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00225241005a-3f3f-479a-a503-41ee41c92d6d\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eChapter IV\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNick gives a list of some of the famous and fashionable people who attend Gatsby\u0027s parties. He then describes a trip to New York he took with Gatsby. While driving, Gatsby seems determined to tell Nick about his past, producing a dubious story about being the son of a wealthy Midwestern family and having been educated at Oxford. He claims that during the War he \u0026ldquo;tried very hard to die\u0026rdquo;, but somehow found his life was \u0026ldquo;enchanted\u0026rdquo; (p. 64).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eGatsby is stopped for speeding, but he is let off when he shows a card from a prominent police commissioner. At lunch, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a notorious gambler who is said to have fixed the 1919 World Series\u003c/span\u003e. Nick begins to suspect that Gatsby and his wealth may be linked to underground organized crime networks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eLater in the day, Nick meets Jordan Baker, who reveals what Gatsby told her in private at the party. She tells Nick that Gatsby is madly in love with Daisy. She explains how Daisy and Gatsby fell in love during the War, when he was stationed in her hometown. However, Daisy chose to marry Tom Buchanan instead whilst Gatsby was away, a choice of which her parents and peers approved. She was uncertain about her choice the night before her wedding, but decided to go through with it anyway. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eJordan says that Gatsby gained his enormous wealth in the hope of impressing Daisy and moved to West Egg to be near her.

He then goes to the garden and finds Gatsby, who seems desperate to please him. Nick tells Gatsby that he will arrange the meeting with Daisy; Gatsby is immensely grateful and offers to set Nick up in a business deal in return. Slightly offended, Nick declines the offer, but organizes the meeting anyway. He instructs Daisy not to bring Tom along for the visit. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe day of the meeting is rainy and Gatsby becomes very nervous, sending someone to cut Nick\u0027s lawn and filling his house with flowers. When Daisy arrives Gatsby is nowhere to be seen, but he soon arrives. The meeting between the pair is very awkward at first, but eventually Nick decides to leave them alone. When he returns, they have been fully reunited and both seem happy, though Daisy has tears in her eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eGatsby takes Nick and Daisy to his house to show off his possessions. Daisy finds his luxurious house and life wonderful and is overwhelmed with tears when he shows her his collection of beautiful shirts. Nick, however, wonders whether Daisy can live up to Gatsby\u0027s greatly romanticized image of her. He soon realizes that, their passion for each other rediscovered, they have forgotten he is there and he leaves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022066d9dee-5cf3-4f2f-9f35-d6df40abf001\u0022 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022\u003eChapter VI\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eA reporter comes to try and interview Gatsby at his house, fueled by increasingly wild rumors being spread about Gatsby in New York.

He started to attend college in Minnesota, but dropped out two weeks later, instead spending his time fishing on Lake Superior. One day, he went out in a rowing boat to the yacht of a rich industrialist, Dan Cody, to warn him about a coming storm. Grateful for the warning and intrigued by the young man\u0026rsquo;s confidence, Cody invited him to be his personal assistant and James Gatz reinvented himself as Jay Gatsby. When Cody died, he left Gatsby a large sum of money, but unfortunately Gatsby was not able to claim it, because Cody\u0026rsquo;s widow managed to secure everything for herself. Instead, Gatsby committed himself to becoming rich and powerful through his own means.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNick arrives at Gatsby\u0027s mansion one day to find Tom Buchanan visiting there.

Tom is insulting and Daisy is anxious, trying to defend Gatsby and the dubious source of his wealth. Gatsby is unhappy after the party ends, disappointed that Daisy did not enjoy herself. He wants everything to go back to how it was when they were young and in love, and believes he can achieve this with his wealth. Nick reflects that since Gatsby has been reunited with Daisy, the dream which has been urging Gatsby on in life is effectively over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022de62711a-7bf2-4300-8a6b-16a815fe4d02\u0022 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022\u003eChapter VII\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eGatsby makes the sudden decision to cancel his infamous parties and replaces all his servants, afraid his staff will spread gossip about him and Daisy.

Daisy\u0027s daughter is brought in, but Daisy seems uninterested in her child, while Gatsby can hardly believe her existence. The lunch party is very awkward, and a few looks and remarks exchanged by Gatsby and Daisy eventually convinces Tom that the pair are having an affair.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eEager to challenge Gatsby, Tom forces everyone to drive into town and take a suite at the Plaza Hotel.

Daisy is ultimately unwilling to reject Tom and admits her loyalty to him, and Tom tells Gatsby to drive Daisy back to East Egg.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eOn the return journey, Tom, Nick and Jordan discover that Myrtle, Tom\u0027s lover, has been hit by Gatsby\u0027s car and killed.

The man Nick met in Gatsby\u0026rsquo;s library, \u0026lsquo;Owl Eyes\u0026rsquo;, also turns up eventually.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eHenry Gatz has come from the Midwest, and tells Nick about Gatsby\u0027s childhood.

He runs into Tom, who reveals that he was the one who told Wilson that Myrtle was killed by Gatsby\u0027s car, and he claims that Gatsby got what he deserved. Nick concludes that Daisy and Tom are both devoid of real human emotion and is disgusted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe night before he leaves, Nick goes to Gatsby\u0027s mansion and contemplates Long Island as it must have been without any houses at all. He thinks about America as a place for dreamers and as a subject of dreams, much as Daisy was for Gatsby, while he looks towards the green light of the bay. He considers the sad fact that Gatsby was striving for a dream that was already empty when he began, and finally compares American dreamers to boats struggling against an overwhelming current.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Chapter summaries The Great Gatsby","MetaDescription":"The book opens with Nick Carraway, the novel\u0027s narrator, introducing himself.
