The narrative mainly presents the stay of American teenager and outsider Stanley Yelnats at Camp Green Lake, a reform school for delinquent youth in the Texas desert.</p><p>Stanley has been wrongly imprisoned for stealing sneakers and now is serving his sentence at Camp Green Lake: every day he has to dig a hole in the desert together with his fellow inmates. Through his clever and courageous efforts, Stanley manages to establish a friendship with one of the other youngsters. After their dangerous and adventurous escape from the camp, the story offers happy ending for both of them.</p><div class="onpagetoc"><span class="onpagetoc-header">Cuprins</span><ul><li><a href="#heading-2kie7" title="The curse of the Yelnats family">The curse of the Yelnats family</a></li><li><a href="#heading-u05yv" title="Camp Green Lake">Camp Green Lake</a></li><li><a href="#heading-w9dek" title="The life of the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow">The life of the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow</a></li><li><a href="#heading-zk7xw" title="Stanley banishes the family curse">Stanley banishes the family curse</a></li><li><a href="#heading-k2skn" title="Fate is merciful to the Yelnats">Fate is merciful to the Yelnats</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="heading-2kie7" data-guid="8df1e252-1570-4630-b8c5-68f687fdcaef">The curse of the Yelnats family</h2><p>Stanley's family has been under a curse for generations. The curse was brought upon them by Stanley&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather Elya Yelnats. Elya Yelnats grew up in Latvia, where he fell in love with the daughter of a farmer. However, her father did not want wanted his daughter to marry only someone who could provide him with the fattest pig for her. Since Elya came from a humble background, he asked his old friend Madame Zeroni for help.</p><p>Madame Zeroni told Elya he had to carry a piglet up the mountain every day for a year, while singing a specific song to it. In return, she demanded that he also carry her up the mountain at the end. If Elya forgot, a curse would be placed on his entire family for all eternity.</p><p>When Elya asked again for the farmer's daughter's hand in marriage, he quickly realized that he actually didn't want to marry her. He hastily emigrated to America - forgetting the promise he had made to Madame Zeroni. From that moment on, a curse was placed on the Yelnats family.</p><p>Stanley's great-grandfather, Stanley I, was the only one in the family to ever hit a brief winning streak again. He made a fortune on the American stock market - before it was stolen from him again by the famous outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow. Unlike many of her other victims, he was not killed by her but left in the desert. He managed to survive in the Texas desert for seventeen days because he found refuge on a mountain that he called the "Thumb of God".</p><p>The family misfortune is still felt even in the present. Stanley's father has worked for years as an imaginative but unsuccessful inventor. Despite countless attempts, he is unable to develop a recycling process for used sneakers. His son Stanley is affected even worse. He is sent to Camp Green Lake reform school for a theft he didn't even commit.</p><h2 id="heading-u05yv" data-guid="8f6c634e-c1b4-471b-8005-64ecec43d08f">Camp Green Lake</h2><p>On his way home from school one day, a pair of sneakers falls on Stanley's head out of nowhere. He is arrested shortly afterwards, and finds out that the sneakers belong to the famous baseball player Clyde Livingston and were stolen a few hours ago from a home for street children. No one wants to believe Stanley is innocent. He is convicted in a criminal trial and sent to Camp Green Lake reformatory for a period of eighteen months.</p><p>Camp Green Lake is a place located on a dry lake in the middle of the Texas desert. The conditions are harsh, the surroundings prison-like. Each of the delinquent youths must dig a deep hole on the dry lake every day. Only those who find something interesting can hope for a day off.</p><p>The Warden, Ms. Walker, is a brash, self-centered, and sadistic woman who is not interested in the boys' fate, but is well informed about everything that happens in the camp. She makes the youngsters dig holes not because she thinks this will improve their character, but because they might come across the lost treasure of the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow.</p><h2 id="heading-w9dek" data-guid="5173c8ad-5dd1-4f5c-b19e-d1a1f2856eec">The life of the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow</h2><p>The life of the notorious outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow is examined in more detail in a recurring narrative thread. Her real name was Katherine Barlow and she lived in the town of Green Lake 110 years ago. At that time, the area around what is now Camp Green Lake was not yet a desert, but a fertile landscape with a quiet little town. Katherine was a teacher at the local school and was universally popular, thanks in part to her good looks. Even the richest heir in town, Charles Walker, the grandfather of the future camp director, was interested in her. However, Katherine rejected him.</p><p>Katherine Barlow fell in love with Sam, an onion merchant who grew onions with healing powers in a secret place. The townspeople turned against her because Sam was African American. Therefore, their relationship was illegal in Texas at the time. The two are caught kissing and the townspeople want to hang Sam. Katherine and Sam try to escape. However, Sam I shot in the attempt.</p><p>Out of revenge against the townspeople and grief over the death of her lover, Katherine shot the town's sheriff, who had previously made her an outrageous offer. She called herself Kissin' Kate Barlow from then on and became the most feared outlaw in the American West.</p><p>When Katherine returned to Green Lake after twenty years, the town had already fallen into complete disrepair due to a prolonged drought. She buried her treasure in the desert and retired from the outlaw life. When her former and now ruined admirer Charles Walker, who had learned of the hidden treasure, tried to torture her until she told him the hiding place, Katherine was bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard and died. Charles and his family had to dig for the treasure for decades.&nbsp;</p><p>The Warden of the camp continues this unsuccessful search even in the present. She has the young people dig holes every day in the hope that one day they will find the treasure.</p><h2 id="heading-zk7xw" data-guid="96e6b7d7-4673-4b1a-9860-67be8c289508">Stanley banishes the family curse</h2><p>After only a few days at Camp Green Lake, Stanley accidentally comes across a golden tube engraved with the initials K.B. while digging. Stanley memorizes the correct location. There is a strictly regulated hierarchy among the boys of the camp. The leader of the group, X-Ray, claims every one of Stanley's finds as his own. When he passes off the golden tube as his own find, the Warden tells the boys to search for the treasure in the wrong hole.</p><p>The only boy in the camp with whom Stanley develops a close friendship is Zero, whose real name is Hector Zeroni and who is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches him how to read and write, and in return Zero digs a part of Stanley's hole every day. This leads to a violent argument with the other boys and a fight breaks out. Zero decides to flee into the desert. After a few days, Stanley follows his friend.</p><p>When the two meet in the desert, they are suffering from thirst and their only hope is the "Thumb of God," a rock formation on the edge of the desert with whose help Stanley's great-grandfather is said to have survived back then. Stanley and Zero manage to reach the mountain. As Stanley carries the exhausted Zero up the mountain, singing a song that has been passed down in his family, he unknowingly banishes the curse that has weighed on his family for generations. From there on, fate seems to be merciful to them: There is water on the mountain and even the amazingly nutritious onions of the late onion merchant Sam, with which the two can feed themselves.</p><h2 id="heading-k2skn" data-guid="d4fb280f-ad42-486e-8843-aac3c89de9c1">Fate is merciful to the Yelnats</h2><p>Stanley and Zero decide to return to Camp Green Lake to try to dig up Kissin' Kate Barlow's treasure by themselves. Just as they find a metal case, they are surrounded by the camp's Warden and her counselors. But fate is once again merciful to them. No one dares to take the suitcase from them because yellow-spotted lizards suddenly appear in the hole. Thanks to the onion juice in their blood, however, they do not bite Stanley and Zero, but for everyone else they are still deadly.</p><p>Before the Warden can devise another plan, Texas' top justice official and a lawyer hired by Stanley's parents show up. The lawyer has proven Stanley's innocence in court and has the authority to free him from Camp Green Lake. Since the files on Zero were all destroyed when he escaped into the desert, he too can be rescued by the lawyer.</p><p>On the very day Stanley carried Zero up the mountain, Stanley&rsquo;s father developed an effective remedy for foot sweat. He is so successful with it that even the famous baseball player Clyde Livingston advertises it. The metal suitcase labeled with Stanley's name that they discovered in the hole contained nearly two million dollars&rsquo; worth of jewelry and stocks, which Zero and Stanley split between them. They are both rich from now on. Camp Green Lake is closed after a thorough investigation. The Warden, Ms. Walker has to sell her&nbsp;land.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/louis-sachar/tabara/personaje/zero" title="Tabara de Louis Sachar | Caracterizarea lui Zero" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Zero</span></a></div></div></div></div>

The curse was brought upon them by Stanley\u0026rsquo;s great-great-grandfather Elya Yelnats. Elya Yelnats grew up in Latvia, where he fell in love with the daughter of a farmer. However, her father did not want wanted his daughter to marry only someone who could provide him with the fattest pig for her. Since Elya came from a humble background, he asked his old friend Madame Zeroni for help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMadame Zeroni told Elya he had to carry a piglet up the mountain every day for a year, while singing a specific song to it. In return, she demanded that he also carry her up the mountain at the end. If Elya forgot, a curse would be placed on his entire family for all eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Elya asked again for the farmer\u0027s daughter\u0027s hand in marriage, he quickly realized that he actually didn\u0027t want to marry her. He hastily emigrated to America - forgetting the promise he had made to Madame Zeroni. From that moment on, a curse was placed on the Yelnats family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStanley\u0027s great-grandfather, Stanley I, was the only one in the family to ever hit a brief winning streak again. He made a fortune on the American stock market - before it was stolen from him again by the famous outlaw Kissin\u0027 Kate Barlow. Unlike many of her other victims, he was not killed by her but left in the desert. He managed to survive in the Texas desert for seventeen days because he found refuge on a mountain that he called the \u0022Thumb of God\u0022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe family misfortune is still felt even in the present. Stanley\u0027s father has worked for years as an imaginative but unsuccessful inventor. Despite countless attempts, he is unable to develop a recycling process for used sneakers. His son Stanley is affected even worse. He is sent to Camp Green Lake reform school for a theft he didn\u0027t even commit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-u05yv\u0022 data-guid=\u00228f6c634e-c1b4-471b-8005-64ecec43d08f\u0022\u003eCamp Green Lake\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn his way home from school one day, a pair of sneakers falls on Stanley\u0027s head out of nowhere. He is arrested shortly afterwards, and finds out that the sneakers belong to the famous baseball player Clyde Livingston and were stolen a few hours ago from a home for street children. No one wants to believe Stanley is innocent. He is convicted in a criminal trial and sent to Camp Green Lake reformatory for a period of eighteen months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCamp Green Lake is a place located on a dry lake in the middle of the Texas desert. The conditions are harsh, the surroundings prison-like. Each of the delinquent youths must dig a deep hole on the dry lake every day. Only those who find something interesting can hope for a day off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Warden, Ms. Walker, is a brash, self-centered, and sadistic woman who is not interested in the boys\u0027 fate, but is well informed about everything that happens in the camp. She makes the youngsters dig holes not because she thinks this will improve their character, but because they might come across the lost treasure of the outlaw Kissin\u0027 Kate Barlow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-w9dek\u0022 data-guid=\u00225173c8ad-5dd1-4f5c-b19e-d1a1f2856eec\u0022\u003eThe life of the outlaw Kissin\u0027 Kate Barlow\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe life of the notorious outlaw Kissin\u0027 Kate Barlow is examined in more detail in a recurring narrative thread. Her real name was Katherine Barlow and she lived in the town of Green Lake 110 years ago. At that time, the area around what is now Camp Green Lake was not yet a desert, but a fertile landscape with a quiet little town. Katherine was a teacher at the local school and was universally popular, thanks in part to her good looks. Even the richest heir in town, Charles Walker, the grandfather of the future camp director, was interested in her. However, Katherine rejected him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKatherine Barlow fell in love with Sam, an onion merchant who grew onions with healing powers in a secret place. The townspeople turned against her because Sam was African American. Therefore, their relationship was illegal in Texas at the time. The two are caught kissing and the townspeople want to hang Sam. Katherine and Sam try to escape. However, Sam I shot in the attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOut of revenge against the townspeople and grief over the death of her lover, Katherine shot the town\u0027s sheriff, who had previously made her an outrageous offer. She called herself Kissin\u0027 Kate Barlow from then on and became the most feared outlaw in the American West.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Katherine returned to Green Lake after twenty years, the town had already fallen into complete disrepair due to a prolonged drought. She buried her treasure in the desert and retired from the outlaw life. When her former and now ruined admirer Charles Walker, who had learned of the hidden treasure, tried to torture her until she told him the hiding place, Katherine was bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard and died. Charles and his family had to dig for the treasure for decades.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Warden of the camp continues this unsuccessful search even in the present. She has the young people dig holes every day in the hope that one day they will find the treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-zk7xw\u0022 data-guid=\u002296e6b7d7-4673-4b1a-9860-67be8c289508\u0022\u003eStanley banishes the family curse\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter only a few days at Camp Green Lake, Stanley accidentally comes across a golden tube engraved with the initials K.B. while digging. Stanley memorizes the correct location. There is a strictly regulated hierarchy among the boys of the camp. The leader of the group, X-Ray, claims every one of Stanley\u0027s finds as his own. When he passes off the golden tube as his own find, the Warden tells the boys to search for the treasure in the wrong hole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only boy in the camp with whom Stanley develops a close friendship is Zero, whose real name is Hector Zeroni and who is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches him how to read and write, and in return Zero digs a part of Stanley\u0027s hole every day. This leads to a violent argument with the other boys and a fight breaks out. Zero decides to flee into the desert. After a few days, Stanley follows his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the two meet in the desert, they are suffering from thirst and their only hope is the \u0022Thumb of God,\u0022 a rock formation on the edge of the desert with whose help Stanley\u0027s great-grandfather is said to have survived back then. Stanley and Zero manage to reach the mountain. As Stanley carries the exhausted Zero up the mountain, singing a song that has been passed down in his family, he unknowingly banishes the curse that has weighed on his family for generations. From there on, fate seems to be merciful to them: There is water on the mountain and even the amazingly nutritious onions of the late onion merchant Sam, with which the two can feed themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-k2skn\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d4fb280f-ad42-486e-8843-aac3c89de9c1\u0022\u003eFate is merciful to the Yelnats\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eStanley and Zero decide to return to Camp Green Lake to try to dig up Kissin\u0027 Kate Barlow\u0027s treasure by themselves. Just as they find a metal case, they are surrounded by the camp\u0027s Warden and her counselors. But fate is once again merciful to them. No one dares to take the suitcase from them because yellow-spotted lizards suddenly appear in the hole. Thanks to the onion juice in their blood, however, they do not bite Stanley and Zero, but for everyone else they are still deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore the Warden can devise another plan, Texas\u0027 top justice official and a lawyer hired by Stanley\u0027s parents show up. The lawyer has proven Stanley\u0027s innocence in court and has the authority to free him from Camp Green Lake. Since the files on Zero were all destroyed when he escaped into the desert, he too can be rescued by the lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the very day Stanley carried Zero up the mountain, Stanley\u0026rsquo;s father developed an effective remedy for foot sweat. He is so successful with it that even the famous baseball player Clyde Livingston advertises it. The metal suitcase labeled with Stanley\u0027s name that they discovered in the hole contained nearly two million dollars\u0026rsquo; worth of jewelry and stocks, which Zero and Stanley split between them. They are both rich from now on. Camp Green Lake is closed after a thorough investigation. The Warden, Ms. Walker has to sell her\u0026nbsp;land.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Holes Summary","MetaDescription":"The young adult novel Holes by American author Louis Sachar was published in in 1998.
