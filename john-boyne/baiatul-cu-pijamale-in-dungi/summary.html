In 1943, his family moves to a new house near the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland because Bruno&rsquo;s father has been given a new job there. Adolf Hitler personally assigned him this job. The parents are very educated and are also careful with their children to teach them to be polite.</p><p>Bruno is shocked by the new house, as this place has nothing at all in common with his usual surroundings. From his window, he can see a camp surrounded by a fence. However, he has no idea what is happening there or who the people who live there are. When he shows Gretel this view, she is as irritated. .</p><p>Bruno tries in vain to convince his parents to move back to Berlin. He misses his friends and grandparents. He is also bored. He cannot play with Gretel either, because she often annoys Bruno and prefers to spend time with her dolls.&nbsp;</p><p>Gretel also finds it difficult to settle into the new place. However, she has a crush on the young Lieutenant Kotler, a close associate of her father. The two talk often. Bruno interrupts one of these conversations to ask Kotler for help, even though Bruno dislikes him.</p><p>Bruno would like to build himself a tire swing. Lieutenant Kotler orders the old Jewish camp inmate Pavel, who helps the family in the kitchen and serves them food, to get a suitable tire for Bruno.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Bruno and Gretel are shocked by the Lieutenant&rsquo;s rough treatment of Pavel. While swinging, Bruno falls and injures his leg. Pavel rushes to his help and takes care of his wounds. In the process, the two get to talking, and Bruno learns that Pavel is actually a doctor. Bruno does not believe him at first.</p><p>The relationship between Bruno&rsquo;s parents also deteriorates. The father is rarely at home, as he is always working in the camp. The mother takes over the upbringing of the children. She blames her husband and his ambition for their current situation. Bruno's mother becomes friends with Lieutenant Kotler and often talks to him.</p><p>Bruno remembers that his grandmother detested her son's career and political views. She liked to point out that she has Irish roots. Bruno's grandfather, on the other hand, was very proud of his son and supported him. Because of these disagreements, Bruno's grandmother eventually cut contact with the family almost completely.</p><p>Bruno's father hires Herr Liszt to teach Bruno and Gretel, as they otherwise cannot go to school. Herr Liszt mainly teaches the children the history of their country and the changes in Europe. In this way, he teaches Nazi ideas to the children.</p><p>Slowly, Bruno comes to terms with his new surroundings and begins to explore the area around the house. Bored, he walks along the fence and befriends a young inmate named Shmuel on the other side of the fence. The two meet regularly from then on.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruno keeps his visits to the fence a secret from his family. The long conversations between the two boys slowly make Bruno forget Berlin and his friends there. Bruno notices the similarities and differences between himself and Shmuel during the conversations, but he cannot understand or even explain them. Shmuel only hints at the injustice done to him in the camp and never says anything specific.</p><p>One day, Bruno&rsquo;s family receives a visit from &ldquo;the Fury&rdquo;, who Gretel explains is Germany&rsquo;s leader, and his companion Eva. While Bruno finds the Fury very rude and not particularly well-mannered, he is all the more impressed by Eva. She is nice and chats with him and his sister. The Fury and Eva have dinner together with Bruno's parents. Bruno and Gretel have to go to their rooms during this time.</p><p>Another evening, the whole family is having dinner with Lieutenant Kotler. Bruno, who is a good observer, notices that Pavel seems ill and weak. Kotler, meanwhile, tells him that he has had no contact with his father since he left Germany in the late 1930s. Bruno's father disapproves of Kotler's father's behavior and doubts his loyalty. This conversation is unpleasant for Kotler and makes him angry. When Pavel accidentally dumps a bottle of wine over Kotler's arm, Kotler can no longer control himself and takes out his frustration on Pavel. No one at the table holds him back or tries to help Pavel.</p><p>A few weeks pass , during which Bruno and Shmuel meet regularly. The family prepares to celebrate Bruno&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s birthday. When Bruno goes to the kitchen, he is surprised to find Shmuel there. He is polishing the family's glasses. Bruno gives Shmuel something to eat.&nbsp;</p><p>At that moment, Kotler enters the kitchen. When he accuses Shmuel of stealing the food, Shmuel replies that he received it from his friend Bruno. When asked by Kotler, Bruno denies his friendship with Shmuel out of fear and leaves the kitchen. A few days later, the two boys meet again, and Bruno apologizes. Shmuel forgives him.</p><p>After Bruno's grandmother dies, the family goes to Berlin for two days. Lieutenant Kotler is transferred from Auschwitz. This displeases both Bruno&rsquo;s mother and Gretel. Bruno's mother is increasingly lonely and begins to drink regularly, which Bruno thinks is for medical reasons. After some arguments between Bruno's parents, Bruno&rsquo;s father informs his children that they will move back to Berlin with their mother.</p><p>When Shmuel tells Bruno one day that he can no longer find his father in the camp, and Bruno tells Shmuel that he will return to Berlin with his mother and sister, the two make a plan. Shmuel gets Bruno prisoner clothes, which the latter describes only as pajamas. Bruno puts them on and crawls under the fence. Since his hair has been shaved off by his father due to a lice infestation, he now looks exactly like a camp inmate. After the two boys have searched in vain for Shmuel's father, they are herded into a room by soldiers together with other prisoners. There, the two boys die by gassing.</p><p>Bruno's parents search for him, but find only his clothes on the fence. The mother and Gretel return to Berlin. His father realizes what has happened to his son and no longer does his work properly. This leads to him being picked up by other soldiers and taken away from Auschwitz.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/john-boyne/baiatul-cu-pijamale-in-dungi/fisa-de-lectura" title="Baiatul cu pijamale in dungi de John Boyne | Fisa de lectura" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Fișă de lectură</span></a></div></div></div></div>

In 1943, his family moves to a new house near the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland because Bruno\u0026rsquo;s father has been given a new job there. Adolf Hitler personally assigned him this job. The parents are very educated and are also careful with their children to teach them to be polite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno is shocked by the new house, as this place has nothing at all in common with his usual surroundings. From his window, he can see a camp surrounded by a fence. However, he has no idea what is happening there or who the people who live there are. When he shows Gretel this view, she is as irritated. .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno tries in vain to convince his parents to move back to Berlin. He misses his friends and grandparents. He is also bored. He cannot play with Gretel either, because she often annoys Bruno and prefers to spend time with her dolls.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGretel also finds it difficult to settle into the new place. However, she has a crush on the young Lieutenant Kotler, a close associate of her father. The two talk often. Bruno interrupts one of these conversations to ask Kotler for help, even though Bruno dislikes him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno would like to build himself a tire swing. Lieutenant Kotler orders the old Jewish camp inmate Pavel, who helps the family in the kitchen and serves them food, to get a suitable tire for Bruno.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Bruno and Gretel are shocked by the Lieutenant\u0026rsquo;s rough treatment of Pavel. While swinging, Bruno falls and injures his leg. Pavel rushes to his help and takes care of his wounds. In the process, the two get to talking, and Bruno learns that Pavel is actually a doctor. Bruno does not believe him at first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between Bruno\u0026rsquo;s parents also deteriorates. The father is rarely at home, as he is always working in the camp. The mother takes over the upbringing of the children. She blames her husband and his ambition for their current situation. Bruno\u0027s mother becomes friends with Lieutenant Kotler and often talks to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno remembers that his grandmother detested her son\u0027s career and political views. She liked to point out that she has Irish roots. Bruno\u0027s grandfather, on the other hand, was very proud of his son and supported him. Because of these disagreements, Bruno\u0027s grandmother eventually cut contact with the family almost completely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno\u0027s father hires Herr Liszt to teach Bruno and Gretel, as they otherwise cannot go to school. Herr Liszt mainly teaches the children the history of their country and the changes in Europe. In this way, he teaches Nazi ideas to the children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Bruno comes to terms with his new surroundings and begins to explore the area around the house. Bored, he walks along the fence and befriends a young inmate named Shmuel on the other side of the fence. The two meet regularly from then on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno keeps his visits to the fence a secret from his family. The long conversations between the two boys slowly make Bruno forget Berlin and his friends there. Bruno notices the similarities and differences between himself and Shmuel during the conversations, but he cannot understand or even explain them. Shmuel only hints at the injustice done to him in the camp and never says anything specific.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne day, Bruno\u0026rsquo;s family receives a visit from \u0026ldquo;the Fury\u0026rdquo;, who Gretel explains is Germany\u0026rsquo;s leader, and his companion Eva. While Bruno finds the Fury very rude and not particularly well-mannered, he is all the more impressed by Eva. She is nice and chats with him and his sister. The Fury and Eva have dinner together with Bruno\u0027s parents. Bruno and Gretel have to go to their rooms during this time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother evening, the whole family is having dinner with Lieutenant Kotler. Bruno, who is a good observer, notices that Pavel seems ill and weak. Kotler, meanwhile, tells him that he has had no contact with his father since he left Germany in the late 1930s. Bruno\u0027s father disapproves of Kotler\u0027s father\u0027s behavior and doubts his loyalty. This conversation is unpleasant for Kotler and makes him angry. When Pavel accidentally dumps a bottle of wine over Kotler\u0027s arm, Kotler can no longer control himself and takes out his frustration on Pavel. No one at the table holds him back or tries to help Pavel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few weeks pass , during which Bruno and Shmuel meet regularly. The family prepares to celebrate Bruno\u0026rsquo;s father\u0026rsquo;s birthday. When Bruno goes to the kitchen, he is surprised to find Shmuel there. He is polishing the family\u0027s glasses. Bruno gives Shmuel something to eat.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Kotler enters the kitchen. When he accuses Shmuel of stealing the food, Shmuel replies that he received it from his friend Bruno. When asked by Kotler, Bruno denies his friendship with Shmuel out of fear and leaves the kitchen. A few days later, the two boys meet again, and Bruno apologizes. Shmuel forgives him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Bruno\u0027s grandmother dies, the family goes to Berlin for two days. Lieutenant Kotler is transferred from Auschwitz. This displeases both Bruno\u0026rsquo;s mother and Gretel. Bruno\u0027s mother is increasingly lonely and begins to drink regularly, which Bruno thinks is for medical reasons. After some arguments between Bruno\u0027s parents, Bruno\u0026rsquo;s father informs his children that they will move back to Berlin with their mother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Shmuel tells Bruno one day that he can no longer find his father in the camp, and Bruno tells Shmuel that he will return to Berlin with his mother and sister, the two make a plan. Shmuel gets Bruno prisoner clothes, which the latter describes only as pajamas. Bruno puts them on and crawls under the fence. Since his hair has been shaved off by his father due to a lice infestation, he now looks exactly like a camp inmate. After the two boys have searched in vain for Shmuel\u0027s father, they are herded into a room by soldiers together with other prisoners. There, the two boys die by gassing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBruno\u0027s parents search for him, but find only his clothes on the fence. The mother and Gretel return to Berlin. His father realizes what has happened to his son and no longer does his work properly. This leads to him being picked up by other soldiers and taken away from Auschwitz.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas | Summary","MetaDescription":"The novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by John Boyne tells the story of nine-year-old Bruno, who lives with his parents and older sister Gretel in Berlin during World War II.
