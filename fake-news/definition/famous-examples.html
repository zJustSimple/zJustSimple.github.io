Fake news often relates to political matters and is used particularly during events like presidential elections. Its purpose is to sway public opinion and to spread distrust. Next, you can read about some famous examples of fake news stories that have gained significant attention within the past decade.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="960ca63f-be02-4b86-9b5a-cc0bfa8229aa">Obama birther conspiracy</h2><p>Barack Obama, a member of the Democratic Party, ran a campaign for President in the 2008 elections in the United States against John McCain, the Republican candidate. During this time and throughout Obama&rsquo;s presidency, a number of conspiracy theories surfaced, <strong>claiming that he could not be President because he was not a natural-born citizen of the United States</strong> and he, therefore, did not meet the requirements set by the US Constitution.</p><p>Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, to a Kenyan father and an American mother. In 1967, Obama and his mother moved to Indonesia, but he later returned to Hawaii and has resided continuously in the United States since 1971.</p><p>These conspiracy theories had various claims about the birth place and citizenship of Barack Obama. <strong>Some of them alleged that Obama was, in fact, born in Kenya, not in Hawaii.</strong> Other theories alleged that Obama became a citizen of Indonesia and, as a result, lost his US citizenship. Another theory claimed that Obama was not a natural-born US citizen because he had dual citizenship.</p><p>In early 2008, fake news about Obama being born in Kenya began to circulate on <strong>conservative Republican websites</strong> and through <strong>chain emails</strong>, with the suggestion that this would disqualify him from the Presidency. A few months later, one conservative blogger stated that Obama should release his birth certificate to fight off these allegations.</p><p>In June 2008, officials of Obama&rsquo;s campaign did respond to the rumours by posting a scanned image of Obama&rsquo;s Certification of Live Birth, which was a shorter version of his birth certificate. However, the scan was not accepted by the conspiracy theorists who deemed that the image was manipulated content and that Obama should have posted his original birth certificate.</p><p>In August 2008, a lawsuit claiming that Obama was born in Kenya was brought against him, but the lawsuit was unsuccessful. In 2009, another lawsuit was filed and a <strong>forged birth certificate</strong> that allegedly belonged to Obama and proved he was born in Kenya was presented to the court as evidence. This case was dismissed as well.</p><p><strong>Many other examples of fabricated and manipulated content</strong> such as edited interviews, forged documents, and false testimonies were brought forward as evidence in mainstream media. The information was spread through chain e-mails, petitions, opinion surveys, articles, etc. Billboards, bumper stickers, and postcards featuring the slogan &ldquo;Where's the birth certificate?&rdquo; were also created and spread throughout the country.</p><p>In 2010, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&rsquo;s lawyer prompted an American tabloid to promote a potential presidential campaign for Donald Trump while also questioning the legitimacy of Barack Obama. Donald Trump also publicly declared that he was sceptical about Obama&rsquo;s citizenship and that Obama had something to hide. Later, during the 2016 elections when Trump ran for President, he repeated a false claim that Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the election, had started the controversy concerning Obama's place of birth. Although supporters of Hillary Clinton did spread fake news favouring the conspiracy theory at the time, there is no evidence that Clinton herself was involved.</p><p>In 2011, the White House finally made&nbsp;a certified copy of Obama&rsquo;s full and original birth certificate available to the public. The validity of the document was, however, met with opposition once more when a conservative website claimed that this document was also a forgery.</p><p>Although the theories about Obama's citizenship were evaluated and ultimately rejected, the topic became viral through the spread of fake news and it was hotly debated for over three years. It had <strong>a significant impact on both the Democratic and the Republican parties</strong> because it affected their credibility. Officials of Obama&rsquo;s campaign stated that the fake news was not really focused on the validity of the document and instead was trying to manipulate the American citizens. Other critics argued that these false claims were a racist reaction to Obama's status as the first African-American president of the United States.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="8c5ae669-46b6-41e2-ade4-1f261ab4dd93">Pizzagate conspiracy theory</h2><p>The Pizzagate conspiracy theory became a viral topic during the 2016 United States presidential elections, but it was ultimately proven as false. The name of the theory is a reference to another great political scandal, the Watergate scandal, which occurred in the United States in the early 1970s and led&nbsp;to Richard Nixon's resignation as President of the US.</p><p>The theory started to circulate in the fall of 2016&nbsp;when the personal e-mail account of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager was hacked and his e-mails were made public by the news leaks website WikiLeaks. Multiple <strong>alt-right websites and talk-radio stations in the United States started the conspiracy theory</strong> by alleging that the e-mails contained coded messages referring to human trafficking and child pornography. The conspirators connected the e-mails to prominent Democratic politicians, notably Hillary Clinton, and to a number of popular pizzerias and shops, which were said to provide cover for the alleged trafficking ring. Websites that supported Donald Trump, Clinton&rsquo;s opponent in the elections, created false articles that stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had confirmed the allegations.</p><p>The fake news quickly <strong>spread on</strong> <strong>social media platforms</strong> and was&nbsp;shared mainly by fake news websites and alt-right activists. Media analytics also stated that a large number of tweets and retweets about the Pizzagate conspiracy came from various countries in Europe and Asia and that <strong>most of them were generated by bots</strong>.</p><p>The pizzeria allegedly involved in the human trafficking ring, Comet Ping Pong, received numerous threats, including death threats, from the theory believers. The restaurant's owners and staff were harassed and threatened on social media websites, and images from their social media accounts were used alongside fake images as proof of their involvement in the scandal. On 4th of December, 2016, <strong>a shooting incident </strong>took place inside the pizzeria, but no one was injured. The shooting was carried out by a 28-year-old man who decided to investigate the conspiracy on his own and claimed that he was trying to save the children from the trafficking ring. Some conspiracy theorists speculated that the shooting was a staged attempt to discredit their investigations.</p><p><strong>Fact-checking websites</strong> proved that the Pizzagate conspiracy had no factual basis. The &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; provided was generally impostor content or images taken out of context. Hillary Clinton also commented on the topic, drawing attention to the real-life consequences fake news can have.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../definition.html" title="Definition of fake news" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Definition of fake news</span></a><a href="../social-media.html" title="Social media and fake news" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Social media and fake news</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Fake news often relates to political matters and is used particularly during events like presidential elections. Its purpose is to sway public opinion and to spread distrust. Next, you can read about some famous examples of fake news stories that have gained significant attention within the past decade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022960ca63f-be02-4b86-9b5a-cc0bfa8229aa\u0022\u003eObama birther conspiracy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarack Obama, a member of the Democratic Party, ran a campaign for President in the 2008 elections in the United States against John McCain, the Republican candidate. During this time and throughout Obama\u0026rsquo;s presidency, a number of conspiracy theories surfaced, \u003cstrong\u003eclaiming that he could not be President because he was not a natural-born citizen of the United States\u003c/strong\u003e and he, therefore, did not meet the requirements set by the US Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarack Obama was born in Hawaii, to a Kenyan father and an American mother. In 1967, Obama and his mother moved to Indonesia, but he later returned to Hawaii and has resided continuously in the United States since 1971.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese conspiracy theories had various claims about the birth place and citizenship of Barack Obama. \u003cstrong\u003eSome of them alleged that Obama was, in fact, born in Kenya, not in Hawaii.\u003c/strong\u003e Other theories alleged that Obama became a citizen of Indonesia and, as a result, lost his US citizenship. Another theory claimed that Obama was not a natural-born US citizen because he had dual citizenship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn early 2008, fake news about Obama being born in Kenya began to circulate on \u003cstrong\u003econservative Republican websites\u003c/strong\u003e and through \u003cstrong\u003echain emails\u003c/strong\u003e, with the suggestion that this would disqualify him from the Presidency. A few months later, one conservative blogger stated that Obama should release his birth certificate to fight off these allegations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June 2008, officials of Obama\u0026rsquo;s campaign did respond to the rumours by posting a scanned image of Obama\u0026rsquo;s Certification of Live Birth, which was a shorter version of his birth certificate. However, the scan was not accepted by the conspiracy theorists who deemed that the image was manipulated content and that Obama should have posted his original birth certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn August 2008, a lawsuit claiming that Obama was born in Kenya was brought against him, but the lawsuit was unsuccessful. In 2009, another lawsuit was filed and a \u003cstrong\u003eforged birth certificate\u003c/strong\u003e that allegedly belonged to Obama and proved he was born in Kenya was presented to the court as evidence. This case was dismissed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMany other examples of fabricated and manipulated content\u003c/strong\u003e such as edited interviews, forged documents, and false testimonies were brought forward as evidence in mainstream media. The information was spread through chain e-mails, petitions, opinion surveys, articles, etc. Billboards, bumper stickers, and postcards featuring the slogan \u0026ldquo;Where\u0027s the birth certificate?\u0026rdquo; were also created and spread throughout the country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2010, \u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026rsquo;s lawyer prompted an American tabloid to promote a potential presidential campaign for Donald Trump while also questioning the legitimacy of Barack Obama. Donald Trump also publicly declared that he was sceptical about Obama\u0026rsquo;s citizenship and that Obama had something to hide. Later, during the 2016 elections when Trump ran for President, he repeated a false claim that Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the election, had started the controversy concerning Obama\u0027s place of birth. Although supporters of Hillary Clinton did spread fake news favouring the conspiracy theory at the time, there is no evidence that Clinton herself was involved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, the White House finally made\u0026nbsp;a certified copy of Obama\u0026rsquo;s full and original birth certificate available to the public. The validity of the document was, however, met with opposition once more when a conservative website claimed that this document was also a forgery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the theories about Obama\u0027s citizenship were evaluated and ultimately rejected, the topic became viral through the spread of fake news and it was hotly debated for over three years. It had \u003cstrong\u003ea significant impact on both the Democratic and the Republican parties\u003c/strong\u003e because it affected their credibility. Officials of Obama\u0026rsquo;s campaign stated that the fake news was not really focused on the validity of the document and instead was trying to manipulate the American citizens. Other critics argued that these false claims were a racist reaction to Obama\u0027s status as the first African-American president of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00228c5ae669-46b6-41e2-ade4-1f261ab4dd93\u0022\u003ePizzagate conspiracy theory\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Pizzagate conspiracy theory became a viral topic during the 2016 United States presidential elections, but it was ultimately proven as false. The name of the theory is a reference to another great political scandal, the Watergate scandal, which occurred in the United States in the early 1970s and led\u0026nbsp;to Richard Nixon\u0027s resignation as President of the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe theory started to circulate in the fall of 2016\u0026nbsp;when the personal e-mail account of Hillary Clinton\u0027s campaign manager was hacked and his e-mails were made public by the news leaks website WikiLeaks. Multiple \u003cstrong\u003ealt-right websites and talk-radio stations in the United States started the conspiracy theory\u003c/strong\u003e by alleging that the e-mails contained coded messages referring to human trafficking and child pornography. The conspirators connected the e-mails to prominent Democratic politicians, notably Hillary Clinton, and to a number of popular pizzerias and shops, which were said to provide cover for the alleged trafficking ring. Websites that supported Donald Trump, Clinton\u0026rsquo;s opponent in the elections, created false articles that stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had confirmed the allegations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fake news quickly \u003cstrong\u003espread on\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003esocial media platforms\u003c/strong\u003e and was\u0026nbsp;shared mainly by fake news websites and alt-right activists. Media analytics also stated that a large number of tweets and retweets about the Pizzagate conspiracy came from various countries in Europe and Asia and that \u003cstrong\u003emost of them were generated by bots\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pizzeria allegedly involved in the human trafficking ring, Comet Ping Pong, received numerous threats, including death threats, from the theory believers. The restaurant\u0027s owners and staff were harassed and threatened on social media websites, and images from their social media accounts were used alongside fake images as proof of their involvement in the scandal. On 4th of December, 2016, \u003cstrong\u003ea shooting incident \u003c/strong\u003etook place inside the pizzeria, but no one was injured. The shooting was carried out by a 28-year-old man who decided to investigate the conspiracy on his own and claimed that he was trying to save the children from the trafficking ring. Some conspiracy theorists speculated that the shooting was a staged attempt to discredit their investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFact-checking websites\u003c/strong\u003e proved that the Pizzagate conspiracy had no factual basis. The \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo; provided was generally impostor content or images taken out of context. Hillary Clinton also commented on the topic, drawing attention to the real-life consequences fake news can have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Famous examples of fake news","MetaDescription":"In the 21st century, the impact and usage of the term “fake news” have become widespread.
