In itself, having ambition is often a positive human quality, but Shakespeare&rsquo;s play tells <strong>the story of a man whose lust for power ends up destroying him</strong>. Macbeth&rsquo;s ambition is kick-started by the witches&rsquo; prophecy in Act 1, Scene 3, but we get the impression that he has been thinking about becoming king before then; his many <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/analysis/language/devices">asides</a>&nbsp;in this scene show how quickly he starts playing with the idea of being king.</p><p>Macbeth&rsquo;s wife describes him as not being &ldquo;without ambition, but without/ The illness should attend it.&rdquo; (1.5.19-20). The fact that <strong>he is ambitious but fearful of the consequences of his actions </strong>makes him ill-suited to usurp the throne, and this is also partly why he is destroyed by it in the end.</p><p>Once Duncan has been killed and Macbeth&rsquo;s prophecy has come true, <strong>he expects the loyal Banquo to be equally ambitious</strong> about having his own prophecy come true. This is why Macbeth feels threatened by him and decides to have him killed as well. It also shows us how Macbeth&rsquo;s paranoia is increasing. As soon as he gets the crown, he realises that becoming king is not enough - he needs to remain king.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="408f8c4c-fca4-489a-94fc-37ed49f5585f">Fate versus Free will</h2><p><em>Macbeth </em>is heavily influenced by its Elizabethan context. Paradoxically, <strong>the Elizabethans believed in free will while also believing in destiny</strong>. Although superhuman forces controlled the universe, humans had been given free will and the gift of reason by God. It was then up to the individual to use his or her abilities the right way. As a tragic hero, Macbeth fails to do this. Partly because he is flawed, and partly because he is tricked by supernatural beings.</p><p><strong>This creates an interesting question about responsibility:</strong> is Macbeth&rsquo;s tragic end entirely his own fault, or was he manipulated into it by the witches and his wife? In connection with this, you may also consider how it affects the interpretation of the play whether we consider the supernatural elements &ndash; the floating dagger, Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, and to some extent the witches &ndash; to be real or not? If we think of these elements as real and not just figments of Macbeth&rsquo;s imagination, it takes away some of the responsibility from Macbeth.</p><p>You may also<strong> discuss which is the more powerful driver of the action in the play: </strong>is it the supernatural and fate, or is it Macbeth&rsquo;s ambition? In connection with this, it is an important point that<strong> Macbeth does not seem to trust fate</strong>. Although he initially says that &ldquo;chance may crown me,/ Without my stir&rdquo; (1.3.154-155), he soon decides to stop waiting and take matters into his own hands. In order to make the prophecy of becoming king true, he kills King Duncan himself. Later, he has Banquo murdered too because Banquo, according to the prophecy, poses a threat to Macbeth&rsquo;s royal line.</p><p>When Macbeth seeks out the witches and gets the second round of prophecies in Act 4, Scene 1, he still does not trust that fate will deliver. He is here told to be wary of Macduff and concludes: &ldquo;But yet I&rsquo;ll make assurance double sure,/ And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not life [Macduff].&rdquo; (4.1.91-92). However, as Macduff himself has fled, Macbeth has Macduff&rsquo;s family killed instead. This decision causes Macduff to swear revenge and to eventually kill Macbeth in Act 5, Scene 8.</p><p>You might argue that <strong>Macbeth is arrogant to think that he has the power to manipulate fate</strong>.</p><p>When discussing the theme of ambition, it would be a good idea to include the issue of hubris, which is so central to tragedies.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="dafab41e-3bbc-404a-9d32-84cd5ba833b1">Order versus Chaos or Natural versus Unnatural</h2><p>The contrasts mentioned in the title run throughout <em>Macbeth</em>. As mentioned in our <a target="" href="../background-information.html">Background information</a>, the Elizabethans believed that everything in the universe had its place in a fixed hierarchy called the Chain of Being. <strong>Disrupting this system of order would lead to chaos - an unnatural state </strong>- since everything in the universe was connected.</p><p>Right from the very first scene in <em>Macbeth</em> there is a sense of looming chaos as indicated by the unnatural presence of witches, a storm, and a battle. When Lady Macbeth orders evil spirits to remove her female characteristics in Act 1, Scene 5, our sense of something being unnatural and wrong increases. As King Duncan is murdered in Act 2, Scene 2, chaos finally breaks out for real; killing a king - <strong>regicide </strong>- was the worst possible crime in the Elizabethan world picture.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare uses the weather and nature to show how the universe is upset</strong> after Duncan&rsquo;s murder. For instance, the earth is shaking, Duncan&rsquo;s horses become wild, and daylight does not come (Act 2, Scenes 3-4). A state of chaos and unnaturalness is also signalled through <strong>the many references to disease</strong>. Doctors would typically examine a patient&rsquo;s urine to determine what was wrong with him, and Macbeth uses this image as he asks his doctor to &ldquo;cast/ The water of my land, find her disease.&rdquo; (5.3.58-59).</p><p>Another example of unnaturalness is that <em>Macbeth </em>is full of people whose bodies are not behaving naturally: <strong>unnatural bodies</strong>. For instance, the bleeding sergeant in Act 1, Scene 2 (blood should be inside the body) or Banquo&rsquo;s ghost that defies death. A character like Macbeth frequently informs us of how his body is rebelling against normality, such as when the mere thought of regicide makes Macbeth&rsquo;s heart beat wildly &ldquo;against the use of nature.&rdquo; (1.3.147).</p><p>Still curious? You can read more about signs of unnaturalness and chaos in our section on <a target="" href="../analysis/setting.html">physical setting</a>.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="85ee5745-3e16-48dd-85e5-3e65e7519216">Appearance versus Reality</h2><p><em>Macbeth </em>is a play which is full of lies, deceit, and surprise. <strong>Everyone is wearing a mask and hiding things from one another</strong>. Nothing is as it seems and <strong>being too trusting of others may be fatal</strong>, which the deaths of Duncan and Banquo demonstrate. The theme of deceit is introduced early, in Act 1, Scene 2 when we learn that one of Duncan&rsquo;s thanes, Cawdor, has rebelled against him. As Duncan later says: &ldquo;He was a gentleman on whom I built/ An absolute trust.&rdquo; (1.4.15-16).</p><p>Soon, the naive Duncan is equally deceived by Macbeth and his wife. Macbeth asks the stars to &ldquo;hide your fires;/ Let not light see my black and deep desires&rdquo; (1.4.57-58), and Lady Macbeth cunningly advises her husband to &ldquo;look like the innocent flower,/ But be the serpent under&rsquo;t.&rdquo; (1.5.73-74). However, soon Macbeth is the one who is fooled by the witches.</p><p><strong>The supernatural elements in the play also stress the theme of appearance versus reality</strong>. The prophecies from the witches are ambiguous, which makes Macbeth interpret them the wrong way. The witches&rsquo; physical appearance is hard to make out, too. Banquo does not know whether they are really women because they look so unappealing and have beards like men (1.3.40-48).</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="286006ea-774d-416e-b88e-9dc8b86680f3">Masculinity versus Femininity</h2><p><em>Macbeth </em>was written in Elizabethan England, which was a deeply patriarchal society. However, Shakespeare often plays with ideas of gender roles in his plays, and you could argue that gender is a central theme in <em>Macbeth</em>. <strong>The role of women is particularly interesting in relation to the question of responsibility:</strong> who do we blame for the downfall of our tragic hero? Macbeth is a very ambitious man, but his ambition is encouraged by the witches and his wife: <strong>Macbeth&rsquo;s catalysts are all female</strong>. In this play, Shakespeare seems to portray women as evil creatures who lead men into temptation, possibly because they cannot control their own evil natures and passions.</p><p>This interpretation would at least fit the general <strong>view of women in Elizabethan England</strong> where women were expected to remain passive, submissive, and feminine for the sake of everybody. It would also fit the traditional view of women found in the Bible where Eve - the mother of all women - is cast as a sinner who leads Adam into ruin. The Elizabethan world view was highly influenced by Christianity.</p><p>Some interpretations even <strong>associate Lady Macbeth with the supernatural</strong>. This is partly because she refers to the witches in a positive way as &ldquo;metaphysical aid&rdquo; (1.5.29), and partly because she addresses evil spirits, again without signs of fear.</p><p>Another element which appears to support this negative view of women is <strong>the way Lady Macbeth and Lady Macduff are portrayed</strong>. When we meet her in Act 4, Scene 2, Lady Macduff seems like the stereotypical woman who is silly and almost hysterical because her husband has fled to England without her: she seems incapable of acting without him. The patriarchal Elizabeth world view would see this female dependency on a husband as something natural.</p><p>This is a clear contrast to when we first met Lady Macbeth in Act 1, Scene 5: Macbeth&rsquo;s wife comes off as strong and determined. She goes even further and asks evil spirits to &ldquo;unsex&rdquo; her, essentially asking for her feminine, soft traits to be exchanged with masculine, strong ones instead. Lady Macbeth goes against the stereotypical view of women as soft and dependent, and she would have seemed unnatural and potentially frightening to many Elizabethans.</p><p>Of course, the question is whether Shakespeare really wants us to hate Lady Macbeth? You might argue that she has the courage of a warrior, which is undoubtedly a positive quality, and she is &ndash; to some extent &ndash; morally redeemed towards the end when she starts sleepwalking and kills herself out of guilt. She dies a lonely death, and it is hard not to pity her.</p><p>No matter how you chose to interpret the portrayal of femininity in <em>Macbeth</em>,<strong> the play certainly centres around the theme of masculinity</strong> &ndash; and the question of what makes a man. In particular, Lady Macbeth mocks her husband for not acting like a man, for instance when he thinks he sees Banquo&rsquo;s ghost: &ldquo;What, quite unmann&rsquo;d in folly?&rdquo; (3.4.85). Macbeth himself is aware of the traditional view of masculine behaviour when he says after the disappearance of Banquo&rsquo;s frightening, unnatural ghost: &ldquo;I am a man again.&rdquo; (3.4.126).</p><p>You may want to discuss this yourself; what makes a man a man, and what makes a woman a woman?</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../interpretation.html" title="Interpretation of Macbeth" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Interpretation</span></a><a href="symbols.html" title="Symbols in Macbeth" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Symbols</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

In itself, having ambition is often a positive human quality, but Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s play tells \u003cstrong\u003ethe story of a man whose lust for power ends up destroying him\u003c/strong\u003e. Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s ambition is kick-started by the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy in Act 1, Scene 3, but we get the impression that he has been thinking about becoming king before then; his many \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/analysis/language/devices\u0022\u003easides\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;in this scene show how quickly he starts playing with the idea of being king.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMacbeth\u0026rsquo;s wife describes him as not being \u0026ldquo;without ambition, but without/ The illness should attend it.\u0026rdquo; (1.5.19-20). The fact that \u003cstrong\u003ehe is ambitious but fearful of the consequences of his actions \u003c/strong\u003emakes him ill-suited to usurp the throne, and this is also partly why he is destroyed by it in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce Duncan has been killed and Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s prophecy has come true, \u003cstrong\u003ehe expects the loyal Banquo to be equally ambitious\u003c/strong\u003e about having his own prophecy come true. This is why Macbeth feels threatened by him and decides to have him killed as well. It also shows us how Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s paranoia is increasing. As soon as he gets the crown, he realises that becoming king is not enough - he needs to remain king.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022408f8c4c-fca4-489a-94fc-37ed49f5585f\u0022\u003eFate versus Free will\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003eis heavily influenced by its Elizabethan context. Paradoxically, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Elizabethans believed in free will while also believing in destiny\u003c/strong\u003e. Although superhuman forces controlled the universe, humans had been given free will and the gift of reason by God. It was then up to the individual to use his or her abilities the right way. As a tragic hero, Macbeth fails to do this. Partly because he is flawed, and partly because he is tricked by supernatural beings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis creates an interesting question about responsibility:\u003c/strong\u003e is Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s tragic end entirely his own fault, or was he manipulated into it by the witches and his wife? In connection with this, you may also consider how it affects the interpretation of the play whether we consider the supernatural elements \u0026ndash; the floating dagger, Banquo\u0026rsquo;s ghost, and to some extent the witches \u0026ndash; to be real or not? If we think of these elements as real and not just figments of Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s imagination, it takes away some of the responsibility from Macbeth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may also\u003cstrong\u003e discuss which is the more powerful driver of the action in the play: \u003c/strong\u003eis it the supernatural and fate, or is it Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s ambition? In connection with this, it is an important point that\u003cstrong\u003e Macbeth does not seem to trust fate\u003c/strong\u003e. Although he initially says that \u0026ldquo;chance may crown me,/ Without my stir\u0026rdquo; (1.3.154-155), he soon decides to stop waiting and take matters into his own hands. In order to make the prophecy of becoming king true, he kills King Duncan himself. Later, he has Banquo murdered too because Banquo, according to the prophecy, poses a threat to Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s royal line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Macbeth seeks out the witches and gets the second round of prophecies in Act 4, Scene 1, he still does not trust that fate will deliver. He is here told to be wary of Macduff and concludes: \u0026ldquo;But yet I\u0026rsquo;ll make assurance double sure,/ And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not life [Macduff].\u0026rdquo; (4.1.91-92). However, as Macduff himself has fled, Macbeth has Macduff\u0026rsquo;s family killed instead. This decision causes Macduff to swear revenge and to eventually kill Macbeth in Act 5, Scene 8.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might argue that \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth is arrogant to think that he has the power to manipulate fate\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen discussing the theme of ambition, it would be a good idea to include the issue of hubris, which is so central to tragedies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022dafab41e-3bbc-404a-9d32-84cd5ba833b1\u0022\u003eOrder versus Chaos or Natural versus Unnatural\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe contrasts mentioned in the title run throughout \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e. As mentioned in our \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/macbeth/background-information\u0022\u003eBackground information\u003c/a\u003e, the Elizabethans believed that everything in the universe had its place in a fixed hierarchy called the Chain of Being. \u003cstrong\u003eDisrupting this system of order would lead to chaos - an unnatural state \u003c/strong\u003e- since everything in the universe was connected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight from the very first scene in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e there is a sense of looming chaos as indicated by the unnatural presence of witches, a storm, and a battle. When Lady Macbeth orders evil spirits to remove her female characteristics in Act 1, Scene 5, our sense of something being unnatural and wrong increases. As King Duncan is murdered in Act 2, Scene 2, chaos finally breaks out for real; killing a king - \u003cstrong\u003eregicide \u003c/strong\u003e- was the worst possible crime in the Elizabethan world picture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShakespeare uses the weather and nature to show how the universe is upset\u003c/strong\u003e after Duncan\u0026rsquo;s murder. For instance, the earth is shaking, Duncan\u0026rsquo;s horses become wild, and daylight does not come (Act 2, Scenes 3-4). A state of chaos and unnaturalness is also signalled through \u003cstrong\u003ethe many references to disease\u003c/strong\u003e. Doctors would typically examine a patient\u0026rsquo;s urine to determine what was wrong with him, and Macbeth uses this image as he asks his doctor to \u0026ldquo;cast/ The water of my land, find her disease.\u0026rdquo; (5.3.58-59).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example of unnaturalness is that \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003eis full of people whose bodies are not behaving naturally: \u003cstrong\u003eunnatural bodies\u003c/strong\u003e. For instance, the bleeding sergeant in Act 1, Scene 2 (blood should be inside the body) or Banquo\u0026rsquo;s ghost that defies death. A character like Macbeth frequently informs us of how his body is rebelling against normality, such as when the mere thought of regicide makes Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s heart beat wildly \u0026ldquo;against the use of nature.\u0026rdquo; (1.3.147).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill curious? You can read more about signs of unnaturalness and chaos in our section on \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/macbeth/analysis/setting\u0022\u003ephysical setting\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u002285ee5745-3e16-48dd-85e5-3e65e7519216\u0022\u003eAppearance versus Reality\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003eis a play which is full of lies, deceit, and surprise. \u003cstrong\u003eEveryone is wearing a mask and hiding things from one another\u003c/strong\u003e. Nothing is as it seems and \u003cstrong\u003ebeing too trusting of others may be fatal\u003c/strong\u003e, which the deaths of Duncan and Banquo demonstrate. The theme of deceit is introduced early, in Act 1, Scene 2 when we learn that one of Duncan\u0026rsquo;s thanes, Cawdor, has rebelled against him. As Duncan later says: \u0026ldquo;He was a gentleman on whom I built/ An absolute trust.\u0026rdquo; (1.4.15-16).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoon, the naive Duncan is equally deceived by Macbeth and his wife. Macbeth asks the stars to \u0026ldquo;hide your fires;/ Let not light see my black and deep desires\u0026rdquo; (1.4.57-58), and Lady Macbeth cunningly advises her husband to \u0026ldquo;look like the innocent flower,/ But be the serpent under\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; (1.5.73-74). However, soon Macbeth is the one who is fooled by the witches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe supernatural elements in the play also stress the theme of appearance versus reality\u003c/strong\u003e. The prophecies from the witches are ambiguous, which makes Macbeth interpret them the wrong way. The witches\u0026rsquo; physical appearance is hard to make out, too. Banquo does not know whether they are really women because they look so unappealing and have beards like men (1.3.40-48).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022286006ea-774d-416e-b88e-9dc8b86680f3\u0022\u003eMasculinity versus Femininity\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003ewas written in Elizabethan England, which was a deeply patriarchal society. However, Shakespeare often plays with ideas of gender roles in his plays, and you could argue that gender is a central theme in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eThe role of women is particularly interesting in relation to the question of responsibility:\u003c/strong\u003e who do we blame for the downfall of our tragic hero? Macbeth is a very ambitious man, but his ambition is encouraged by the witches and his wife: \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth\u0026rsquo;s catalysts are all female\u003c/strong\u003e. In this play, Shakespeare seems to portray women as evil creatures who lead men into temptation, possibly because they cannot control their own evil natures and passions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis interpretation would at least fit the general \u003cstrong\u003eview of women in Elizabethan England\u003c/strong\u003e where women were expected to remain passive, submissive, and feminine for the sake of everybody. It would also fit the traditional view of women found in the Bible where Eve - the mother of all women - is cast as a sinner who leads Adam into ruin. The Elizabethan world view was highly influenced by Christianity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome interpretations even \u003cstrong\u003eassociate Lady Macbeth with the supernatural\u003c/strong\u003e. This is partly because she refers to the witches in a positive way as \u0026ldquo;metaphysical aid\u0026rdquo; (1.5.29), and partly because she addresses evil spirits, again without signs of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother element which appears to support this negative view of women is \u003cstrong\u003ethe way Lady Macbeth and Lady Macduff are portrayed\u003c/strong\u003e. When we meet her in Act 4, Scene 2, Lady Macduff seems like the stereotypical woman who is silly and almost hysterical because her husband has fled to England without her: she seems incapable of acting without him. The patriarchal Elizabeth world view would see this female dependency on a husband as something natural.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a clear contrast to when we first met Lady Macbeth in Act 1, Scene 5: Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s wife comes off as strong and determined. She goes even further and asks evil spirits to \u0026ldquo;unsex\u0026rdquo; her, essentially asking for her feminine, soft traits to be exchanged with masculine, strong ones instead. Lady Macbeth goes against the stereotypical view of women as soft and dependent, and she would have seemed unnatural and potentially frightening to many Elizabethans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, the question is whether Shakespeare really wants us to hate Lady Macbeth? You might argue that she has the courage of a warrior, which is undoubtedly a positive quality, and she is \u0026ndash; to some extent \u0026ndash; morally redeemed towards the end when she starts sleepwalking and kills herself out of guilt. She dies a lonely death, and it is hard not to pity her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo matter how you chose to interpret the portrayal of femininity in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e the play certainly centres around the theme of masculinity\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; and the question of what makes a man. In particular, Lady Macbeth mocks her husband for not acting like a man, for instance when he thinks he sees Banquo\u0026rsquo;s ghost: \u0026ldquo;What, quite unmann\u0026rsquo;d in folly?\u0026rdquo; (3.4.85). Macbeth himself is aware of the traditional view of masculine behaviour when he says after the disappearance of Banquo\u0026rsquo;s frightening, unnatural ghost: \u0026ldquo;I am a man again.\u0026rdquo; (3.4.126).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may want to discuss this yourself; what makes a man a man, and what makes a woman a woman?\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Themes in Macbeth","MetaDescription":"One of the major themes of Macbeth is ambition.
