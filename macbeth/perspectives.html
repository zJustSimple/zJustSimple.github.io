King James I was England&rsquo;s ruler as well as the financial supporter of Shakespeare&rsquo;s acting company. James, who was Scottish, had taken over in 1603 after his relative Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603), whose long reign is now referred to as <strong>the Elizabethan era</strong>. The Queen had supported the development of English poetry and drama as well as English exploration abroad.</p><p>However, it was still a rather conservative time. <strong>The role of women</strong> in particular was very different from what it is today: women were generally expected to be submissive and virtuous, and female actors were not allowed, which is why all female roles in <em>Macbeth </em>would have been played by young boys. Many Elizabethans were also superstitious and believed in witchcraft.</p><p>The Elizabethan era existed within the wider European historical period called <strong>the Renaissance</strong> and was naturally influenced by it. The period marked a break with the so-called &ldquo;dark&rdquo; Middle Ages which came before. Renaissance means &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; and was inspired by classical ideas from Ancient Rome and Greece, particularly in art, philosophy and literature. We see this inspiration in <em>Macbeth</em> in the classical five-act structure of the play ending with the downfall of the tragic hero.</p><p>In the play, we also see<strong> the Elizabethan world picture</strong>, which was generally a mixture of older medieval ideas and more modern Renaissance ideas. Paradoxically, the Elizabethans believed that humans were unique creature who had been given free will by God while also being influenced by fate. Everyone was thought to be part of a universal hierarchy called the Chain of Being which kept everything in perfect balance - unless it was disturbed, which is exactly what happens in <em>Macbeth</em>. We advise you to check out our <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/background-information">Background information</a>&nbsp;section for a detailed understanding of the historical context of <em>Macbeth</em>.</p><h2 data-guid="a1ac97fe-ceb1-448c-b410-28061ccf1712" id="heading-2">Literary perspective</h2><p>English literature in the Elizabethan era was<strong> influenced by classical European literature</strong>, such as the tragedies of Ancient Greek writers like Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides, but also went through great developments. New authors like William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson explored what literature could do, just like adventurers such as Sir Francis Drake explored the boundaries of the world itself on his many sea voyages.</p><p>It is generally believed that Shakespeare received a thorough education in classical literature as a boy; his plays certainly show inspiration from ancient drama. <em>Macbeth </em>follows the classical plot structure by being a five-act tragedy, and by being about a tragic hero who brings on his own downfall because he is flawed but fails to see it.</p><p>However, Shakespeare did not stick to ancient conventions but <strong>liked to be creative</strong>. Macbeth is unique for being a round, psychologically well-developed character which brings a sense of <strong>realism</strong> to the drama genre. <strong>Language </strong>is another area where Shakespeare broke new ground; he frequently invented new words, and many common phrases of modern English come from his plays.</p><p>Shakespeare also knew how to make his plays appealing to educated people as well as commoners, which was probably part of the reason why <strong>play-going became a favourite activity for almost everyone</strong> during the Elizabethan era. Another common feature in Elizabethan drama was <strong>propaganda</strong> meant to glorify people of influence. For instance, <em>Macbeth </em>hails King James I and his claim to the English throne.</p><p>Originally, <strong>plays were performed outdoors</strong> in the courtyards of inns, but from 1576 they started being performed at purpose-made theatres, although still out of doors. If you have ever visited the reconstructed Globe Theatre in London, you will know that acting took place inside a round building without any roof or artificial lighting.</p><p>As a contrast to today, <strong>theatre was considered immoral </strong>by many during the Elizabethan era, especially the group of Protestants called the Puritans. You may read more about the nature of Elizabethan theatre in our Background information.</p><h2 data-guid="36e1ba5d-9e9c-49bf-8e6c-eff9b0d07b4e" id="heading-3">Textual perspective</h2><h3>Fiction</h3><p><strong><em>House of Cards </em>&nbsp;by Beau Willimon</strong></p><p>If you would like to compare <em>Macbeth </em>to something modern, the American TV series <em>House of Cards</em>&nbsp;(2013 and onwards) is a good choice. It stars Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as Claire Underwood. There are <strong>numerous parallels between the characters and themes</strong> of the series and Shakespeare&rsquo;s play from 1606. In the beginning of the TV series, Frank and Claire Underwood are portrayed as a united power couple, just like the Macbeths.</p><p>Both Claire Underwood and Lady Macbeth cunningly support and encourage their husbands&rsquo; quest for political power, and they have no children. Frank Underwood and Macbeth are similar in their unrelenting lust for power which drives them into evil actions. The fairly naive character of Peter Russo in <em>House of Cards </em>is often compared to Banquo, and the young reporter Zoe Barnes and two of her fellow reporters are sometimes compared to the three witches since they are knowledgeable and outside of the established order, just like the witches of <em>Macbeth</em>.</p><p>Interestingly, Frank Underwood often <strong>addresses the viewers directly</strong> which mirrors Macbeth&rsquo;s many asides. This gives us an insight into what drives them, but it also makes them likable villains.</p><p>The overall <strong>theme</strong> in both the series and the play is ambition and its consequences.</p><p><strong><em>Hamlet </em>by William Shakespeare</strong></p><p><em>Hamlet</em>&nbsp;(probably written somewhere between 1599 and 1602) is another of Shakespeare&rsquo;s famous tragedies, and if you wish to go all in on Shakespeare analysis, there are many elements you could compare in the two plays. Both of the tragic heroes, Hamlet and Macbeth, are <strong>influenced by the supernatural </strong>right from the start: Hamlet meets the ghost of his father, and Macbeth meets the three witches. They both receive vital information during this meeting that propels them towards their downfall. However, whereas Hamlet tends to overthink everything, Macbeth soon decides to act before thinking. All of this allows for a discussion of responsibility; do we blame the supernatural powers or the tragic heroes themselves for their downfall?</p><p><strong>The role of women</strong> in the two plays is very interesting, too. You might say that neither play portrays women in a very positive light. In <em>Hamlet</em>, Hamlet&rsquo;s mother Gertrude happily marries her murdered husband&rsquo;s brother Claudius and thus keeps her position as queen, and in <em>Macbeth</em>, Lady Macbeth has no scruples encouraging her husband to kill the king, making her queen.</p><p>However, both women die during their husband&rsquo;s reign as king. (The same goes for Hamlet&rsquo;s sweetheart Ophelia who appears to go mad and kill herself in the wake of her lover&rsquo;s quest for power, just like Lady Macbeth). Analytically, you might discuss these women&rsquo;s level of ambition and how much responsibility we may place on them when it comes to the downfall of the tragic hero.</p><p>The two plays share many <strong>themes</strong>. For instance: appearance versus reality, identity, or revenge and justice.</p><h3>Non-fiction</h3><p>If you are fascinated with Lady Macbeth and want to <strong>examine the theme of femininity and power </strong>in Macbeth, you might want to compare Shakespeare&rsquo;s play to the article <strong>"Why I Picked Up a Gun" by Tiffany Hyatt</strong>. In it, a single mother of four explains why she decided to carry a gun and train herself in handling it after having been raped and beaten. She has now become an advocate for women carrying guns for self-defence and believes that modern women ought to rediscover the self-reliant spirit which American women of the past displayed; she argues they often defended their homes and family as well as the men did. Her attitude and determination resembles that of Lady Macbeth who also decides to be a go-getter and remove all threats, although you might argue that she uses her husband as a weapon instead of wielding one herself.</p><p>If you want to <strong>examine the theme of masculinity and femininity</strong> in Macbeth, you might want to compare Shakespeare&rsquo;s play to the article <strong>"Trump is a Climax of American Masculinity" by James Hamblin</strong>. The writer argues that Donald Trump represents stereotypical masculinity, which appeals to his main supporters - white men without a degree - since these supporters feel that their own masculinity is threatened. Examples of this archetypical behaviour are that Trump shouts at people, refuses to apologise, rarely smiles, and openly prefers beautiful young women. Although his behaviour and statements frequently cause outrage, he is successful. In Macbeth, Macbeth frequently argues with his wife about what makes a man masculine, and Lady Macbeth herself challenges gender conventions with her &ldquo;unsex me&rdquo; soliloquy and dominant behaviour.

King James I was England\u0026rsquo;s ruler as well as the financial supporter of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s acting company. James, who was Scottish, had taken over in 1603 after his relative Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603), whose long reign is now referred to as \u003cstrong\u003ethe Elizabethan era\u003c/strong\u003e. The Queen had supported the development of English poetry and drama as well as English exploration abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was still a rather conservative time. \u003cstrong\u003eThe role of women\u003c/strong\u003e in particular was very different from what it is today: women were generally expected to be submissive and virtuous, and female actors were not allowed, which is why all female roles in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003ewould have been played by young boys. Many Elizabethans were also superstitious and believed in witchcraft.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Elizabethan era existed within the wider European historical period called \u003cstrong\u003ethe Renaissance\u003c/strong\u003e and was naturally influenced by it. The period marked a break with the so-called \u0026ldquo;dark\u0026rdquo; Middle Ages which came before. Renaissance means \u0026ldquo;rebirth\u0026rdquo; and was inspired by classical ideas from Ancient Rome and Greece, particularly in art, philosophy and literature. We see this inspiration in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e in the classical five-act structure of the play ending with the downfall of the tragic hero.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the play, we also see\u003cstrong\u003e the Elizabethan world picture\u003c/strong\u003e, which was generally a mixture of older medieval ideas and more modern Renaissance ideas. Paradoxically, the Elizabethans believed that humans were unique creature who had been given free will by God while also being influenced by fate. Everyone was thought to be part of a universal hierarchy called the Chain of Being which kept everything in perfect balance - unless it was disturbed, which is exactly what happens in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e.

New authors like William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson explored what literature could do, just like adventurers such as Sir Francis Drake explored the boundaries of the world itself on his many sea voyages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is generally believed that Shakespeare received a thorough education in classical literature as a boy; his plays certainly show inspiration from ancient drama. \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003efollows the classical plot structure by being a five-act tragedy, and by being about a tragic hero who brings on his own downfall because he is flawed but fails to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Shakespeare did not stick to ancient conventions but \u003cstrong\u003eliked to be creative\u003c/strong\u003e. Macbeth is unique for being a round, psychologically well-developed character which brings a sense of \u003cstrong\u003erealism\u003c/strong\u003e to the drama genre. \u003cstrong\u003eLanguage \u003c/strong\u003eis another area where Shakespeare broke new ground; he frequently invented new words, and many common phrases of modern English come from his plays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShakespeare also knew how to make his plays appealing to educated people as well as commoners, which was probably part of the reason why \u003cstrong\u003eplay-going became a favourite activity for almost everyone\u003c/strong\u003e during the Elizabethan era. Another common feature in Elizabethan drama was \u003cstrong\u003epropaganda\u003c/strong\u003e meant to glorify people of influence. For instance, \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003ehails King James I and his claim to the English throne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginally, \u003cstrong\u003eplays were performed outdoors\u003c/strong\u003e in the courtyards of inns, but from 1576 they started being performed at purpose-made theatres, although still out of doors. If you have ever visited the reconstructed Globe Theatre in London, you will know that acting took place inside a round building without any roof or artificial lighting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a contrast to today, \u003cstrong\u003etheatre was considered immoral \u003c/strong\u003eby many during the Elizabethan era, especially the group of Protestants called the Puritans. You may read more about the nature of Elizabethan theatre in our Background information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002236e1ba5d-9e9c-49bf-8e6c-eff9b0d07b4e\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eTextual perspective\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFiction\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards \u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;by Beau Willimon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you would like to compare \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003eto something modern, the American TV series \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(2013 and onwards) is a good choice. It stars Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as Claire Underwood. There are \u003cstrong\u003enumerous parallels between the characters and themes\u003c/strong\u003e of the series and Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s play from 1606. In the beginning of the TV series, Frank and Claire Underwood are portrayed as a united power couple, just like the Macbeths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Claire Underwood and Lady Macbeth cunningly support and encourage their husbands\u0026rsquo; quest for political power, and they have no children. Frank Underwood and Macbeth are similar in their unrelenting lust for power which drives them into evil actions. The fairly naive character of Peter Russo in \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards \u003c/em\u003eis often compared to Banquo, and the young reporter Zoe Barnes and two of her fellow reporters are sometimes compared to the three witches since they are knowledgeable and outside of the established order, just like the witches of \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, Frank Underwood often \u003cstrong\u003eaddresses the viewers directly\u003c/strong\u003e which mirrors Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s many asides. This gives us an insight into what drives them, but it also makes them likable villains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe overall \u003cstrong\u003etheme\u003c/strong\u003e in both the series and the play is ambition and its consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHamlet \u003c/em\u003eby William Shakespeare\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHamlet\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(probably written somewhere between 1599 and 1602) is another of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s famous tragedies, and if you wish to go all in on Shakespeare analysis, there are many elements you could compare in the two plays. Both of the tragic heroes, Hamlet and Macbeth, are \u003cstrong\u003einfluenced by the supernatural \u003c/strong\u003eright from the start: Hamlet meets the ghost of his father, and Macbeth meets the three witches. They both receive vital information during this meeting that propels them towards their downfall. However, whereas Hamlet tends to overthink everything, Macbeth soon decides to act before thinking. All of this allows for a discussion of responsibility; do we blame the supernatural powers or the tragic heroes themselves for their downfall?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe role of women\u003c/strong\u003e in the two plays is very interesting, too. You might say that neither play portrays women in a very positive light. In \u003cem\u003eHamlet\u003c/em\u003e, Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s mother Gertrude happily marries her murdered husband\u0026rsquo;s brother Claudius and thus keeps her position as queen, and in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e, Lady Macbeth has no scruples encouraging her husband to kill the king, making her queen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, both women die during their husband\u0026rsquo;s reign as king. (The same goes for Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s sweetheart Ophelia who appears to go mad and kill herself in the wake of her lover\u0026rsquo;s quest for power, just like Lady Macbeth). Analytically, you might discuss these women\u0026rsquo;s level of ambition and how much responsibility we may place on them when it comes to the downfall of the tragic hero.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two plays share many \u003cstrong\u003ethemes\u003c/strong\u003e. For instance: appearance versus reality, identity, or revenge and justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNon-fiction\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are fascinated with Lady Macbeth and want to \u003cstrong\u003eexamine the theme of femininity and power \u003c/strong\u003ein Macbeth, you might want to compare Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s play to the article \u003cstrong\u003e\u0022Why I Picked Up a Gun\u0022 by Tiffany Hyatt\u003c/strong\u003e. In it, a single mother of four explains why she decided to carry a gun and train herself in handling it after having been raped and beaten. She has now become an advocate for women carrying guns for self-defence and believes that modern women ought to rediscover the self-reliant spirit which American women of the past displayed; she argues they often defended their homes and family as well as the men did. Her attitude and determination resembles that of Lady Macbeth who also decides to be a go-getter and remove all threats, although you might argue that she uses her husband as a weapon instead of wielding one herself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to \u003cstrong\u003eexamine the theme of masculinity and femininity\u003c/strong\u003e in Macbeth, you might want to compare Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s play to the article \u003cstrong\u003e\u0022Trump is a Climax of American Masculinity\u0022 by James Hamblin\u003c/strong\u003e. The writer argues that Donald Trump represents stereotypical masculinity, which appeals to his main supporters - white men without a degree - since these supporters feel that their own masculinity is threatened. Examples of this archetypical behaviour are that Trump shouts at people, refuses to apologise, rarely smiles, and openly prefers beautiful young women. Although his behaviour and statements frequently cause outrage, he is successful. In Macbeth, Macbeth frequently argues with his wife about what makes a man masculine, and Lady Macbeth herself challenges gender conventions with her \u0026ldquo;unsex me\u0026rdquo; soliloquy and dominant behaviour. Despite almost having switched roles with one another, the Macbeth couple is successful - at least for a time.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Perspectives on Macbeth","MetaDescription":"Shakespeare’s Macbeth is believed to have been first performed in 1606 and was probably written shortly before that.
