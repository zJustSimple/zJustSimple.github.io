Because of its age, the language can be difficult, and knowing about the historical context is important for understanding the text. In what follows, we will take you though some of the most important background information for analysing the play.&nbsp;Even if you are just studying a short extract from the play, it will be good for you to know about the context.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="a3b75c59-22b4-417c-82d4-bde38ce53a81">The genre of Macbeth: drama</h2><p>William Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Macbeth</i> is a <strong>drama</strong> or play. To analyse a text, you need to understand its genre and the characteristics of this genre. Importantly, <strong>in a play there is no narrator</strong>: without direct access to the characters&rsquo; thoughts and feelings, which a narrator would normally give us, we need to work out the characterisation and motives of the characters by observing what they say (their <strong>dialogue</strong>) and what they do (their<strong> actions</strong>, as indicated in the text).</p><p>When a play is <strong>staged</strong>, its interpretation relies on the decisions of the directors and actors as well as the text itself. However, in this study guide we are going to focus on the <strong>text</strong> of the play. This is typically the way we work in English class: text-based.</p><p>More specifically, <i>Macbeth</i> is also a <strong>tragedy</strong>. Shakespeare wrote in various genres, including tragedies, comedies, and history plays. In general, tragedies follow a central character who goes through various struggles, often caused by fate and by <strong>a tragic flaw</strong> within the character that he or she cannot overcome. These elements can be found in <i>Macbeth</i>, as in other Shakespearean tragedies such as <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King Lear</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The genre of tragedy was first invented in Athens in Ancient Greece</strong>. By watching a play based on human suffering, the audience both empathises and feels a sense of relief that they are in fact distanced from the events by their awareness of the fictional nature of the play and by the extreme characteristics of the characters. This sense of relief is known as <strong>&ldquo;catharsis&rdquo; </strong>and is essential to the genre of tragedy. So, if you ever felt sorry for Macbeth and his tragic end, you may just have gone through a bit of catharsis.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="9ea7f5ac-872b-46a3-9444-638b2aba9ff0">The historical context of Macbeth: the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras</h2><p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s literary production falls across two different eras in English history. His first works belong to the<strong> Elizabethan era</strong>, named after the renowned <strong>Queen Elizabeth I </strong>(reigned 1558-1603) who was also called the &ldquo;Virgin Queen&rdquo;. His later works (including <i>Macbeth</i>) belong to the <strong>Jacobean era</strong>, named after the Scottish <strong>King James VI </strong>(reigned 1603-1625).</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the &ldquo;Virgin Queen&rdquo; did not marry or produce any children, so on her death James VI of Scotland, Elizabeth&rsquo;s relative, became King James I of England. He had a claim to the throne and was a Protestant like Elizabeth, and therefore acceptable. He remained King of Scotland, so England and Scotland were finally united. Up until then, Britain had been a rather chaotic place at times, particularly because of an ongoing fight for dominance between Catholicism and Protestantism. However, chaos did not end entirely with this union.</p><p>Note that<strong> you will see us using the term &ldquo;Elizabethan&rdquo; about the historical context of </strong><i><strong>Macbeth</strong></i> in this study guide. The play is thought to have been first performed in <strong>1606 </strong>and was most likely written around the end of the Elizabethan era and the beginning of the Jacobean era. This means that<strong> the play would have been highly influenced by the ideas of the Elizabethan era, as well as commenting on the politics and society of the Jacobean era</strong>. One example is the play&rsquo;s preoccupation with the consequences of regicide. <i>Macbeth </i>was performed shortly after the failed Gunpowder Plot led by Guy Fawkes in 1605, which was a Catholic attempt to blow up Parliament and the Protestant King.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="b1c9d75c-d3ba-460d-856a-f47247808592">The Elizabethan world picture: the Chain of Being</h2><p><strong>The Elizabethan world picture&nbsp;was strongly influenced by Christianity</strong>, which means that ideas such as Judgment Day and good vs. evil are evident in <i>Macbeth</i>. The Elizabethans also believed in order and were always worried that the universe would collapse into chaos. They thought that <strong>everything had its particular place in a strict hierarchy determined by God</strong>, which was promoted by the church and state. Each element of creation was seen as a link in this great<strong> "Chain of Being"</strong>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="../cms/media/images/9249/Engleza/chain_of_being%20(1).svg"><figcaption>Fig. 1. The Chain of Being (the Elizabethan world picture).</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The highest-ranking human being was the king</strong> (or, during the Elizabethan era, the queen), who was believed to have been placed in this privileged position by God. The king or queen only had to answer to God &ndash; not to the people. The idea of God-given royalty. Each element&rsquo;s place in this hierarchy was fixed, which is why it is such a crime when Macbeth usurps the throne by killing King Duncan. Macbeth is a nobleman whereas Duncan is a king anointed by God, and killing your king &ndash; <strong>regicide</strong> &ndash; is the worst possible sin because it goes against God&rsquo;s will. It would eventually send you to Hell as a sinner.</p><p><strong>Human beings occupied a position in the middle of the Chain of Being</strong>. One the one hand, humans were believed to embody divine qualities like reason and love, but on the other hand, they were trapped in a physical body (like the animals), which meant constantly fighting primitive impulses like hunger, pain, and sexual desire. Giving in to your <strong>passion</strong> would take you further from God and salvation, so you ought to use your <strong>reason</strong>. You would also need to know yourself &ndash; your <strong>identity</strong> &ndash; in order to use your reason.</p><p>Interestingly, <strong>the Elizabethans believed in free will while also believing in destiny</strong>. This may seem like <strong>a strange paradox</strong> to modern readers, but the Elizabethan world picture&nbsp;was a mixture of old medieval ideas and modern renaissance ideas. Superhuman forces such as the stars controlled everything, including the lives of human beings, but at the same time humans had been given reason and free will by God &ndash; almost like a lifeline in the game of life. If you used your skills the right way, you would not fall into passion and sin.</p><p>Many of <strong>Shakespeare&rsquo;s great tragic heroes</strong> fall because they fail to use their God-given reason correctly. Again, Macbeth is a good example: he fully realises the consequences of killing his king, but he decides to do it anyway, partly because he is tricked by evil supernatural powers in the shape of the three witches, and partly because his character is flawed.</p><p>The Elizabethans believed that <strong>everything in the universe was connected</strong>. If you upset the balance in a kingdom on Earth (a <strong>microcosm</strong>), you automatically upset the balance in the entire universe (a <strong>macrocosm</strong>). In <i>Macbeth</i>, the murder of King Duncan is mirrored in the strange weather and animals behaving strangely, which we hear about after the murder. This means that if you failed to control yourself, you would not be the only one to suffer from it.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="e46d52eb-a9d1-48ff-83fc-0794479863e6">Theatre in Shakespeare&rsquo;s day</h2><p>Both Queen Elizabeth and King James were interested in theatre, and Shakespeare performed or had his plays performed for both rulers. <strong>King James I even became the patron &ndash; a financial supporter &ndash; of Shakespeare and his acting company</strong>.</p><p><strong>Theatre was very different in the Elizabethan era</strong>. Today, young people often associate the theatre with something serious and intellectual. (Be honest: when was the last time <i>you</i> went to the theatre?). In the 1500s and 1600s, however, <strong>theatre was for everyone</strong>, and people from all social classes would go to an open-air playhouse in London to be entertained. The audience generally talked and ate while they watched, and throwing food at the actors was not unheard of. The play would be punctuated by songs and dances, even in the case of a tragedy. <strong>Staging was minimal</strong>, with no elaborate props or special effects.</p><p>Another key element of both Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre was that <strong>women were not allowed on stage</strong>. All female roles were played by young boys whose voices had not broken. The reason was that <strong>acting was considered immoral</strong> and was not a profession for respectable people &ndash; especially women, who were generally excluded from the job market and who were expected&nbsp;to appear virginal and innocent, at least&nbsp;if they were upper class.&nbsp; Again, we see a clear contrast to theatre today.</p><p>So, when reading <i>Macbeth</i>, you might want to imagine a teenage boy playing Lady Macbeth! This becomes particularly interesting in Act 1, Scene 5 when Lady Macbeth delivers her famous &ldquo;unsex me&rdquo; soliloquy, where she asks that her female characteristics be removed and replaced with male characteristics such as cruelty. Here, <strong>Shakespeare seems to play with the notion of the actor&rsquo;s gender</strong>, drawing the audience&rsquo;s attention to the irony of the role being played by a boy.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="6818e6e8-ef08-4415-937a-930004aa2cae">Macbeth as a comment on&nbsp;society: King James I</h2><p><strong>Literature has always commented on society</strong>, and <i>Macbeth </i>is no exception. It is believed that <i>Macbeth</i> was probably first performed in 1606 &ndash; in front of King James I and his brother-in-law, the Danish King Christian IV. As we have already seen, James I was also King of Scotland. This is interesting, because <i>Macbeth</i> as the play tells the story of a Scottish nobleman who usurps the English throne and loses everything in his lust for power. At first glance, <strong>this might seem like a bold criticism of the new ruler </strong>who had only been King of England for three years at the time, and the political relevance of the play would not have been lost on the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>However, <i><strong>Macbeth</strong></i><strong> is generally believed to support King James&rsquo; right to the English throne</strong>. In Act 4, Scene 1, Macbeth consults the three witches and sees a vision of eight kings, the last of which holds a mirror to indicate that more kings are to follow. Macbeth thinks they all look like Banquo, whom the witches have said will father future kings. In Shakespeare&rsquo;s day, <strong>King James I was believed to be a descendant of Banquo</strong>, who was thought to be a real, historical person who founded the Scottish Stuart dynasty of kings. (Ironically, Banquo never existed). Many experts interpret this mirror scene as political propaganda &ndash; Shakespeare saying that James does indeed have a right to the throne.</p><p>Interestingly,<strong> the historical Banquo was said to have been Macbeth&rsquo;s accomplice</strong> all the way. By turning him into a hero and loyal subject, Shakespeare is flattering his King. Another sign of flattery is the witches: James I firmly believed in the existence of witchcraft and actively fought it, and a play about evil witches (even in his mother country Scotland!) would undoubtedly catch his interest.</p><p>To sum up, <strong>the keywords for you to take away here are</strong>: tragedy, the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, the strict hierarchy of the Chain of Being, no female actors, and <i>Macbeth</i>&rsquo;s indirect support for King James&rsquo; claim to the throne.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="rezumat.html" title="Macbeth Rezumat" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span></a><a href="analysis.html" title="Analysis of Macbeth" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Analysis</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Because of its age, the language can be difficult, and knowing about the historical context is important for understanding the text. In what follows, we will take you though some of the most important background information for analysing the play.\u0026nbsp;Even if you are just studying a short extract from the play, it will be good for you to know about the context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a3b75c59-22b4-417c-82d4-bde38ce53a81\u0022\u003eThe genre of Macbeth: drama\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliam Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e is a \u003cstrong\u003edrama\u003c/strong\u003e or play. To analyse a text, you need to understand its genre and the characteristics of this genre. Importantly, \u003cstrong\u003ein a play there is no narrator\u003c/strong\u003e: without direct access to the characters\u0026rsquo; thoughts and feelings, which a narrator would normally give us, we need to work out the characterisation and motives of the characters by observing what they say (their \u003cstrong\u003edialogue\u003c/strong\u003e) and what they do (their\u003cstrong\u003e actions\u003c/strong\u003e, as indicated in the text).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a play is \u003cstrong\u003estaged\u003c/strong\u003e, its interpretation relies on the decisions of the directors and actors as well as the text itself. However, in this study guide we are going to focus on the \u003cstrong\u003etext\u003c/strong\u003e of the play. This is typically the way we work in English class: text-based.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore specifically, \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e is also a \u003cstrong\u003etragedy\u003c/strong\u003e. Shakespeare wrote in various genres, including tragedies, comedies, and history plays. In general, tragedies follow a central character who goes through various struggles, often caused by fate and by \u003cstrong\u003ea tragic flaw\u003c/strong\u003e within the character that he or she cannot overcome. These elements can be found in \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e, as in other Shakespearean tragedies such as \u003ci\u003eHamlet\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eKing Lear\u003c/i\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe genre of tragedy was first invented in Athens in Ancient Greece\u003c/strong\u003e. By watching a play based on human suffering, the audience both empathises and feels a sense of relief that they are in fact distanced from the events by their awareness of the fictional nature of the play and by the extreme characteristics of the characters. This sense of relief is known as \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;catharsis\u0026rdquo; \u003c/strong\u003eand is essential to the genre of tragedy. So, if you ever felt sorry for Macbeth and his tragic end, you may just have gone through a bit of catharsis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00229ea7f5ac-872b-46a3-9444-638b2aba9ff0\u0022\u003eThe historical context of Macbeth: the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eShakespeare\u0026rsquo;s literary production falls across two different eras in English history. His first works belong to the\u003cstrong\u003e Elizabethan era\u003c/strong\u003e, named after the renowned \u003cstrong\u003eQueen Elizabeth I \u003c/strong\u003e(reigned 1558-1603) who was also called the \u0026ldquo;Virgin Queen\u0026rdquo;. His later works (including \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e) belong to the \u003cstrong\u003eJacobean era\u003c/strong\u003e, named after the Scottish \u003cstrong\u003eKing James VI \u003c/strong\u003e(reigned 1603-1625).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps not surprisingly, the \u0026ldquo;Virgin Queen\u0026rdquo; did not marry or produce any children, so on her death James VI of Scotland, Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s relative, became King James I of England. He had a claim to the throne and was a Protestant like Elizabeth, and therefore acceptable. He remained King of Scotland, so England and Scotland were finally united. Up until then, Britain had been a rather chaotic place at times, particularly because of an ongoing fight for dominance between Catholicism and Protestantism. However, chaos did not end entirely with this union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that\u003cstrong\u003e you will see us using the term \u0026ldquo;Elizabethan\u0026rdquo; about the historical context of \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e in this study guide. The play is thought to have been first performed in \u003cstrong\u003e1606 \u003c/strong\u003eand was most likely written around the end of the Elizabethan era and the beginning of the Jacobean era. This means that\u003cstrong\u003e the play would have been highly influenced by the ideas of the Elizabethan era, as well as commenting on the politics and society of the Jacobean era\u003c/strong\u003e. One example is the play\u0026rsquo;s preoccupation with the consequences of regicide. \u003ci\u003eMacbeth \u003c/i\u003ewas performed shortly after the failed Gunpowder Plot led by Guy Fawkes in 1605, which was a Catholic attempt to blow up Parliament and the Protestant King.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022b1c9d75c-d3ba-460d-856a-f47247808592\u0022\u003eThe Elizabethan world picture: the Chain of Being\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Elizabethan world picture\u0026nbsp;was strongly influenced by Christianity\u003c/strong\u003e, which means that ideas such as Judgment Day and good vs. evil are evident in \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e. The Elizabethans also believed in order and were always worried that the universe would collapse into chaos. They thought that \u003cstrong\u003eeverything had its particular place in a strict hierarchy determined by God\u003c/strong\u003e, which was promoted by the church and state. Each element of creation was seen as a link in this great\u003cstrong\u003e \u0022Chain of Being\u0022\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\u0022image\u0022\u003e\u003cimg src=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/cms/media/images/9249/Engleza/chain_of_being%20(1).svg\u0022\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFig. 1. The Chain of Being (the Elizabethan world picture).\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe highest-ranking human being was the king\u003c/strong\u003e (or, during the Elizabethan era, the queen), who was believed to have been placed in this privileged position by God. The king or queen only had to answer to God \u0026ndash; not to the people. The idea of God-given royalty. Each element\u0026rsquo;s place in this hierarchy was fixed, which is why it is such a crime when Macbeth usurps the throne by killing King Duncan. Macbeth is a nobleman whereas Duncan is a king anointed by God, and killing your king \u0026ndash; \u003cstrong\u003eregicide\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; is the worst possible sin because it goes against God\u0026rsquo;s will. It would eventually send you to Hell as a sinner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHuman beings occupied a position in the middle of the Chain of Being\u003c/strong\u003e. One the one hand, humans were believed to embody divine qualities like reason and love, but on the other hand, they were trapped in a physical body (like the animals), which meant constantly fighting primitive impulses like hunger, pain, and sexual desire. Giving in to your \u003cstrong\u003epassion\u003c/strong\u003e would take you further from God and salvation, so you ought to use your \u003cstrong\u003ereason\u003c/strong\u003e. You would also need to know yourself \u0026ndash; your \u003cstrong\u003eidentity\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; in order to use your reason.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Elizabethans believed in free will while also believing in destiny\u003c/strong\u003e. This may seem like \u003cstrong\u003ea strange paradox\u003c/strong\u003e to modern readers, but the Elizabethan world picture\u0026nbsp;was a mixture of old medieval ideas and modern renaissance ideas. Superhuman forces such as the stars controlled everything, including the lives of human beings, but at the same time humans had been given reason and free will by God \u0026ndash; almost like a lifeline in the game of life. If you used your skills the right way, you would not fall into passion and sin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of \u003cstrong\u003eShakespeare\u0026rsquo;s great tragic heroes\u003c/strong\u003e fall because they fail to use their God-given reason correctly. Again, Macbeth is a good example: he fully realises the consequences of killing his king, but he decides to do it anyway, partly because he is tricked by evil supernatural powers in the shape of the three witches, and partly because his character is flawed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Elizabethans believed that \u003cstrong\u003eeverything in the universe was connected\u003c/strong\u003e. If you upset the balance in a kingdom on Earth (a \u003cstrong\u003emicrocosm\u003c/strong\u003e), you automatically upset the balance in the entire universe (a \u003cstrong\u003emacrocosm\u003c/strong\u003e). In \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e, the murder of King Duncan is mirrored in the strange weather and animals behaving strangely, which we hear about after the murder. This means that if you failed to control yourself, you would not be the only one to suffer from it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e46d52eb-a9d1-48ff-83fc-0794479863e6\u0022\u003eTheatre in Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s day\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Queen Elizabeth and King James were interested in theatre, and Shakespeare performed or had his plays performed for both rulers. \u003cstrong\u003eKing James I even became the patron \u0026ndash; a financial supporter \u0026ndash; of Shakespeare and his acting company\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheatre was very different in the Elizabethan era\u003c/strong\u003e. Today, young people often associate the theatre with something serious and intellectual. (Be honest: when was the last time \u003ci\u003eyou\u003c/i\u003e went to the theatre?). In the 1500s and 1600s, however, \u003cstrong\u003etheatre was for everyone\u003c/strong\u003e, and people from all social classes would go to an open-air playhouse in London to be entertained. The audience generally talked and ate while they watched, and throwing food at the actors was not unheard of. The play would be punctuated by songs and dances, even in the case of a tragedy. \u003cstrong\u003eStaging was minimal\u003c/strong\u003e, with no elaborate props or special effects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother key element of both Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre was that \u003cstrong\u003ewomen were not allowed on stage\u003c/strong\u003e. All female roles were played by young boys whose voices had not broken. The reason was that \u003cstrong\u003eacting was considered immoral\u003c/strong\u003e and was not a profession for respectable people \u0026ndash; especially women, who were generally excluded from the job market and who were expected\u0026nbsp;to appear virginal and innocent, at least\u0026nbsp;if they were upper class.\u0026nbsp; Again, we see a clear contrast to theatre today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, when reading \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e, you might want to imagine a teenage boy playing Lady Macbeth! This becomes particularly interesting in Act 1, Scene 5 when Lady Macbeth delivers her famous \u0026ldquo;unsex me\u0026rdquo; soliloquy, where she asks that her female characteristics be removed and replaced with male characteristics such as cruelty. Here, \u003cstrong\u003eShakespeare seems to play with the notion of the actor\u0026rsquo;s gender\u003c/strong\u003e, drawing the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention to the irony of the role being played by a boy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u00226818e6e8-ef08-4415-937a-930004aa2cae\u0022\u003eMacbeth as a comment on\u0026nbsp;society: King James I\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiterature has always commented on society\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eMacbeth \u003c/i\u003eis no exception. It is believed that \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e was probably first performed in 1606 \u0026ndash; in front of King James I and his brother-in-law, the Danish King Christian IV. As we have already seen, James I was also King of Scotland. This is interesting, because \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e as the play tells the story of a Scottish nobleman who usurps the English throne and loses everything in his lust for power. At first glance, \u003cstrong\u003ethis might seem like a bold criticism of the new ruler \u003c/strong\u003ewho had only been King of England for three years at the time, and the political relevance of the play would not have been lost on the audience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e is generally believed to support King James\u0026rsquo; right to the English throne\u003c/strong\u003e. In Act 4, Scene 1, Macbeth consults the three witches and sees a vision of eight kings, the last of which holds a mirror to indicate that more kings are to follow. Macbeth thinks they all look like Banquo, whom the witches have said will father future kings. In Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s day, \u003cstrong\u003eKing James I was believed to be a descendant of Banquo\u003c/strong\u003e, who was thought to be a real, historical person who founded the Scottish Stuart dynasty of kings. (Ironically, Banquo never existed). Many experts interpret this mirror scene as political propaganda \u0026ndash; Shakespeare saying that James does indeed have a right to the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly,\u003cstrong\u003e the historical Banquo was said to have been Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s accomplice\u003c/strong\u003e all the way. By turning him into a hero and loyal subject, Shakespeare is flattering his King. Another sign of flattery is the witches: James I firmly believed in the existence of witchcraft and actively fought it, and a play about evil witches (even in his mother country Scotland!) would undoubtedly catch his interest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo sum up, \u003cstrong\u003ethe keywords for you to take away here are\u003c/strong\u003e: tragedy, the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, the strict hierarchy of the Chain of Being, no female actors, and \u003ci\u003eMacbeth\u003c/i\u003e\u0026rsquo;s indirect support for King James\u0026rsquo; claim to the throne.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Background information on Macbeth","MetaDescription":"Shakespeare’s Macbeth is over 400 years old and one of the most famous works of literature ever written.
