To some, she is the manipulative embodiment of evil. To others, she is a loyal, supportive wife.&nbsp;In any case, her character develops extensively over the course of the play - just like her husband&rsquo;s.</p><p>From the very first moment we meet her (in Act 1, Scene 5),<strong> Lady Macbeth is strong-willed and ambitious</strong>. She is reading a letter from her husband about the witches&rsquo; prophecy, and unlike Macbeth who initially seems doubtful, Lady Macbeth is more than ready to seize power. She seems to<strong> know her husband well</strong> and already realises that Macbeth is &ldquo;not without ambition, but without/ The illness should attend it.&rdquo; (1.5.19-20). She believes he is simply not ruthless enough to aim for the throne, and to her that is a weakness.</p><p>Lady Macbeth does not spend time reflecting like her husband does; instead she acts immediately. In her<strong> famous &ldquo;unsex me&rdquo; soliloquy</strong>, she calls upon evil spirits to remove all her feminine (and thereby weak) qualities:</p><blockquote><p>Unsex me here,<br />And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full<br />Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;<br />Stop up the access and passage to remorse [...]<br />Come to my woman&rsquo;s breasts,<br />And take my milk for gall. (1.5.45-52)</p></blockquote><p>She literally asks to be filled with cruelty and to have remorse removed from her body. She also asks that her milk &ndash; produced naturally by her body - be exchanged with gall, a bitter fluid produced by the liver and associated with evil.</p><p>In Shakespeare&rsquo;s day, <strong>women were considered weaker than men</strong>, which explains why Lady Macbeth now wants nothing to do with traditionally feminine characteristics like producing milk for babies. The point is that if she becomes stronger (and more masculine), she will be able to assist her weak husband in seizing power. Her soliloquy therefore indicates to us that she believes that both she and her husband have too much compassion, which she thinks will stop them from succeeding. Her words show that she is willing to go against nature to achieve her goals. Overall,<strong> Lady Macbeth seems stronger than her husband</strong>, at least in the beginning of the play.</p><p>Interestingly, <strong>Lady Macbeth addresses the spirits using the imperative</strong><strong>:</strong> when she says &ldquo;unsex me&rdquo; or &ldquo;fill me&rdquo;, she is directly <em>ordering</em> the evil spirits to do what she says. The Elizabethans believed in spirits as strongly as they believed in traditional gender roles. To them, Lady Macbeth would seem like a very frightening&nbsp;and unnatural woman as she is bossing around spirits and rejecting feminine characteristics. An Elizabethan audience would probably also say that by calling upon evil spirits she <strong>is allowing herself to be possessed by the devil </strong>- a great sin and sign of seriously bad judgement.</p><p>According to the Elizabethan idea of the Chain of Being, an unnatural, dominant woman like Lady Macbeth would be a clear sign that the natural order of things had been upset. You can read more about the Chain of Being in our <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/background-information">Background information</a> section. To modern readers like us, however, Lady Macbeth may seem like a strong woman and a real go-getter. She knows herself and what she wants.</p><p>As soon as Lady Macbeth speaks to her husband after learning about the prophecy, <strong>she takes charge</strong> and says: &ldquo;Leave all the rest to me.&rdquo; (1.5.82).&nbsp;Thus, <strong>she becomes a catalyst for Macbeth&rsquo;s attempt to gain power</strong> - just like the witches. Later, when Macbeth gets cold feet after reflecting on the consequences of killing their king, she mocks his lack of manliness: &ldquo;When you durst do it, then you were a man.&rdquo; (1.7.54-55). Once again, Shakespeare underlines how she is unnaturally bold and masculine compared to her husband.</p><p>She proceeds to say that she would have killed her own baby and &ldquo;dash&rsquo;d [its] brains out&rdquo; if <em>she</em> had lost courage like Macbeth has (1.7.59-64). These lines paint a gruesome picture of Lady Macbeth, which is probably why many consider her a tyrant wife who bullies her weak husband into becoming a murderer.</p><p><strong>Lady Macbeth refers to a baby and the joys of motherhood</strong>: &ldquo;I have given suck, and know/ How tender it is to love the babe that milks me.&rdquo; (1.7.59-60). However, in the play she and Macbeth no longer have a baby and we never learn what happened to it. Her husband refers to future babies when he recognises her strength by saying: &ldquo;Bring forth men-children only;/ For thy undaunted mettle should compose/ Nothing but males.&rdquo; (1.7.80-82).&nbsp;Again, we see the idea of her being almost masculine: she is so tough that she should only ever give birth to boys.</p><p>Only once does <strong>Lady Macbeth display humanity or weakness</strong> (depending on how you look at it). As her husband is off to kill Duncan, she admits to herself: &ldquo;Had [Duncan] not resembled/ My father as he slept, I had done&rsquo;t.&rdquo; (2.2.15-16).&nbsp;Feeling as if she is murdering her own father is too much, even for her. Two other actions of hers may be read as signs of her having a soft side: she faints as Duncan&rsquo;s death is discovered (2.3.152), and she eventually kills herself (5.9.41-43). Here, the play is open to interpretation. She may pretend to faint to draw attention away from her husband&rsquo;s whereabouts on the murder night, or she may be overwhelmed by guilt as she is realising what they have done. Her suicide may be the logical choice for someone facing defeat and legal prosecution, or she may have killed herself out of guilt.</p><p>Although Lady Macbeth may appear dominant, it is also possible to <strong>interpret her character as a loving and loyal wife</strong>. The play never explicitly mentions any <em>personal</em> ambition of hers; she never says that she longs to become queen. The only thing the play clearly shows us is that she is ambitious for her husband, whom she knows is ambitious himself. By encouraging him to aim for the throne - which fate already seems to have promised him - it could be argued that she is only doing what would be expected of a loyal wife at the time.</p><p>No matter how we choose to view Lady Macbeth, everything has its price. Towards the end of the play, <strong>conscience catches up with her</strong> and she starts sleepwalking before eventually killing herself. Ironically, <strong>she foreshadows her own end </strong>when she says right after the murder of Duncan: &ldquo;These deeds must not be thought/ After these ways; so, it will make us mad.&rdquo; (2.2.44-45). She knows that thinking too much about their evil doings will make her and her husband lose their minds, and that is what happens to her in the end.</p><p>Thus, in Act 5, Scene 1, we see her sleepwalking, clearly haunted by the murders of Duncan, Banquo, and Macduff&rsquo;s family. &ldquo;Will these hands ne&rsquo;er be clean?&rdquo; (5.1.39), she asks, feeling that her sin has metaphorically stained her hands with blood. This is when she makes her <strong>famous &ldquo;out, damned spot&rdquo; soliloquy</strong>.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="8baa5cf4-07a0-4097-9407-4ffdaa2435a0">Lady Macbeth - villain or victim?</h2><p>Whether we consider Lady Macbeth a villain or a victim and are able to feel any <strong>sympathy</strong> with her towards the end may depend on our individual impression of her. As we outline above, we may see her as overly dominant and heartless or simply as a loving, supportive wife. In any case, Lady Macbeth&nbsp;seems to end the play as a more sympathetic character than she began. You could ask yourself about your own impression of Lady Macbeth: do you pity her?</p><p>Comparing Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s toughness to her husband&rsquo;s becomes even more interesting towards the end of the play. Macbeth, too, is troubled by the many killings, but he seems to get used to it as time goes by. Lady Macbeth starts off as a strong character but ends up being destroyed by her own guilt. In the end, her husband appears to be the stronger one. You might argue that <strong>when it comes to murder, Macbeth is a marathon runner while his wife is only a sprinter</strong>.</p><p>In our <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/interpretation/themes">Themes</a> section, we discuss Lady Macbeth's role and responsibility when it comes to Macbeth's downfall, as well as the general portrayal of women in the play.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="c54502b1-995e-4809-aa83-f326122d5ab2">The relationship between Lady Macbeth and Macbeth</h2><p>Lady Macbeth and Macbeth are not a young couple like the lovers in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and they have been together for a long time. We sense that they know each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and complement each other. The fact that Macbeth chooses to reveal the secret of the prophecy to his wife (the letter in Act 1, Scene 5) shows that <strong>they have a close relationship</strong> - perhaps unusually close for a time when most marriages were marriages of convenience. In the letter, he addresses her as &ldquo;my dearest partner of greatness&rdquo; (1.5.11), which shows his respect for her judgment, and later he lovingly greets her with &ldquo;my dearest love&rdquo; (1.5.64).</p><p>Interestingly, Shakespeare indicates that <strong>Lady Macbeth is Macbeth&rsquo;s &ldquo;spur&rdquo;</strong> - the one who kick-starts his ambition. In Act 1, Scene 7 Macbeth reflects on the consequences of killing Duncan and arrives at the logical conclusion: he simply cannot do it because it would be wrong in every way. He says: &ldquo;I have no spur/ To prick the sides of my intent.&rdquo; (1.7.25-26). Almost immediately Lady Macbeth enters the stage, buzzing with energy (1.7.29). A little while later, she has persuaded him to stick to their plan of killing Duncan.</p><p>This staging is Shakespeare&rsquo;s subtle way of showing us how important Lady Macbeth is to Macbeth&rsquo;s actions. When they start plotting their path to the throne, they literally become <strong>partners in crime</strong>.</p><p>However, if you do some close-reading, there are signs that <strong>they start to drift apart</strong> over the course of the play. Act 2, Scene 2 is where it begins. Macbeth is now king, and it is the night of the banquet. Although Macbeth has made plans to have Banquo murdered that same night, he asks his wife to take good care of Banquo at tonight&rsquo;s feast - despite knowing that Banquo will be dead by then. Macbeth then hints at Banquo and Fleance not being immortal, and when his wife asks: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; (2.2.50), Macbeth just replies: &ldquo;Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,/ Till thou applaud the deed.&rdquo; (2.2.51-52).&nbsp;He does not confide in her - despite the fact that they have so far planned everything together.</p><p>This is the first time we&nbsp;see Macbeth taking charge. Sadly, this also means that <strong>he starts hiding things from his wife: </strong>Macbeth becomes a stranger to his wife as well as to himself.</p><p>Lady Macbeth gets one final appearance in the play to demonstrate her determination and strength: In the ensuing banquet scene (Act 2, Scene 4) where Macbeth thinks he sees Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, she does everything she can to appeal to his reason and protect him from losing face in front of his loyal thanes. However, have a look at the end of the scene: Lady Macbeth does not demand an explanation once the banquet guests have left. She has almost no lines here, suggesting that <strong>she has grown strangely quiet or passive</strong>.</p><p>After this incident, Lady Macbeth&nbsp;disappears from the story for quite a while. The next time we meet her (Act 5, Scene 1), she has started to become insane and is sleepwalking. Shakespeare never gives us any clear answers about why this transformation in Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s character takes place, so it is open to interpretation.</p><p>A close-reading like this generally seems to suggest that Macbeth shuts out his wife, which damages their relationship. As they both start struggling with their own demons, they drift apart. <strong>Macbeth&rsquo;s reaction to the news of his wife&rsquo;s death is ambiguous:</strong> &ldquo;She should have died hereafter.&rdquo; (5.5.19). One way of interpreting this line is that Macbeth coldly says that she chose a very inconvenient time to die; he is busy preparing for battle! You could also contrast this response to the way Macduff reacts to the news that his family has been murdered in Act 3, Scene 3: Macduff is shocked and swears revenge. We find none of this passion in Macbeth&rsquo;s reaction.</p><p>Another - more positive - interpretation of Macbeth&rsquo;s response could be that Macbeth is remarking that Lady Macbeth would have died eventually since their castle is under attack, or because everyone must die eventually. This interpretation suggests Macbeth is giving up, now that he has lost his loyal wife on top of most of his friends and followers. This sense of sadness and disillusion seems to be mirrored in Macbeth&rsquo;s ensuing speech on how short life is and how little meaning it holds (5.5.21-30). Macbeth is entirely alone now and feels like fate has fooled him. To him, life &ldquo;is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing.&rdquo; (5.5.28-30).</p><p>No matter how we interpret Macbeth&rsquo;s response to his wife&rsquo;s suicide, Lady Macbeth and Macbeth do not die together like the lovers in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. They both die <strong>a lonely death</strong>, riddled with guilt.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="the-protagonist.html" title="Characterisation of Macbeth" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The protagonist Macbeth</span></a><a href="the-witches.html" title="Characterisation of the witches in Macbeth" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The witches</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

To some, she is the manipulative embodiment of evil. To others, she is a loyal, supportive wife.\u0026nbsp;In any case, her character develops extensively over the course of the play - just like her husband\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the very first moment we meet her (in Act 1, Scene 5),\u003cstrong\u003e Lady Macbeth is strong-willed and ambitious\u003c/strong\u003e. She is reading a letter from her husband about the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy, and unlike Macbeth who initially seems doubtful, Lady Macbeth is more than ready to seize power. She seems to\u003cstrong\u003e know her husband well\u003c/strong\u003e and already realises that Macbeth is \u0026ldquo;not without ambition, but without/ The illness should attend it.\u0026rdquo; (1.5.19-20). She believes he is simply not ruthless enough to aim for the throne, and to her that is a weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLady Macbeth does not spend time reflecting like her husband does; instead she acts immediately. In her\u003cstrong\u003e famous \u0026ldquo;unsex me\u0026rdquo; soliloquy\u003c/strong\u003e, she calls upon evil spirits to remove all her feminine (and thereby weak) qualities:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnsex me here,\u003cbr /\u003eAnd fill me from the crown to the toe top-full\u003cbr /\u003eOf direst cruelty! make thick my blood;\u003cbr /\u003eStop up the access and passage to remorse [...]\u003cbr /\u003eCome to my woman\u0026rsquo;s breasts,\u003cbr /\u003eAnd take my milk for gall. (1.5.45-52)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe literally asks to be filled with cruelty and to have remorse removed from her body. She also asks that her milk \u0026ndash; produced naturally by her body - be exchanged with gall, a bitter fluid produced by the liver and associated with evil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s day, \u003cstrong\u003ewomen were considered weaker than men\u003c/strong\u003e, which explains why Lady Macbeth now wants nothing to do with traditionally feminine characteristics like producing milk for babies. The point is that if she becomes stronger (and more masculine), she will be able to assist her weak husband in seizing power. Her soliloquy therefore indicates to us that she believes that both she and her husband have too much compassion, which she thinks will stop them from succeeding. Her words show that she is willing to go against nature to achieve her goals. Overall,\u003cstrong\u003e Lady Macbeth seems stronger than her husband\u003c/strong\u003e, at least in the beginning of the play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, \u003cstrong\u003eLady Macbeth addresses the spirits using the imperative\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e when she says \u0026ldquo;unsex me\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;fill me\u0026rdquo;, she is directly \u003cem\u003eordering\u003c/em\u003e the evil spirits to do what she says. The Elizabethans believed in spirits as strongly as they believed in traditional gender roles. To them, Lady Macbeth would seem like a very frightening\u0026nbsp;and unnatural woman as she is bossing around spirits and rejecting feminine characteristics. An Elizabethan audience would probably also say that by calling upon evil spirits she \u003cstrong\u003eis allowing herself to be possessed by the devil \u003c/strong\u003e- a great sin and sign of seriously bad judgement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Elizabethan idea of the Chain of Being, an unnatural, dominant woman like Lady Macbeth would be a clear sign that the natural order of things had been upset. You can read more about the Chain of Being in our \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/background-information\u0022\u003eBackground information\u003c/a\u003e section. To modern readers like us, however, Lady Macbeth may seem like a strong woman and a real go-getter. She knows herself and what she wants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Lady Macbeth speaks to her husband after learning about the prophecy, \u003cstrong\u003eshe takes charge\u003c/strong\u003e and says: \u0026ldquo;Leave all the rest to me.\u0026rdquo; (1.5.82).\u0026nbsp;Thus, \u003cstrong\u003eshe becomes a catalyst for Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s attempt to gain power\u003c/strong\u003e - just like the witches. Later, when Macbeth gets cold feet after reflecting on the consequences of killing their king, she mocks his lack of manliness: \u0026ldquo;When you durst do it, then you were a man.\u0026rdquo; (1.7.54-55). Once again, Shakespeare underlines how she is unnaturally bold and masculine compared to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe proceeds to say that she would have killed her own baby and \u0026ldquo;dash\u0026rsquo;d [its] brains out\u0026rdquo; if \u003cem\u003eshe\u003c/em\u003e had lost courage like Macbeth has (1.7.59-64). These lines paint a gruesome picture of Lady Macbeth, which is probably why many consider her a tyrant wife who bullies her weak husband into becoming a murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLady Macbeth refers to a baby and the joys of motherhood\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;I have given suck, and know/ How tender it is to love the babe that milks me.\u0026rdquo; (1.7.59-60). However, in the play she and Macbeth no longer have a baby and we never learn what happened to it. Her husband refers to future babies when he recognises her strength by saying: \u0026ldquo;Bring forth men-children only;/ For thy undaunted mettle should compose/ Nothing but males.\u0026rdquo; (1.7.80-82).\u0026nbsp;Again, we see the idea of her being almost masculine: she is so tough that she should only ever give birth to boys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnly once does \u003cstrong\u003eLady Macbeth display humanity or weakness\u003c/strong\u003e (depending on how you look at it). As her husband is off to kill Duncan, she admits to herself: \u0026ldquo;Had [Duncan] not resembled/ My father as he slept, I had done\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; (2.2.15-16).\u0026nbsp;Feeling as if she is murdering her own father is too much, even for her. Two other actions of hers may be read as signs of her having a soft side: she faints as Duncan\u0026rsquo;s death is discovered (2.3.152), and she eventually kills herself (5.9.41-43). Here, the play is open to interpretation. She may pretend to faint to draw attention away from her husband\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts on the murder night, or she may be overwhelmed by guilt as she is realising what they have done. Her suicide may be the logical choice for someone facing defeat and legal prosecution, or she may have killed herself out of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Lady Macbeth may appear dominant, it is also possible to \u003cstrong\u003einterpret her character as a loving and loyal wife\u003c/strong\u003e. The play never explicitly mentions any \u003cem\u003epersonal\u003c/em\u003e ambition of hers; she never says that she longs to become queen. The only thing the play clearly shows us is that she is ambitious for her husband, whom she knows is ambitious himself. By encouraging him to aim for the throne - which fate already seems to have promised him - it could be argued that she is only doing what would be expected of a loyal wife at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo matter how we choose to view Lady Macbeth, everything has its price. Towards the end of the play, \u003cstrong\u003econscience catches up with her\u003c/strong\u003e and she starts sleepwalking before eventually killing herself. Ironically, \u003cstrong\u003eshe foreshadows her own end \u003c/strong\u003ewhen she says right after the murder of Duncan: \u0026ldquo;These deeds must not be thought/ After these ways; so, it will make us mad.\u0026rdquo; (2.2.44-45). She knows that thinking too much about their evil doings will make her and her husband lose their minds, and that is what happens to her in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, in Act 5, Scene 1, we see her sleepwalking, clearly haunted by the murders of Duncan, Banquo, and Macduff\u0026rsquo;s family. \u0026ldquo;Will these hands ne\u0026rsquo;er be clean?\u0026rdquo; (5.1.39), she asks, feeling that her sin has metaphorically stained her hands with blood. This is when she makes her \u003cstrong\u003efamous \u0026ldquo;out, damned spot\u0026rdquo; soliloquy\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00228baa5cf4-07a0-4097-9407-4ffdaa2435a0\u0022\u003eLady Macbeth - villain or victim?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether we consider Lady Macbeth a villain or a victim and are able to feel any \u003cstrong\u003esympathy\u003c/strong\u003e with her towards the end may depend on our individual impression of her. As we outline above, we may see her as overly dominant and heartless or simply as a loving, supportive wife. In any case, Lady Macbeth\u0026nbsp;seems to end the play as a more sympathetic character than she began. You could ask yourself about your own impression of Lady Macbeth: do you pity her?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComparing Lady Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s toughness to her husband\u0026rsquo;s becomes even more interesting towards the end of the play. Macbeth, too, is troubled by the many killings, but he seems to get used to it as time goes by. Lady Macbeth starts off as a strong character but ends up being destroyed by her own guilt. In the end, her husband appears to be the stronger one. You might argue that \u003cstrong\u003ewhen it comes to murder, Macbeth is a marathon runner while his wife is only a sprinter\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn our \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/interpretation/themes\u0022\u003eThemes\u003c/a\u003e section, we discuss Lady Macbeth\u0027s role and responsibility when it comes to Macbeth\u0027s downfall, as well as the general portrayal of women in the play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c54502b1-995e-4809-aa83-f326122d5ab2\u0022\u003eThe relationship between Lady Macbeth and Macbeth\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLady Macbeth and Macbeth are not a young couple like the lovers in \u003cem\u003eRomeo and Juliet\u003c/em\u003e and they have been together for a long time. We sense that they know each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and complement each other. The fact that Macbeth chooses to reveal the secret of the prophecy to his wife (the letter in Act 1, Scene 5) shows that \u003cstrong\u003ethey have a close relationship\u003c/strong\u003e - perhaps unusually close for a time when most marriages were marriages of convenience. In the letter, he addresses her as \u0026ldquo;my dearest partner of greatness\u0026rdquo; (1.5.11), which shows his respect for her judgment, and later he lovingly greets her with \u0026ldquo;my dearest love\u0026rdquo; (1.5.64).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, Shakespeare indicates that \u003cstrong\u003eLady Macbeth is Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;spur\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e - the one who kick-starts his ambition. In Act 1, Scene 7 Macbeth reflects on the consequences of killing Duncan and arrives at the logical conclusion: he simply cannot do it because it would be wrong in every way. He says: \u0026ldquo;I have no spur/ To prick the sides of my intent.\u0026rdquo; (1.7.25-26). Almost immediately Lady Macbeth enters the stage, buzzing with energy (1.7.29). A little while later, she has persuaded him to stick to their plan of killing Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis staging is Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s subtle way of showing us how important Lady Macbeth is to Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s actions. When they start plotting their path to the throne, they literally become \u003cstrong\u003epartners in crime\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you do some close-reading, there are signs that \u003cstrong\u003ethey start to drift apart\u003c/strong\u003e over the course of the play. Act 2, Scene 2 is where it begins. Macbeth is now king, and it is the night of the banquet. Although Macbeth has made plans to have Banquo murdered that same night, he asks his wife to take good care of Banquo at tonight\u0026rsquo;s feast - despite knowing that Banquo will be dead by then. Macbeth then hints at Banquo and Fleance not being immortal, and when his wife asks: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s to be done?\u0026rdquo; (2.2.50), Macbeth just replies: \u0026ldquo;Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,/ Till thou applaud the deed.\u0026rdquo; (2.2.51-52).\u0026nbsp;He does not confide in her - despite the fact that they have so far planned everything together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the first time we\u0026nbsp;see Macbeth taking charge. Sadly, this also means that \u003cstrong\u003ehe starts hiding things from his wife: \u003c/strong\u003eMacbeth becomes a stranger to his wife as well as to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLady Macbeth gets one final appearance in the play to demonstrate her determination and strength: In the ensuing banquet scene (Act 2, Scene 4) where Macbeth thinks he sees Banquo\u0026rsquo;s ghost, she does everything she can to appeal to his reason and protect him from losing face in front of his loyal thanes. However, have a look at the end of the scene: Lady Macbeth does not demand an explanation once the banquet guests have left. She has almost no lines here, suggesting that \u003cstrong\u003eshe has grown strangely quiet or passive\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter this incident, Lady Macbeth\u0026nbsp;disappears from the story for quite a while. The next time we meet her (Act 5, Scene 1), she has started to become insane and is sleepwalking. Shakespeare never gives us any clear answers about why this transformation in Lady Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s character takes place, so it is open to interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA close-reading like this generally seems to suggest that Macbeth shuts out his wife, which damages their relationship. As they both start struggling with their own demons, they drift apart. \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth\u0026rsquo;s reaction to the news of his wife\u0026rsquo;s death is ambiguous:\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ldquo;She should have died hereafter.\u0026rdquo; (5.5.19). One way of interpreting this line is that Macbeth coldly says that she chose a very inconvenient time to die; he is busy preparing for battle! You could also contrast this response to the way Macduff reacts to the news that his family has been murdered in Act 3, Scene 3: Macduff is shocked and swears revenge. We find none of this passion in Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother - more positive - interpretation of Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s response could be that Macbeth is remarking that Lady Macbeth would have died eventually since their castle is under attack, or because everyone must die eventually. This interpretation suggests Macbeth is giving up, now that he has lost his loyal wife on top of most of his friends and followers. This sense of sadness and disillusion seems to be mirrored in Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s ensuing speech on how short life is and how little meaning it holds (5.5.21-30). Macbeth is entirely alone now and feels like fate has fooled him. To him, life \u0026ldquo;is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing.\u0026rdquo; (5.5.28-30).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo matter how we interpret Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s response to his wife\u0026rsquo;s suicide, Lady Macbeth and Macbeth do not die together like the lovers in \u003cem\u003eRomeo and Juliet\u003c/em\u003e. They both die \u003cstrong\u003ea lonely death\u003c/strong\u003e, riddled with guilt.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Characterisation of Lady Macbeth","MetaDescription":"In many ways, Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth is an ambiguous character.
