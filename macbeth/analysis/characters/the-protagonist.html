What we know about him is based on three things: what he does; what he says; and what others say about him. All these elements change over the course of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play. Note that there is no narrator in a play, unlike in short stories or novels.</p><p>We never learn anything about Macbeth&rsquo;s physical characteristics, but we hear of his inner characterisation before we first meet him, and it is all praise. In Act 1, Scene 2, a sergeant who has fought alongside Macbeth against a rebel army refers to him as &ldquo;brave Macbeth&rdquo; (1.2.18). Shortly after, King Duncan refers to him as &ldquo;valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!&rdquo; (1.2.26). Right from the start, we understand that <strong>Macbeth is a brave soldier, a nobleman, and the King&rsquo;s relative</strong>.</p><p>As we read on, the description of how fiercely Macbeth fought for his king and country reveals another characteristic: <strong>Macbeth is a warrior</strong>. When killing Macdonwald, the rebel leader, Macbeth &ldquo;unseam&rsquo;d him from the nave to the chops,/ And fix&rsquo;d his head upon [the] battlements.&rdquo; (1.2.24-25). This suggests that brutally killing people is no problem for Macbeth, at least when it happens in battle.</p><p>However, as we read on, we see <strong>a more reflective side of Macbeth&rsquo;s character</strong>. We finally meet him when he and Banquo encounter the witches. The very first words Macbeth speaks are: &ldquo;So foul and fair a day I have not seen.&rdquo; (1.3.39). This line tells us two important things about him. First, these words echo the words of the three witches when we first met them: &ldquo;Fair is foul, and foul is fair.&rdquo; (1.1.12). This suggests to us that Macbeth may already be influenced by their evil powers at this early stage.</p><p>Second, the line shows us a rather reflective side of Macbeth. Banquo is the one who reacts like a soldier to the witches&rsquo; prophecy: he remains calm and practical. In contrast, Macbeth seems stunned into silence by their prophecy, and from Banquo we learn that Macbeth looks scared: &ldquo;Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear/ Things that do sound so fair?&rdquo; (1.3.53-54). Already now, Macbeth seems to be thinking ahead, considering the potential consequences of the prophecy coming true. As well as being a soldier, <strong>he is also a thinker</strong>. On top of that, the witches&rsquo; prophecy has just provided him with a <strong>motive</strong> for killing his king: he believes he will gain ultimate power.</p><p>In Act 1, Scene 5, we see <strong>the private side of Macbeth</strong> as Lady Macbeth reads aloud a letter her husband has sent her where he lovingly refers to her as &ldquo;my dearest partner of greatness&rdquo; (1.5.11). Lady Macbeth broadens our understanding of Macbeth&rsquo;s character even further in the following soliloquy, which she addresses at her husband as if he were there:</p><blockquote><p>Yet do I fear thy nature,<br />It is too full o&rsquo; the milk of human kindness<br />To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;<br />Art not without ambition, but without<br />The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,<br />That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false. (1.5.16-21)</p></blockquote><p>Who knows a man better than his wife? Here Lady Macbeth is telling us that <strong>Macbeth is an ambitious man </strong>who desires greatness, but that<strong> he wants to achieve his victories in an honourable way</strong>. In Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s mind, this makes him weak, but she is more than ready to boost his bravery. You can read more about the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in our section on <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/analysis/characters/lady">the relationship between the two</a>.</p><p>The witches&rsquo; prophecy has planted a seed in Macbeth&rsquo;s mind. After having struggled with doubts about whether he should act upon the prophecy and accept the potential consequences of doing so, Macbeth finally agrees with his wife: they should murder King Duncan.</p><p>Act 2, Scene 1 is a good example of how <strong>he starts lying to others</strong>, thus becoming less honourable. When he meets Banquo in the dark, he presents himself as &ldquo;a friend&rdquo; (2.1.13), which seems questionable when he moves on to hint that Banquo will be rewarded if he allies himself with Macbeth in the future (2.1.31-32). Macbeth is already considering killing Duncan. He also lies to Banquo about not having thought about the prophecy at all (2.1.26).</p><p>When Macbeth murders Duncan, he gains ultimate power: he becomes King of Scotland. Ironically, this upward move politically starts a downward spiral for him morally. In the Elizabethan world picture, there was <strong>no greater sin than regicide</strong> - killing your king. A king was thought to be chosen by God, and anyone killing a king would be damned and go to Hell. Macbeth knows this: &ldquo;If the assassination/ Could trammel up the consequence.&rdquo; (1.7.2-3). Here, he wishes that completing the murder itself could somehow prevent any future consequences for him.</p><p>Immediately after the murder Macbeth is horrified at what he has done and riddled with <strong>guilt</strong>: &ldquo;Will all great Neptune&rsquo;s ocean wash this blood/ Clean from my hand?&rdquo; (2.2.75-76). Literally, his hands are stained with Duncan&rsquo;s blood, but metaphorically Macbeth <strong>also feels that his soul is stained</strong> with the sin of regicide. This is underlined by the fact that Macbeth felt unable to say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; when he heard someone saying a prayer in the dark (2.2.36-43). Despite now being king, <strong>he knows he is already doomed</strong>.</p><p>Like many other politicians, Macbeth soon learns that the real challenge is not to gain power but to keep it. <strong>His paranoia increases</strong>, partly due to the rumours of his guilt which Duncan&rsquo;s sons are spreading, and partly due to his fear that Banquo&rsquo;s prophecy will come true too. Therefore, he has Banquo murdered. The bloody dagger, which Macbeth sees before Duncan&rsquo;s murder, and Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, which Macbeth sees at his great banquet, may both be signs that Macbeth is starting to fall apart psychologically. <strong>He is haunted - in one sense or the other - by his guilt</strong>.</p><p>However, he knows that there is no turning back: &ldquo;I am in blood/ Stepp&rsquo;d in so far that, should I wade no more,/ Returning were as tedious as go o&rsquo;er.&rdquo; (3.4.159-161). In this quote, he compares his current situation to standing in the middle of a river of blood; he might as well go on now and keep killing. By the end of Act 3, Macbeth has become a &ldquo;tyrant&rdquo; (3.6.24), as Lennox puts it, who is ruining Scotland: there is no more talk of &ldquo;brave Macbeth&rdquo;. Despite being a brave warrior, <strong>Macbeth is actually ill suited for the psychological consequences of crime</strong>.</p><p>After speaking to the witches for the second time, Macbeth&rsquo;s fear of the future increases. At this point, he is sick with worrying and over-thinking: he declares that &ldquo;from this moment/ The very firstlings of my heart shall be/ The firstlings of my hand&rdquo; (4.1.164-165), meaning that <strong>he will now act without thinking about the consequences</strong>. He then decides on his first spontaneous murder: Macduff&rsquo;s family must be killed as a punishment for Macduff having fled to England.</p><p>The attack on&nbsp;the innocent Macduff family is the first murder by Macbeth that makes no sense logically; it is simply cruel. <strong>His pity seems to have disappeared along with his thinking</strong>. This is supported by the fact that the witches, in that same scene, say that &ldquo;something wicked this way comes&rdquo; (4.1.45) right before Macbeth enters the stage. This suggests that Macbeth has lost his humanity: he is &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; and nothing but a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;.</p><p>The rest of the play contains<strong> numerous negative references to Macbeth.</strong> The other characters now see him as &ldquo;black Macbeth&rdquo; (3.3.62), &ldquo;the fiend of Scotland&rdquo; (3.3.273), and a &ldquo;hell-hound&rdquo; (5.8.4). The very last reference to him in the play is when the conquering king, Malcolm, disdainfully calls him &ldquo;this dead butcher&rdquo; (5.9.41). Considering the praise surrounding Macbeth in the beginning, this description highlights the tragic ending and<strong> underlines the enormity of Macbeth&rsquo;s downfall</strong>.</p><p>However, to some extent <strong>Macbeth redeems himself to us before he dies</strong> because his conscience emerges again. When he meets Macduff on the battlefield, Macbeth does not want to kill him because, as Macbeth puts it, &ldquo;my soul is too much charged/ With blood of thine already.&rdquo; (5.8.6-7).</p><p>It is interesting to note that throughout the play <strong>Macbeth needs to be bullied into action: </strong>in the final battle, Macduff must insult him to make him fight, and prior to that Lady Macbeth needed to mock Macbeth&rsquo;s lack of manliness to spur him on to killing Duncan. Thus, the main character is capable of acting, but is<strong> often hesitant</strong>, possibly because he fears the consequences of his actions.</p><p>Another thing that redeems Macbeth towards the end is that his honour and bravery return as well, at least to some extent. Although he now realises that the witches have tricked him, Macbeth makes a final attempt to defy his fate and survive when he goes to fight Macduff. Therefore, at the end of the play Macbeth is back on the battlefield where we first met him. This also gives <strong>a circular structure </strong>to the play and to Macbeth&rsquo;s characterisation.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="ac3ebabb-e321-4a70-ae57-4055c8a261a7">Macbeth: a tragic hero with a tragic flaw</h2><p><em>Macbeth</em> is a tragedy in the classical sense, and all tragedies must end with the <strong>tragic hero</strong>&rsquo;s great downfall. The higher the position of the hero, the deeper the fall. The hero&rsquo;s defeat generally happens because of a failing in his character (a <strong>tragic flaw</strong>) and because he is destined for failure. Thus, it is not only fate but also the hero&rsquo;s own choices and actions which lead to his tragic end.</p><p>Sadly, the hero always fails to see his tragic flaw because of <strong>hubris</strong>, meaning that the hero suffers from arrogance and disrespect for the natural order of things. He simply believes he has the power to control his own fate, but the end of most tragedies indicates that no one can control their own fate.</p><p><em>Macbeth </em>fits all these requirements for tragedy. <strong>Macbeth&rsquo;s tragic flaw is his ambition</strong>. It is his lust for power that drives him to commit the ultimate sin and kill his king. And the same desire makes him go on killing in order to keep his power.</p><p><strong>Macbeth seems to believe that he can control his own fate</strong> and does not think that the witches&rsquo; prophecy will come true on its own, which we discuss in our paragraph on Fate versus Free will in <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/interpretation/themes">Themes</a>. When he learns that Duncan has made Malcolm his royal heir, Macbeth says: &ldquo;That is a step/ On which I must fall down, or else o&rsquo;erleap,/ For in my way it lies.&rdquo; (1.4.55-57). He is saying that unless he decides to actively do something about this (meaning, to kill Malcolm), his dreams of royalty will end here. On the one hand, Macbeth believes in the prophecy, but on the other hand, he tries to secure it by killing Duncan himself to become king and then Banquo, as he sees Banquo&rsquo;s line of heirs as a threat.</p><p>You could argue that it is <strong>arrogant</strong> of him to think that he can control fate - or to mistrust fate. He became thane of Cawdor without doing anything directly, so why, for example, does he seem to feel that he needs to act to become king? This is an example of <strong>Macbeth&rsquo;s hubris</strong>.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="29fef2d2-5e9f-406d-bb84-1cbb0179055a">Who is to blame for Macbeth&rsquo;s downfall?</h2><p>One of the most interesting questions in <em>Macbeth </em>is <strong>the question of responsibility</strong>. Who is to be blamed for Macbeth&rsquo;s tragic end?</p><p>We know that Macbeth is an ambitious man. His wife tells us so in her soliloquy (1.5.18-19), and the fact that he does not react to the witches&rsquo; prophecy with laughter or disbelief in Act 1, Scene 3 seems to suggest that he has already been playing with the idea of being king. It could be argued that <strong>Macbeth had the capacity to be evil all along</strong> - he just needed a catalyst or two to kick-start it.</p><p><strong>These catalysts come in the shape of the witches and Lady Macbeth</strong>. First the witches predict Macbeth&rsquo;s greatness and thereby plants a seed of thought in him. Then his wife follows this by boosting his ambition with her own. Macbeth does seem to realise that he will pay the price of eternal doom for gaining ultimate power in this life. It is probably a combination of his own ambition, Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s, and the witches&rsquo; prophecy, that drives him to act anyway. We discuss the role of women in relation to responsibility in our <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/interpretation/themes">Themes</a>&nbsp;section.</p><p>Another interesting question is how we interpret<strong> the supernatural elements </strong>of the play and Macbeth&rsquo;s reaction to them. If we choose to see the witches, the floating dagger, and Banquo&rsquo;s ghost as real, Macbeth to some extent becomes a victim of evil forces beyond his control. On the other hand, we could interpret these elements as <strong>psychological projections of Macbeth&rsquo;s inner desires and psychological breakdown</strong>. Meaning, he sees the witches because he <em>wants</em> to see them and is already planning on killing his king. This would make him more of a bad guy.</p><p>Many modern adaptations and readings of the play prefer the second of the two interpretations. However, you need to remember <strong>the historical context</strong>. Many Elizabethans believed in supernatural beings such as witches, ghosts and spirits. It was sometimes thought that evil actions were caused by being possessed by supernatural elements - just as we see Lady Macbeth inviting evil spirits to take over her body and &ldquo;unsex&rdquo; her in Act 1, Scene 5. These uncontrollable dark forces end up destroying her as well as her husband.</p><p>Where do you stand on this? Do we have free will or are we simply destined for certain things in life?</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="f1a1186b-2176-4c7f-8c85-d0377c8398b4">Do we feel sympathy with Macbeth?</h2><p>For any classical tragedy to work, the audience (or reader) <strong>needs to be able to feel sympathy with the tragic hero</strong> - even though that hero is flawed, suffers from a bad case of hubris, and generally tends to kill a lot of people.</p><p>As <em>Macbeth </em>develops, it becomes increasingly difficult to sympathise with the main character. Just to sum up, Macbeth has:</p><ul><li>Associated himself with evil beings (the witches).</li><li>Committed regicide. (Killing your king is the worst possible crime, and on top of that, King Duncan was also Macbeth&rsquo;s guest and relative).</li><li>Killed Duncan&rsquo;s drugged servants.</li><li>Usurped the throne, which sends Scotland into chaos.</li><li>Blamed Duncan&rsquo;s own sons for murdering their father.</li><li>Had his friend Banquo murdered.</li><li>Had Lady Macduff and her children murdered.</li></ul><p>So how does Shakespeare make us sympathise with Macbeth? First, he makes sure <strong>to shield us from actually witnessing Macbeth killing</strong> Duncan and Duncan&rsquo;s servants. The fact that it happens off stage means that it becomes easier for us to distance ourselves from it. We are also partly distanced from the murders of Banquo and Macduff&rsquo;s family, because these acts are committed by others acting on Macbeth&rsquo;s behalf.</p><p>Second, Shakespeare<strong> lets us inside Macbeth&rsquo;s mind</strong>. Macbeth is a thinker and a feeler, and whenever he tells other characters what he is feeling (such as in his dialogues with his wife) or when he addresses the audience in his soliloquies, we get an insight into his emotions and motives. One example is when he has just killed Duncan: Immediately, the focus is on Macbeth&rsquo;s horrified feelings at what he has had to do: &ldquo;I am afraid to think what I have done.&rdquo; (2.2.64). When Lady Macbeth starts criticising him for being weak, it encourages us to sympathise with Macbeth, even though we know he has just murdered a good man.</p><p>As we see Macbeth struggling with his own conscience, he remains human to us and not just a mindless killing machine. Also, we tend to like the idea that we can control our own fates, just like Macbeth tries to do. This makes us <strong>able to relate to him and his feelings</strong> and ensures our sympathy and sadness in the final scenes where he is killed by Macduff.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/macbeth/analysis/characters" title="Characters in Macbeth" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Characters</span></a><a href="/macbeth/analysis/characters/lady-macbeth" title="Characterisation of Lady Macbeth" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Lady Macbeth</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

What we know about him is based on three things: what he does; what he says; and what others say about him. All these elements change over the course of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s play. Note that there is no narrator in a play, unlike in short stories or novels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe never learn anything about Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s physical characteristics, but we hear of his inner characterisation before we first meet him, and it is all praise. In Act 1, Scene 2, a sergeant who has fought alongside Macbeth against a rebel army refers to him as \u0026ldquo;brave Macbeth\u0026rdquo; (1.2.18). Shortly after, King Duncan refers to him as \u0026ldquo;valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!\u0026rdquo; (1.2.26). Right from the start, we understand that \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth is a brave soldier, a nobleman, and the King\u0026rsquo;s relative\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we read on, the description of how fiercely Macbeth fought for his king and country reveals another characteristic: \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth is a warrior\u003c/strong\u003e. When killing Macdonwald, the rebel leader, Macbeth \u0026ldquo;unseam\u0026rsquo;d him from the nave to the chops,/ And fix\u0026rsquo;d his head upon [the] battlements.\u0026rdquo; (1.2.24-25). This suggests that brutally killing people is no problem for Macbeth, at least when it happens in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, as we read on, we see \u003cstrong\u003ea more reflective side of Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s character\u003c/strong\u003e. We finally meet him when he and Banquo encounter the witches. The very first words Macbeth speaks are: \u0026ldquo;So foul and fair a day I have not seen.\u0026rdquo; (1.3.39). This line tells us two important things about him. First, these words echo the words of the three witches when we first met them: \u0026ldquo;Fair is foul, and foul is fair.\u0026rdquo; (1.1.12). This suggests to us that Macbeth may already be influenced by their evil powers at this early stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, the line shows us a rather reflective side of Macbeth. Banquo is the one who reacts like a soldier to the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy: he remains calm and practical. In contrast, Macbeth seems stunned into silence by their prophecy, and from Banquo we learn that Macbeth looks scared: \u0026ldquo;Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear/ Things that do sound so fair?\u0026rdquo; (1.3.53-54). Already now, Macbeth seems to be thinking ahead, considering the potential consequences of the prophecy coming true. As well as being a soldier, \u003cstrong\u003ehe is also a thinker\u003c/strong\u003e. On top of that, the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy has just provided him with a \u003cstrong\u003emotive\u003c/strong\u003e for killing his king: he believes he will gain ultimate power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Act 1, Scene 5, we see \u003cstrong\u003ethe private side of Macbeth\u003c/strong\u003e as Lady Macbeth reads aloud a letter her husband has sent her where he lovingly refers to her as \u0026ldquo;my dearest partner of greatness\u0026rdquo; (1.5.11). Lady Macbeth broadens our understanding of Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s character even further in the following soliloquy, which she addresses at her husband as if he were there:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet do I fear thy nature,\u003cbr /\u003eIt is too full o\u0026rsquo; the milk of human kindness\u003cbr /\u003eTo catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;\u003cbr /\u003eArt not without ambition, but without\u003cbr /\u003eThe illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,\u003cbr /\u003eThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false. (1.5.16-21)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho knows a man better than his wife? Here Lady Macbeth is telling us that \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth is an ambitious man \u003c/strong\u003ewho desires greatness, but that\u003cstrong\u003e he wants to achieve his victories in an honourable way\u003c/strong\u003e. In Lady Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s mind, this makes him weak, but she is more than ready to boost his bravery. You can read more about the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in our section on \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/analysis/characters/lady\u0022\u003ethe relationship between the two\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy has planted a seed in Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s mind. After having struggled with doubts about whether he should act upon the prophecy and accept the potential consequences of doing so, Macbeth finally agrees with his wife: they should murder King Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAct 2, Scene 1 is a good example of how \u003cstrong\u003ehe starts lying to others\u003c/strong\u003e, thus becoming less honourable. When he meets Banquo in the dark, he presents himself as \u0026ldquo;a friend\u0026rdquo; (2.1.13), which seems questionable when he moves on to hint that Banquo will be rewarded if he allies himself with Macbeth in the future (2.1.31-32). Macbeth is already considering killing Duncan. He also lies to Banquo about not having thought about the prophecy at all (2.1.26).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Macbeth murders Duncan, he gains ultimate power: he becomes King of Scotland. Ironically, this upward move politically starts a downward spiral for him morally. In the Elizabethan world picture, there was \u003cstrong\u003eno greater sin than regicide\u003c/strong\u003e - killing your king. A king was thought to be chosen by God, and anyone killing a king would be damned and go to Hell. Macbeth knows this: \u0026ldquo;If the assassination/ Could trammel up the consequence.\u0026rdquo; (1.7.2-3). Here, he wishes that completing the murder itself could somehow prevent any future consequences for him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImmediately after the murder Macbeth is horrified at what he has done and riddled with \u003cstrong\u003eguilt\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;Will all great Neptune\u0026rsquo;s ocean wash this blood/ Clean from my hand?\u0026rdquo; (2.2.75-76). Literally, his hands are stained with Duncan\u0026rsquo;s blood, but metaphorically Macbeth \u003cstrong\u003ealso feels that his soul is stained\u003c/strong\u003e with the sin of regicide. This is underlined by the fact that Macbeth felt unable to say \u0026ldquo;amen\u0026rdquo; when he heard someone saying a prayer in the dark (2.2.36-43). Despite now being king, \u003cstrong\u003ehe knows he is already doomed\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike many other politicians, Macbeth soon learns that the real challenge is not to gain power but to keep it. \u003cstrong\u003eHis paranoia increases\u003c/strong\u003e, partly due to the rumours of his guilt which Duncan\u0026rsquo;s sons are spreading, and partly due to his fear that Banquo\u0026rsquo;s prophecy will come true too. Therefore, he has Banquo murdered. The bloody dagger, which Macbeth sees before Duncan\u0026rsquo;s murder, and Banquo\u0026rsquo;s ghost, which Macbeth sees at his great banquet, may both be signs that Macbeth is starting to fall apart psychologically. \u003cstrong\u003eHe is haunted - in one sense or the other - by his guilt\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, he knows that there is no turning back: \u0026ldquo;I am in blood/ Stepp\u0026rsquo;d in so far that, should I wade no more,/ Returning were as tedious as go o\u0026rsquo;er.\u0026rdquo; (3.4.159-161). In this quote, he compares his current situation to standing in the middle of a river of blood; he might as well go on now and keep killing. By the end of Act 3, Macbeth has become a \u0026ldquo;tyrant\u0026rdquo; (3.6.24), as Lennox puts it, who is ruining Scotland: there is no more talk of \u0026ldquo;brave Macbeth\u0026rdquo;. Despite being a brave warrior, \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth is actually ill suited for the psychological consequences of crime\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter speaking to the witches for the second time, Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s fear of the future increases. At this point, he is sick with worrying and over-thinking: he declares that \u0026ldquo;from this moment/ The very firstlings of my heart shall be/ The firstlings of my hand\u0026rdquo; (4.1.164-165), meaning that \u003cstrong\u003ehe will now act without thinking about the consequences\u003c/strong\u003e. He then decides on his first spontaneous murder: Macduff\u0026rsquo;s family must be killed as a punishment for Macduff having fled to England.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attack on\u0026nbsp;the innocent Macduff family is the first murder by Macbeth that makes no sense logically; it is simply cruel. \u003cstrong\u003eHis pity seems to have disappeared along with his thinking\u003c/strong\u003e. This is supported by the fact that the witches, in that same scene, say that \u0026ldquo;something wicked this way comes\u0026rdquo; (4.1.45) right before Macbeth enters the stage. This suggests that Macbeth has lost his humanity: he is \u0026ldquo;wicked\u0026rdquo; and nothing but a \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the play contains\u003cstrong\u003e numerous negative references to Macbeth.\u003c/strong\u003e The other characters now see him as \u0026ldquo;black Macbeth\u0026rdquo; (3.3.62), \u0026ldquo;the fiend of Scotland\u0026rdquo; (3.3.273), and a \u0026ldquo;hell-hound\u0026rdquo; (5.8.4). The very last reference to him in the play is when the conquering king, Malcolm, disdainfully calls him \u0026ldquo;this dead butcher\u0026rdquo; (5.9.41). Considering the praise surrounding Macbeth in the beginning, this description highlights the tragic ending and\u003cstrong\u003e underlines the enormity of Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s downfall\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, to some extent \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth redeems himself to us before he dies\u003c/strong\u003e because his conscience emerges again. When he meets Macduff on the battlefield, Macbeth does not want to kill him because, as Macbeth puts it, \u0026ldquo;my soul is too much charged/ With blood of thine already.\u0026rdquo; (5.8.6-7).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is interesting to note that throughout the play \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth needs to be bullied into action: \u003c/strong\u003ein the final battle, Macduff must insult him to make him fight, and prior to that Lady Macbeth needed to mock Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s lack of manliness to spur him on to killing Duncan. Thus, the main character is capable of acting, but is\u003cstrong\u003e often hesitant\u003c/strong\u003e, possibly because he fears the consequences of his actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing that redeems Macbeth towards the end is that his honour and bravery return as well, at least to some extent. Although he now realises that the witches have tricked him, Macbeth makes a final attempt to defy his fate and survive when he goes to fight Macduff. Therefore, at the end of the play Macbeth is back on the battlefield where we first met him. This also gives \u003cstrong\u003ea circular structure \u003c/strong\u003eto the play and to Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s characterisation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ac3ebabb-e321-4a70-ae57-4055c8a261a7\u0022\u003eMacbeth: a tragic hero with a tragic flaw\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMacbeth\u003c/em\u003e is a tragedy in the classical sense, and all tragedies must end with the \u003cstrong\u003etragic hero\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026rsquo;s great downfall. The higher the position of the hero, the deeper the fall. The hero\u0026rsquo;s defeat generally happens because of a failing in his character (a \u003cstrong\u003etragic flaw\u003c/strong\u003e) and because he is destined for failure. Thus, it is not only fate but also the hero\u0026rsquo;s own choices and actions which lead to his tragic end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSadly, the hero always fails to see his tragic flaw because of \u003cstrong\u003ehubris\u003c/strong\u003e, meaning that the hero suffers from arrogance and disrespect for the natural order of things. He simply believes he has the power to control his own fate, but the end of most tragedies indicates that no one can control their own fate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003efits all these requirements for tragedy. \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth\u0026rsquo;s tragic flaw is his ambition\u003c/strong\u003e. It is his lust for power that drives him to commit the ultimate sin and kill his king. And the same desire makes him go on killing in order to keep his power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth seems to believe that he can control his own fate\u003c/strong\u003e and does not think that the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy will come true on its own, which we discuss in our paragraph on Fate versus Free will in \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/interpretation/themes\u0022\u003eThemes\u003c/a\u003e. When he learns that Duncan has made Malcolm his royal heir, Macbeth says: \u0026ldquo;That is a step/ On which I must fall down, or else o\u0026rsquo;erleap,/ For in my way it lies.\u0026rdquo; (1.4.55-57). He is saying that unless he decides to actively do something about this (meaning, to kill Malcolm), his dreams of royalty will end here. On the one hand, Macbeth believes in the prophecy, but on the other hand, he tries to secure it by killing Duncan himself to become king and then Banquo, as he sees Banquo\u0026rsquo;s line of heirs as a threat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou could argue that it is \u003cstrong\u003earrogant\u003c/strong\u003e of him to think that he can control fate - or to mistrust fate. He became thane of Cawdor without doing anything directly, so why, for example, does he seem to feel that he needs to act to become king? This is an example of \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth\u0026rsquo;s hubris\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002229fef2d2-5e9f-406d-bb84-1cbb0179055a\u0022\u003eWho is to blame for Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s downfall?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most interesting questions in \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003eis \u003cstrong\u003ethe question of responsibility\u003c/strong\u003e. Who is to be blamed for Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s tragic end?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe know that Macbeth is an ambitious man. His wife tells us so in her soliloquy (1.5.18-19), and the fact that he does not react to the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy with laughter or disbelief in Act 1, Scene 3 seems to suggest that he has already been playing with the idea of being king. It could be argued that \u003cstrong\u003eMacbeth had the capacity to be evil all along\u003c/strong\u003e - he just needed a catalyst or two to kick-start it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese catalysts come in the shape of the witches and Lady Macbeth\u003c/strong\u003e. First the witches predict Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s greatness and thereby plants a seed of thought in him. Then his wife follows this by boosting his ambition with her own. Macbeth does seem to realise that he will pay the price of eternal doom for gaining ultimate power in this life. It is probably a combination of his own ambition, Lady Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s, and the witches\u0026rsquo; prophecy, that drives him to act anyway. We discuss the role of women in relation to responsibility in our \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/macbeth/interpretation/themes\u0022\u003eThemes\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;section.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother interesting question is how we interpret\u003cstrong\u003e the supernatural elements \u003c/strong\u003eof the play and Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s reaction to them. If we choose to see the witches, the floating dagger, and Banquo\u0026rsquo;s ghost as real, Macbeth to some extent becomes a victim of evil forces beyond his control. On the other hand, we could interpret these elements as \u003cstrong\u003epsychological projections of Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s inner desires and psychological breakdown\u003c/strong\u003e. Meaning, he sees the witches because he \u003cem\u003ewants\u003c/em\u003e to see them and is already planning on killing his king. This would make him more of a bad guy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany modern adaptations and readings of the play prefer the second of the two interpretations. However, you need to remember \u003cstrong\u003ethe historical context\u003c/strong\u003e. Many Elizabethans believed in supernatural beings such as witches, ghosts and spirits. It was sometimes thought that evil actions were caused by being possessed by supernatural elements - just as we see Lady Macbeth inviting evil spirits to take over her body and \u0026ldquo;unsex\u0026rdquo; her in Act 1, Scene 5. These uncontrollable dark forces end up destroying her as well as her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere do you stand on this? Do we have free will or are we simply destined for certain things in life?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f1a1186b-2176-4c7f-8c85-d0377c8398b4\u0022\u003eDo we feel sympathy with Macbeth?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor any classical tragedy to work, the audience (or reader) \u003cstrong\u003eneeds to be able to feel sympathy with the tragic hero\u003c/strong\u003e - even though that hero is flawed, suffers from a bad case of hubris, and generally tends to kill a lot of people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs \u003cem\u003eMacbeth \u003c/em\u003edevelops, it becomes increasingly difficult to sympathise with the main character. Just to sum up, Macbeth has:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAssociated himself with evil beings (the witches).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommitted regicide. (Killing your king is the worst possible crime, and on top of that, King Duncan was also Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s guest and relative).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKilled Duncan\u0026rsquo;s drugged servants.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsurped the throne, which sends Scotland into chaos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBlamed Duncan\u0026rsquo;s own sons for murdering their father.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHad his friend Banquo murdered.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHad Lady Macduff and her children murdered.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo how does Shakespeare make us sympathise with Macbeth? First, he makes sure \u003cstrong\u003eto shield us from actually witnessing Macbeth killing\u003c/strong\u003e Duncan and Duncan\u0026rsquo;s servants. The fact that it happens off stage means that it becomes easier for us to distance ourselves from it. We are also partly distanced from the murders of Banquo and Macduff\u0026rsquo;s family, because these acts are committed by others acting on Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, Shakespeare\u003cstrong\u003e lets us inside Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s mind\u003c/strong\u003e. Macbeth is a thinker and a feeler, and whenever he tells other characters what he is feeling (such as in his dialogues with his wife) or when he addresses the audience in his soliloquies, we get an insight into his emotions and motives. One example is when he has just killed Duncan: Immediately, the focus is on Macbeth\u0026rsquo;s horrified feelings at what he has had to do: \u0026ldquo;I am afraid to think what I have done.\u0026rdquo; (2.2.64). When Lady Macbeth starts criticising him for being weak, it encourages us to sympathise with Macbeth, even though we know he has just murdered a good man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we see Macbeth struggling with his own conscience, he remains human to us and not just a mindless killing machine. Also, we tend to like the idea that we can control our own fates, just like Macbeth tries to do. This makes us \u003cstrong\u003eable to relate to him and his feelings\u003c/strong\u003e and ensures our sympathy and sadness in the final scenes where he is killed by Macduff.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Characterisation of Macbeth","MetaDescription":"The main character of Shakespeare’s Macbeth is the nobleman and warrior Macbeth.
