When she married husband William Cochran, she took his last name but added an &ldquo;e&rdquo; to the end. And when she realized no one had yet created a proper automatic dishwasher, she invented one herself!</p><p>Josephine led a comfortable life in Shelbyville, Illinois. William was a successful businessman, and the couple often held dinner parties in their large home. She even had servants to clean up afterward. But one morning after a party, she found some of her good china had gotten chipped.</p><p>She was so upset, she decided to wash the dishes herself from then on. It wasn&rsquo;t long before Josephine wondered why no one had invented a machine to do the job &hellip; and soon she had sketched out the idea that would become the first commercially successful automatic dishwasher.&nbsp;</p><p>Her design used water pressure to clean, just as today&rsquo;s dishwashers do. It had wire compartments for the dishes, which fit into a wheel inside a copper boiler. A motor turned the wheel while soapy water sprayed onto the dishes. It was practical, but Josephine had a hard time trying to hire a mechanic to build her machine the way she wanted, instead of insisting on building it HIS way. She finally found a man named George Butters to work with, and the Garis-Cochran Dish-Washing Machine was patented in 1886, three years after her husband died.&nbsp;</p><p>Josephine thought her invention would appeal to other housewives, but it was more of a hit with hotels and restaurants, maybe because it was an expensive appliance for a regular family to buy. She opened her own factory in 1897, and personally sold her machines nearly up until her death in 1913. In 1926, her company was bought by Hobart, which eventually became the modern appliance giant KitchenAid.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:right;">www.kidsdiscover.com</p><h3 title="ID: heading-ol8kl" id="heading-cc63b">Subiectul I</h3><p>1.

A commenter's response to it went viral: &ldquo;Schools making it mandatory for kids to have Internet access to do homework is just another way for poor kids to get left behind and continue the cycle of generational poverty. I&rsquo;m bothered.&rdquo; With over 185,000 retweets, the message clearly struck a nerve about the extreme lengths students sometimes have to go to complete basic educational responsibilities.</p><p>According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report, nearly one in five students lack a high-speed Internet connection at home. [&hellip;] And education experts interviewed by Teen Vogue say that Internet connectivity is just one of many issues creating a digital divide among students. According to Roxanne Garza, a senior policy analyst for educator quality at New America and Kristina Ishmael, senior project manager for the teaching, learning, and tech program at the same foundation, broadband connectivity needs to be addressed in concert with providing enough devices for efficient student access and requiring teacher training to incorporate digital skills into their classrooms and homes.</p><p>Without all of these pieces, schools, teachers, and students are left trying to decide if and when to incorporate digital learning. Educators lacking this needed support, Garza says, are put in the difficult position of deciding whether or not to assign homework knowing students cannot complete it. &ldquo;There's like a level of unfairness there...and then there's the decision to not assign because of that unfairness...and it's like choosing the least awful choice out there," she said.</p><p>While the issue of Internet connectivity gets most of the attention, it is this combination of factors and difficult decisions that Garza says presents the biggest problem. Whether it's a lack of computers or even basic physical resources like textbooks, the challenges force students to jump through hoops in order to complete assignments. "I've seen a lot of high school students type<br>papers with their thumbs...I saw a student sitting in front of me on the Metro here in D.C. who had taken pictures of a textbook page on their phone so they could read it because they didn't have another way to access [it]," Ishmael said. According to Garza, a lack of digital skills can translate to lower levels of academic achievement and lower test scores: "We all have experienced by now<br>that being comfortable in a digital environment is key to being successful."</p><p>Shandiin Herrera, 22, is all too familiar with the struggles that Garza and Ishmael describe. Herrera grew up on the Navajo Nation reservation in Monument Valley on the Arizona/Utah border, commuting to school over 20 miles away in Kayenta, Arizona. Growing up, she lived in a household without broadband access, and little cell service. The same was true for most people<br>in her community, she told Teen Vogue.</p><p>While a young student, this did not present huge challenges. But when she began to research summer schools off the reservation, she ran into trouble. "Every application was online at that point so I'd either have to ask a teacher to stay later that day...Even being on the computer was hard because I didn't know how to navigate since I didn't grow up with it."&nbsp;</p><p>Herrera said that these are systemic issues in many communities like hers. "I was very fortunate to have a mother who is a high school guidance counsellor so I would go to her office like an evening with her, or something...but that was not the case for many of my peers," she said.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Herrera was able to pursue higher education, graduating from Duke University this past May. But her lack of familiarity with technology and her inability to pay for devices made completing regular assignments difficult. "I didn't have a laptop throughout high school, but when I got on campus everyone had laptops," she recalled. The Internet was required<br>to submit homework, to check grades, to e-mail professors.</p><p>These are the kinds of experiences that many low-income students and students of colour face every day. "I remember going back and forth with a professor because I had an assignment due and not having Internet that day, and her just not even understanding... I had to learn how to navigate challenges throughout college, and to advocate not only on my own behalf, but for other<br>native students who go back to rural communities," Herrera said.</p><p>Herrera&rsquo;s story speaks to the fact that the digital divide cannot be separated from other inequities that the country&rsquo;s most at-risk communities face. "As long as we continue to dramatically underfund certain schools, I don&rsquo;t know that developing digital skills is going to be considered a top priority...but it should be," Garza says.</p><p style="text-align:right;"><a href="https://liceunet.ro/bacalaureat/engleza/2023/model-de-subiect/www.teenvogue.com">www.teenvogue.com</a></p><p>1.

You have decided to write an essay for your teacher presenting both sides of the argument. Write your essay in 180 - 200 words.</p><p><strong>Răspuns:</strong></p><p>In my opinion, growing up in a big city is jam-packed with both advantages and disadvantages. If you ask me personally, I am glad I grew up partly in the countryside and partly in a smaller town. Big cities are a bit too much for a young child without proper guidance.</p><p>The good part of growing up in a big city is that you kind of get used to making new acquaintances easier. They&rsquo;re made in a such a way that you&rsquo;re practically forced to interact with new people almost every day.</p><p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s much harder to form genuine connections in big cities due to their very nature. You don&rsquo;t have the same group stability and tribe mentality that small towns or rural areas offer. As a result, you become more independent yet atomized.

When she married husband William Cochran, she took his last name but added an \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; to the end. And when she realized no one had yet created a proper automatic dishwasher, she invented one herself!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJosephine led a comfortable life in Shelbyville, Illinois. William was a successful businessman, and the couple often held dinner parties in their large home. She even had servants to clean up afterward. But one morning after a party, she found some of her good china had gotten chipped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe was so upset, she decided to wash the dishes herself from then on. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before Josephine wondered why no one had invented a machine to do the job \u0026hellip; and soon she had sketched out the idea that would become the first commercially successful automatic dishwasher.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer design used water pressure to clean, just as today\u0026rsquo;s dishwashers do. It had wire compartments for the dishes, which fit into a wheel inside a copper boiler. A motor turned the wheel while soapy water sprayed onto the dishes. It was practical, but Josephine had a hard time trying to hire a mechanic to build her machine the way she wanted, instead of insisting on building it HIS way.

A commenter\u0027s response to it went viral: \u0026ldquo;Schools making it mandatory for kids to have Internet access to do homework is just another way for poor kids to get left behind and continue the cycle of generational poverty. I\u0026rsquo;m bothered.\u0026rdquo; With over 185,000 retweets, the message clearly struck a nerve about the extreme lengths students sometimes have to go to complete basic educational responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to a 2018 Pew Research Center report, nearly one in five students lack a high-speed Internet connection at home. [\u0026hellip;] And education experts interviewed by Teen Vogue say that Internet connectivity is just one of many issues creating a digital divide among students. According to Roxanne Garza, a senior policy analyst for educator quality at New America and Kristina Ishmael, senior project manager for the teaching, learning, and tech program at the same foundation, broadband connectivity needs to be addressed in concert with providing enough devices for efficient student access and requiring teacher training to incorporate digital skills into their classrooms and homes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout all of these pieces, schools, teachers, and students are left trying to decide if and when to incorporate digital learning. Educators lacking this needed support, Garza says, are put in the difficult position of deciding whether or not to assign homework knowing students cannot complete it. \u0026ldquo;There\u0027s like a level of unfairness there...and then there\u0027s the decision to not assign because of that unfairness...and it\u0027s like choosing the least awful choice out there,\u0022 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the issue of Internet connectivity gets most of the attention, it is this combination of factors and difficult decisions that Garza says presents the biggest problem. Whether it\u0027s a lack of computers or even basic physical resources like textbooks, the challenges force students to jump through hoops in order to complete assignments. \u0022I\u0027ve seen a lot of high school students type\u003cbr\u003epapers with their thumbs...I saw a student sitting in front of me on the Metro here in D.C. who had taken pictures of a textbook page on their phone so they could read it because they didn\u0027t have another way to access [it],\u0022 Ishmael said. According to Garza, a lack of digital skills can translate to lower levels of academic achievement and lower test scores: \u0022We all have experienced by now\u003cbr\u003ethat being comfortable in a digital environment is key to being successful.\u0022\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShandiin Herrera, 22, is all too familiar with the struggles that Garza and Ishmael describe. Herrera grew up on the Navajo Nation reservation in Monument Valley on the Arizona/Utah border, commuting to school over 20 miles away in Kayenta, Arizona. Growing up, she lived in a household without broadband access, and little cell service. The same was true for most people\u003cbr\u003ein her community, she told Teen Vogue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile a young student, this did not present huge challenges. But when she began to research summer schools off the reservation, she ran into trouble. \u0022Every application was online at that point so I\u0027d either have to ask a teacher to stay later that day...Even being on the computer was hard because I didn\u0027t know how to navigate since I didn\u0027t grow up with it.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHerrera said that these are systemic issues in many communities like hers. \u0022I was very fortunate to have a mother who is a high school guidance counsellor so I would go to her office like an evening with her, or something...but that was not the case for many of my peers,\u0022 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite these challenges, Herrera was able to pursue higher education, graduating from Duke University this past May. But her lack of familiarity with technology and her inability to pay for devices made completing regular assignments difficult. \u0022I didn\u0027t have a laptop throughout high school, but when I got on campus everyone had laptops,\u0022 she recalled. The Internet was required\u003cbr\u003eto submit homework, to check grades, to e-mail professors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are the kinds of experiences that many low-income students and students of colour face every day. \u0022I remember going back and forth with a professor because I had an assignment due and not having Internet that day, and her just not even understanding... I had to learn how to navigate challenges throughout college, and to advocate not only on my own behalf, but for other\u003cbr\u003enative students who go back to rural communities,\u0022 Herrera said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHerrera\u0026rsquo;s story speaks to the fact that the digital divide cannot be separated from other inequities that the country\u0026rsquo;s most at-risk communities face. \u0022As long as we continue to dramatically underfund certain schools, I don\u0026rsquo;t know that developing digital skills is going to be considered a top priority...but it should be,\u0022 Garza says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\u0022text-align:right;\u0022\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022www.teenvogue.com\u0022\u003ewww.teenvogue.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.
