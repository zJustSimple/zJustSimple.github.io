Different people have different taste, and various types of music have many ways of leaving an impact on someone. It can be relaxing, angering, soothing, energizing, and many more.</p><p>There are so many types of music out there today. Rap, pop, rock, country, indie, alternative, hardcore are some of the abundant types in the world. Music sends out either good or bad messages that have a big impact on how people act. People usually become friends with others who have the same taste in music as the rest of the people they hang out with. People may not want to associate with people who have different tastes in music because they&rsquo;ll argue about it.</p><p>Rap and Rock music are two very important types of music in the world. They both send out different messages and help kids. The lyrics sung or rapped by the artists can be things going on in their own personal lives. People with the same types of problems can listen to them so they know there&rsquo;s hope and there are similar people out there in the world.</p><p>Music can also serve as a catalyst for new ideas. When people listen to the new things out there, they learn different things going on in the world and they become more open-minded.</p><p>People can use music to express themselves, in ways it can&rsquo;t be expressed through behaviour, or art. You can usually tell how someone&rsquo;s feeling by the type of music he or she is listening to at the time. It&rsquo;s a tool used by many. Groups of people around the world can come together and gather at concerts, shows, and venues to show what their interests and likes are.</p><p>I can personally relate to the effects that music has on its listeners and users because it&rsquo;s a big part of my life. Every day I listen to the words and sounds of different singers/bands with contrasting ideas and opinions.

For questions 1-10, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text.</p><p>A brief history of the UK Parliament</p><p>Parliament started life as an English affair. It was not much of a Parliament - more of a talking shop for the king and rich men. The king asked their advice, but did what he wanted. These meetings morphed into a formal arrangement which eventually became the House of Lords. In those days - and for several centuries later - England was busy fighting with Scotland and raiding<br />Wales.</p><p>By the 13th Century, a parliament was when kings met up with English barons to raise cash for fighting wars - mostly against Scotland. Thanks to Magna Carta of 1215, kings were now obliged to ask before taking anyone's money. That did not stop the rows though. Some barons got fed up with Henry III - not least because of his failed, expensive battles in Wales. The ambitious Simon de Montfort sidelined Henry and made himself ruler. De Montfort was a big fan of<br />Parliament. The one in 1265 was the first to involve "ordinary" folk - knights, not just the super-rich. And it was the first time elections were held - the first stirrings of the House of Commons we know today. The venue was usually Westminster, where one enterprising monarch had built a massive hall on a swamp, which grew into the Palace of Westminster. Westminster Hall is still in use today.</p><p>Scotland had its own parliament from the 13th century, which was occasionally held in open air. In those days, though, the king had the real power. So one of the early campaigns for independence was sparked by an English king declaring himself king of Scotland. William Wallace led the rebellion. In those days campaign weapons were bows and arrows. Wallace was eventually found guilty of treason. He was dragged through the streets of London naked before being hanged, drawn and quartered.</p><p>In the early days there were no rules on who could vote. But a feeling developed that too many "persons of low estate" were doing so. So from 1430 you could only vote if you owned property worth 40 shillings. The rule stayed in place for 400 years. Ireland also had its own parliament from the 13th Century. In 1542, Irish MPs decided that whoever was king of England should also be king of Ireland. They kept their parliament going though.</p><p>The seeds of a UK Parliament were sown in 1542 when Wales came on board. At the time, Wales was a patchwork of independent areas. But along came Henry VIII, a man fond of dramatic gestures. Having given the Catholic Church its marching orders, he was worried that the Catholics would not go quietly. To stop the Welsh coming under their influence, he decided Wales would be<br />ruled by England. By now Parliament was a full-blooded institution and Wales was allowed to send representatives. Henry called it an Act of Union but it was more of a forced marriage.</p><p>By 1603, England and Scotland had the same king but different parliaments. King James tried to persuade the English Parliament to bring the Scottish Parliament into the fold. But English MPs refused to let any Scots into the Westminster club.</p><p>The Commons got into its stride in the 1620s. Fights in the chamber... the king trying to arrest MPs. Eventually, Charles I dissolved Parliament for 11 years. He brought it back because he was short of money for a war with... Scotland. The rows got worse, leading to a war between Parliament and the king. The king was put on trial and then executed. Hard to imagine nowadays but the Commons voted to abolish the monarchy altogether.</p><p>After the civil war, England became a republic under Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell had big ideas. He annexed Scotland and Ireland into a full union with a single parliament at Westminster. The 1654 parliament was the first one in which the whole of Britain was represented. But Cromwell dissolved it pretty quickly when MPs refused to do his <strong>bidding</strong>.</p><p>At the end of the 18th Century, there was a powerful campaign for Irish independence from England. The English response? To crush the rebellion brutally and bring Ireland firmly into the UK with another Act of Union. That was the end of the Irish Parliament. A hundred Irish MPs turned up<br />at Westminster. By now, the Commons chamber was getting pretty crowded.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a succession of rebellions in Ireland, throughout the 19th Century, against Britain. Moderate rebels settled on "Home Rule" as the way forward - which included bringing back an Irish Parliament. Just as the Westminster Parliament looked set to agree, World War One broke out. Finally in 1920 - after a rebellion which became a civil war - a law was passed dividing Ireland<br />into north and south. Northern Ireland was given its own parliament, which was suspended in 1972 because of the Troubles. The south became a new independent Irish state. And, of course, this arrangement was fiercely controversial for most of the 20th Century.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;www.bbc.com</p><p>1.

That man was none other than Walt Disney, founder of the now worldwide-renowned company. I used to have my doubts regarding this subject, but having such a statement come from someone like him gave me hope.</p><p>During my life, I have had several big dreams about what I wanted to do, but they all came and went when I started growing older and more pessimistic about the world in general and about how others view me, but what Walt said had the power to change my perspective. Seeing his life story and what he went through made me realise that he was right.</p><p>I truly believe dreams can come true and that everyone, without exception, can achieve greatness. It might take a lot of work, it might mean that we have to jump through a lot of hoops, but in the end, by giving the best we have and never giving up, we can go places that we never even imagined.

Different people have different taste, and various types of music have many ways of leaving an impact on someone. It can be relaxing, angering, soothing, energizing, and many more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are so many types of music out there today. Rap, pop, rock, country, indie, alternative, hardcore are some of the abundant types in the world. Music sends out either good or bad messages that have a big impact on how people act. People usually become friends with others who have the same taste in music as the rest of the people they hang out with. People may not want to associate with people who have different tastes in music because they\u0026rsquo;ll argue about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRap and Rock music are two very important types of music in the world. They both send out different messages and help kids. The lyrics sung or rapped by the artists can be things going on in their own personal lives. People with the same types of problems can listen to them so they know there\u0026rsquo;s hope and there are similar people out there in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMusic can also serve as a catalyst for new ideas. When people listen to the new things out there, they learn different things going on in the world and they become more open-minded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople can use music to express themselves, in ways it can\u0026rsquo;t be expressed through behaviour, or art. You can usually tell how someone\u0026rsquo;s feeling by the type of music he or she is listening to at the time. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool used by many. Groups of people around the world can come together and gather at concerts, shows, and venues to show what their interests and likes are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can personally relate to the effects that music has on its listeners and users because it\u0026rsquo;s a big part of my life. Every day I listen to the words and sounds of different singers/bands with contrasting ideas and opinions.

It was not much of a Parliament - more of a talking shop for the king and rich men. The king asked their advice, but did what he wanted. These meetings morphed into a formal arrangement which eventually became the House of Lords. In those days - and for several centuries later - England was busy fighting with Scotland and raiding\u003cbr /\u003eWales.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the 13th Century, a parliament was when kings met up with English barons to raise cash for fighting wars - mostly against Scotland. Thanks to Magna Carta of 1215, kings were now obliged to ask before taking anyone\u0027s money. That did not stop the rows though. Some barons got fed up with Henry III - not least because of his failed, expensive battles in Wales. The ambitious Simon de Montfort sidelined Henry and made himself ruler. De Montfort was a big fan of\u003cbr /\u003eParliament. The one in 1265 was the first to involve \u0022ordinary\u0022 folk - knights, not just the super-rich. And it was the first time elections were held - the first stirrings of the House of Commons we know today. The venue was usually Westminster, where one enterprising monarch had built a massive hall on a swamp, which grew into the Palace of Westminster. Westminster Hall is still in use today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScotland had its own parliament from the 13th century, which was occasionally held in open air. In those days, though, the king had the real power. So one of the early campaigns for independence was sparked by an English king declaring himself king of Scotland. William Wallace led the rebellion. In those days campaign weapons were bows and arrows. Wallace was eventually found guilty of treason. He was dragged through the streets of London naked before being hanged, drawn and quartered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the early days there were no rules on who could vote. But a feeling developed that too many \u0022persons of low estate\u0022 were doing so. So from 1430 you could only vote if you owned property worth 40 shillings. The rule stayed in place for 400 years. Ireland also had its own parliament from the 13th Century. In 1542, Irish MPs decided that whoever was king of England should also be king of Ireland. They kept their parliament going though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe seeds of a UK Parliament were sown in 1542 when Wales came on board. At the time, Wales was a patchwork of independent areas. But along came Henry VIII, a man fond of dramatic gestures. Having given the Catholic Church its marching orders, he was worried that the Catholics would not go quietly. To stop the Welsh coming under their influence, he decided Wales would be\u003cbr /\u003eruled by England. By now Parliament was a full-blooded institution and Wales was allowed to send representatives. Henry called it an Act of Union but it was more of a forced marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 1603, England and Scotland had the same king but different parliaments. King James tried to persuade the English Parliament to bring the Scottish Parliament into the fold. But English MPs refused to let any Scots into the Westminster club.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Commons got into its stride in the 1620s. Fights in the chamber... the king trying to arrest MPs. Eventually, Charles I dissolved Parliament for 11 years. He brought it back because he was short of money for a war with... Scotland. The rows got worse, leading to a war between Parliament and the king. The king was put on trial and then executed. Hard to imagine nowadays but the Commons voted to abolish the monarchy altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the civil war, England became a republic under Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell had big ideas. He annexed Scotland and Ireland into a full union with a single parliament at Westminster. The 1654 parliament was the first one in which the whole of Britain was represented. But Cromwell dissolved it pretty quickly when MPs refused to do his \u003cstrong\u003ebidding\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the 18th Century, there was a powerful campaign for Irish independence from England. The English response? To crush the rebellion brutally and bring Ireland firmly into the UK with another Act of Union. That was the end of the Irish Parliament. A hundred Irish MPs turned up\u003cbr /\u003eat Westminster. By now, the Commons chamber was getting pretty crowded.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was a succession of rebellions in Ireland, throughout the 19th Century, against Britain. Moderate rebels settled on \u0022Home Rule\u0022 as the way forward - which included bringing back an Irish Parliament. Just as the Westminster Parliament looked set to agree, World War One broke out. Finally in 1920 - after a rebellion which became a civil war - a law was passed dividing Ireland\u003cbr /\u003einto north and south. Northern Ireland was given its own parliament, which was suspended in 1972 because of the Troubles. The south became a new independent Irish state. And, of course, this arrangement was fiercely controversial for most of the 20th Century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;www.bbc.com\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.
