Mark A, B or C on your exam sheet.</p><p>Great Britain is an island in the northwest part of Europe. It is the biggest island on the continent, located just off the shore of France, west of the Netherlands, and north of Spain. Great Britain is part of the sovereign state called the United Kingdom, and contains three of its four countries: England, Scotland, and Wales. England, the biggest part of the island, is in the southeast, and its capital city is London, which is also the capital of the United Kingdom. Scotland is to the north of England, and its capital is Edinburgh. Wales is to the west of England, and its capital is Cardiff. Great Britain is not the name of the country itself. Many people call the UK 'England' or "Great Britain", and British people who do not live in these areas may not like it if other people make this mistake.</p><p>West of Great Britain is a smaller island called Ireland. Ireland contains the Republic of Ireland, which is a country in itself, as well as Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is not a part of the island of Great Britain, but it is part of the United Kingdom. This is why Great Britain is not the same as the United Kingdom, because Northern Ireland, which is one of its four constituent countries, is not part of Great Britain. Together with some other islands, Ireland and Great Britain form the British Isles.</p><p>The political union that joined the kingdoms of England and Scotland happened in 1707 when the Acts of Union ratified the 1706 Treaty of Union and merged the parliaments of the two nations, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain, which covered the entire island. Before this, a personal union had existed between these two countries since the 1603 Union of the Crowns under James VI of Scotland and I of England. That union was called the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, Ireland joined up with Great Britain, which made one country called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish Free State left the United Kingdom in 1922.</p><p style="text-align:right;">(https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain)</p><p>1. Great Britain contains three countries.</p><p>A.

For questions 1-10, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text.</p><p>Some 95% of teens now say they have or have access to a smartphone, which represents a 22- percentage-point increase from the 73% of teens who said this in 2014-2015. Smartphone ownership is nearly universal among teens of different genders, races and ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. A more nuanced story emerges when it comes to teens&rsquo; access to computers. While 88% of teens report having access to a desktop or laptop computer at home, access varies greatly by income level. Fully 96% of teens from households with an annual income of $75,000 or more per year say they have access to a computer at home, but that share falls to 75% among those from households earning less than $30,000 a year. Computer access also varies by the level of education among parents. Teens who have a parent with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or more are more likely to say they have access to a computer than teens whose parents have a high school diploma or less (94% vs. 78%).</p><p>As smartphone access has become more prevalent, a growing share of teens now report using the Internet on a near-constant basis. Some 45% of teens say they use the Internet &ldquo;almost constantly,&rdquo; a figure that has nearly doubled from the 24% who said this in the 2014-2015 survey. Another 44% say they go online several times a day, meaning roughly nine-in-ten teens go online at least multiple times per day.</p><p>Despite the nearly ubiquitous presence of social media in their lives, there is no clear consensus among teens about these platforms&rsquo; ultimate impact on people their age. A plurality of teens (45%) believe social media has a neither positive nor negative effect on people their age. Meanwhile, roughly three-in-ten teens (31%) say social media has had a mostly positive impact, while 24% describe its effect as mostly negative.</p><p>Given the opportunity to explain their views in their own words, teens who say social media has had a mostly positive effect tended to stress issues related to connectivity and connection with others. Some 40% of these respondents said that social media has had a positive impact because it helps them keep in touch and interact with others. Many of these responses emphasize how social media has made it easier to communicate with family and friends and to connect with new people: &ldquo;I think social media have a positive effect because it lets you talk to family members far away.&rdquo; (Girl, age 14) &ldquo;I feel that social media can make people my age feel less lonely or alone. It creates a space where you can interact with people.&rdquo; (Girl, age 15) &ldquo;It enables people to connect with friends easily and be able to make new friends as well.&rdquo; (Boy, age 15) Others in this group cite the greater access to news and information that social media facilitates (16%), or being able to connect with people who share similar interests (15%): &ldquo;My mom had to get a ride to the library to get what I have in my hand all the time. She reminds me of that a lot.&rdquo; (Girl, age 14) &ldquo;It has given many kids my age an outlet to express their opinions and emotions, and connect with people who feel the same way.&rdquo; (Girl, age 15) Smaller shares argue that social media is a good venue for entertainment (9%), that it offers a space for selfexpression (7%) or that it allows teens to get support from others (5%) or to learn new things in general (4%).</p><p>There is slightly less consensus among teens who say social media has had a mostly negative effect on people their age. The top response (mentioned by 27% of these teens) is that social media has led to more bullying and the overall spread of rumours: &ldquo;Gives people a bigger audience to speak and teach hate and belittle each other.&rdquo; (Boy, age 13) Meanwhile, 17% of these respondents feel these platforms harm relationships and result in less meaningful human interactions. Similar shares think social media distorts reality and gives teens an unrealistic view of other people&rsquo;s lives (15%), or that teens spend too much time on social media (14%): &ldquo;It has a negative impact on social (in-person) interactions.&rdquo; (Boy, age 17) &ldquo;It makes it harder for people to socialize in real life, because they become accustomed to not interacting with people in person.&rdquo; (Girl, age 15) Another 12% criticize social media for influencing teens to give in to peer pressure, while smaller shares express concerns that these sites could lead to psychological issues or drama.</p><p>(adapted from http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018)</p><p>1.

I would like to personally wait for you at the airport and take you on a guided tour. &nbsp;</p><p>For a start, I&rsquo;ll show you the Arch of Triumph, one of Romania&rsquo;s most recognizable landmarks. From there, I will take you to Herastrau Park, and then we&rsquo;ll see where we&rsquo;ll end up.</p><p>I&rsquo;m eagerly awaiting your confirmation. &nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely, Chris</p><p><strong>Subiectul al II-lea</strong></p><p>You have recently participated in a class discussion on the topic of improving the environment. The discussion centred around three main ideas: recycling, public transport and planting trees. You have decided to write an essay on this topic for your teacher describing three ideas to improve the environment and their beneficial effects. You may use the ideas provided or come up with solutions of your own.&nbsp;</p><p>Write your essay in 180 - 200 words.</p><p><strong>Răspuns:</strong></p><p>Given the current situation regarding the climate crisis, I think it is high time for everyone to take action. Of course, this is easier said than done. Not everyone wants to be involved or put in even the slightest effort. &nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, there are still ways we can overcome this crisis without imposing rules over others. Those who want to make a change can start by partaking in climate-friendly activities like recycling, planting trees, and choosing green alternatives to their favorite products.</p><p>However, if you want to leave an even more noticeable impact, you might want to consider the following:</p><p>First and foremost, skip out on traditional fossil-fuel vehicles. Instead, opt for an electric or at least for a hybrid vehicle to greatly reduce greenhouse gases.</p><p>Secondly, consider donating money to an NGO whose mission is to help out the environment. Their volunteers do a lot of work and they need money to feed themselves and invest in equipment that will help them to accomplish their tasks.</p><p>Finally, the next best thing you can do is to switch to nuclear, wind, or solar energy. This is easier said than done but it will leave the biggest impact in the long run.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="oral.html" title="Bacalaureat Engleza 2021 | Modele de subiecte | Oral" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Oral</span></a><a href="audio.html" title="Bacalaureat Engleza 2021 | Modele de subiecte | Audio" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Audio</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

It is the biggest island on the continent, located just off the shore of France, west of the Netherlands, and north of Spain. Great Britain is part of the sovereign state called the United Kingdom, and contains three of its four countries: England, Scotland, and Wales. England, the biggest part of the island, is in the southeast, and its capital city is London, which is also the capital of the United Kingdom. Scotland is to the north of England, and its capital is Edinburgh. Wales is to the west of England, and its capital is Cardiff. Great Britain is not the name of the country itself. Many people call the UK \u0027England\u0027 or \u0022Great Britain\u0022, and British people who do not live in these areas may not like it if other people make this mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWest of Great Britain is a smaller island called Ireland. Ireland contains the Republic of Ireland, which is a country in itself, as well as Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is not a part of the island of Great Britain, but it is part of the United Kingdom. This is why Great Britain is not the same as the United Kingdom, because Northern Ireland, which is one of its four constituent countries, is not part of Great Britain. Together with some other islands, Ireland and Great Britain form the British Isles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe political union that joined the kingdoms of England and Scotland happened in 1707 when the Acts of Union ratified the 1706 Treaty of Union and merged the parliaments of the two nations, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain, which covered the entire island. Before this, a personal union had existed between these two countries since the 1603 Union of the Crowns under James VI of Scotland and I of England. That union was called the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, Ireland joined up with Great Britain, which made one country called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish Free State left the United Kingdom in 1922.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\u0022text-align:right;\u0022\u003e(https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.

For questions 1-10, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome 95% of teens now say they have or have access to a smartphone, which represents a 22- percentage-point increase from the 73% of teens who said this in 2014-2015. Smartphone ownership is nearly universal among teens of different genders, races and ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. A more nuanced story emerges when it comes to teens\u0026rsquo; access to computers. While 88% of teens report having access to a desktop or laptop computer at home, access varies greatly by income level. Fully 96% of teens from households with an annual income of $75,000 or more per year say they have access to a computer at home, but that share falls to 75% among those from households earning less than $30,000 a year. Computer access also varies by the level of education among parents. Teens who have a parent with a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree or more are more likely to say they have access to a computer than teens whose parents have a high school diploma or less (94% vs. 78%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs smartphone access has become more prevalent, a growing share of teens now report using the Internet on a near-constant basis. Some 45% of teens say they use the Internet \u0026ldquo;almost constantly,\u0026rdquo; a figure that has nearly doubled from the 24% who said this in the 2014-2015 survey. Another 44% say they go online several times a day, meaning roughly nine-in-ten teens go online at least multiple times per day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the nearly ubiquitous presence of social media in their lives, there is no clear consensus among teens about these platforms\u0026rsquo; ultimate impact on people their age. A plurality of teens (45%) believe social media has a neither positive nor negative effect on people their age. Meanwhile, roughly three-in-ten teens (31%) say social media has had a mostly positive impact, while 24% describe its effect as mostly negative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven the opportunity to explain their views in their own words, teens who say social media has had a mostly positive effect tended to stress issues related to connectivity and connection with others. Some 40% of these respondents said that social media has had a positive impact because it helps them keep in touch and interact with others. Many of these responses emphasize how social media has made it easier to communicate with family and friends and to connect with new people: \u0026ldquo;I think social media have a positive effect because it lets you talk to family members far away.\u0026rdquo; (Girl, age 14) \u0026ldquo;I feel that social media can make people my age feel less lonely or alone. It creates a space where you can interact with people.\u0026rdquo; (Girl, age 15) \u0026ldquo;It enables people to connect with friends easily and be able to make new friends as well.\u0026rdquo; (Boy, age 15) Others in this group cite the greater access to news and information that social media facilitates (16%), or being able to connect with people who share similar interests (15%): \u0026ldquo;My mom had to get a ride to the library to get what I have in my hand all the time. She reminds me of that a lot.\u0026rdquo; (Girl, age 14) \u0026ldquo;It has given many kids my age an outlet to express their opinions and emotions, and connect with people who feel the same way.\u0026rdquo; (Girl, age 15) Smaller shares argue that social media is a good venue for entertainment (9%), that it offers a space for selfexpression (7%) or that it allows teens to get support from others (5%) or to learn new things in general (4%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is slightly less consensus among teens who say social media has had a mostly negative effect on people their age. The top response (mentioned by 27% of these teens) is that social media has led to more bullying and the overall spread of rumours: \u0026ldquo;Gives people a bigger audience to speak and teach hate and belittle each other.\u0026rdquo; (Boy, age 13) Meanwhile, 17% of these respondents feel these platforms harm relationships and result in less meaningful human interactions. Similar shares think social media distorts reality and gives teens an unrealistic view of other people\u0026rsquo;s lives (15%), or that teens spend too much time on social media (14%): \u0026ldquo;It has a negative impact on social (in-person) interactions.\u0026rdquo; (Boy, age 17) \u0026ldquo;It makes it harder for people to socialize in real life, because they become accustomed to not interacting with people in person.\u0026rdquo; (Girl, age 15) Another 12% criticize social media for influencing teens to give in to peer pressure, while smaller shares express concerns that these sites could lead to psychological issues or drama.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(adapted from http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.
