He is thirty years old (Part 1, 6%). Guy has black hair, soot-colored eyebrows, and bluish-looking skin where his beard is shaved off (Part 1. 45%). His face is marked by the many fires he has witnessed, he has furrows around his mouth (part 1, 6%). He wears the number "451" (Part 1, 8%) on his fireman uniform. <strong>He wears a permanent smile on his face</strong> and cannot remember ever not having smiled (Part 1, 2%).</p><p>Guy Montag has been a fireman since he turned twenty, (Part 1, 6%). His job is to burn books and houses where books are hidden, because owning books is considered a serious crime. <strong>Guy loves his job</strong> at the beginning of the novel (Part 1, 1%%).</p><p>Guy is married to Mildred. Because she did not want children, Guy never became a father (Part 1, 26%). The two spouses are characterized by a great<strong> mutual emotional distance</strong>. They sleep in separate beds (Part 1, 14%), separated by a glass wall (Part 1, 94%).</p><p>Mildred is constantly listening to the radio or watching TV and lives almost exclusively in this artificial world. She considers the characters on TV as her family instead of Guy (Part 1, 69%). Guy does not know what affects Mildred, but he knows that she is not well, because she attempts suicide (Part 1, 15%), which she later denies (Part 1, 25% ). She, in turn, does not want to know anything about Guy&rsquo;s thoughts and problems, especially when Guy begins to doubt his view of the world (Part 1, 71% ff.).</p><h2 id="heading-n7f09" data-guid="1b99d7f4-c9e2-4094-b2bc-3d8509404e9e">Clarisse and Mildred</h2><p>When Guy meets the seventeen-year-old Clarisse by chance, <strong>his world is torn apart</strong>. He is fascinated by the beautiful teenager from the first moment, especially because she behaves completely differently from the "normal" people in Guy's everyday life. She goes for walks at night, thinks a lot, and loves nature (Part 1, 5%-7% ). The daughter of the new neighbors asks Guy many questions, which cause him to have doubts. At first, he laughs at the questions, for example when Clarisse asks him if he sometimes reads books (Part 1, 6%) - after all, that is forbidden. But when she asks him if he is happy, he stops laughing (Part 1, 7%). Guy has to admit to himself that he is indeed <strong>unhappy</strong> (Part 1, 9%). He wore his happiness "like a mask" with which Clarisse "had run off" (Part 1, 9%).&nbsp;</p><p>Guy <strong>behaves differently from other firemen</strong>: he listens to Clarisse and does nothing to her (Part 1, 31%). Guy is not violent like other people; he does not want to kill animals, as Mildred likes to do on her joyrides, or run people over, as most teenagers do. He doesn't want to hurt anyone. For him, at the beginning, burning houses does not mean a conflict with his job, as long as he only destroys things (part 1, 51%). Guy realizes only later that these things, especially the books, have an emotional value for some people.</p><p>Guy learns that his wife Mildred has tried to take her own life. This incident makes him very thoughtful. While paramedics pump Mildred's stomach , Guy realizes he lives in a very crude society Part 1, 18%). A war is about to break out, and no one is talking seriously about it. Since Guy witnessed Mildred's suicide attempt, <strong>his permanent smile has disappeared from his face</strong> (Part 2, 18%). He has been numb ever since.</p><h2 id="heading-b5ljh" data-guid="727b9fdd-e2b3-46a6-b218-e9efc2315195">Questioning the world</h2><p>At the fire station, Guy <strong>slowly becomes an outsider</strong>. While his colleagues like to play with the mechanical tracking dog and make bets on which animals the dog will kill first, Guy stays away from it (Part 1, 32%). The dog has been reacting aggressively to Guy for a while. In addition, Guy asks some uncomfortable questions, such as whether the fire department has always started fires (Part 1, 46%). This makes him sound suspicious.</p><p>Guy criticizes his boss, Captain Beatty, for the way people who hide books are dealt with and because even people who are not troubled at all are put away (Part 1, 46%). Guy, unlike his colleagues, has recently been tempted to imagine what it must be like to have his own possessions burned (Part 1, 46%).</p><p>When a woman is killed during an assignment because she refuses to surrender her house with the books to the flames, <strong>this clearly goes too far for Guy</strong>. The woman finally sets herself and her books on fire. The firemen do nothing to save the woman, although Guy tries to get his boss to intervene (Part 1, 54%).</p><p>After all these events, <strong>Guy's eyes are suddenly opened</strong> to things he has long repressed. He realizes that he is not in love with his wife (Part 1, 62%). He realizes that he did not choose his job for himself, but "in (his) sleep ran after" his father and grandfather, who were also firemen (Part 1, 74%). He suddenly realizes that the TV program Mildred is watching all the time is completely pointless and that the dialogues consist only of hollow, incoherent small talk (Part 1, 62%).&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-350xg" data-guid="1f4c317a-0b83-4439-90cc-96c75a93d146">The secret booklover</h2><p>One day Guy met Faber in the park, and although the old literature professor showed him the books he was carrying around and even gave him his address afterwards (Part 2, 10%), Guy never betrayed the old man - as if he already secretly knew that this encounter might turn into something important one day.</p><p>Guy makes contact with Faber again (cf. Part 2, 10%). He brings him a Bible that he saved from the flames (Part 2, 26%). Faber quickly realizes that <strong>Guy has begun to think for himself</strong> (Part 2, 36%). The two men conspire to fight the system and duplicate books (Part 2, 46%).</p><p>Guy asks Faber for help when he has to face Beatty again (Part 2, 49%). Faber hands Guy a radio capsule for his ear, which works like a radio (Part 2, 49%f.). This allows Faber to help Guy with tips by transmitting them directly into Guy's ear.</p><p>Guy realizes that <strong>he has always just carried out orders</strong> and followed instructions without critically questioning them. He was Guy "who knew nothing, who did not even know himself a fool, but only suspected it" (Part 2, 82%). Now that he has become aware of this problem, he even has doubts about whether he should follow Faber's instructions. He is concerned that he might be used by Faber in the same way he is by Beatty (Part 2, 54%).</p><p>He is tormented by the thought that Faber is taking over a part of him because he now constantly hears his voice in his ear. But it is precisely these concerns and doubts that make it clear that Guy has already begun to think for himself. <strong>He finally wants to find his own way</strong>. He is annoyed by his own insecurity and he longs for the "very quiet" (Part 2, 100%).</p><h2 id="heading-df0b9" data-guid="0b1d7cc7-3bc0-4691-9c26-868e28cd013f">The rebel</h2><p>Guy <strong>becomes quite rebellious</strong> in a very short time. He takes a sick day and seriously considers quitting his job altogether (Part 1, 72%). He tries to convince Mildred that something has to change because she is suicidal, and he has a terrible job. He wants, as he says, to get out of the "mess" (Part 1, 97%) together with Mildred, he wants to prevent the worst. He feels that he is heading for a "precipice" and has no intention of "plunging down."&nbsp;</p><p>He shows his wife the hoarded books and begins to read them, although she is strictly against it (Part 1, 98%). He reads an emotionally upsetting war poem to Mildred and her friends (Part 2, 74%), and when Mrs. Bowles is outraged because the poem made Mrs. Phelps cry, he angrily throws her out (Part 2, 77%). Later, his guilty conscience plagues him for making Mrs. Phelps cry (Part 2, 85%). Mildred then secretly betrays her husband to Beatty because of book ownership.</p><h2 id="heading-ezdjz" data-guid="300dc6c0-6d2a-4b44-9a5c-71cae03fb65e">Murder, escape, and a new beginning</h2><p>On their next watch, the firemen drive to Guy's house: Beatty forces Guy to burn down his own house, where the books are hidden (Part 3, 4%ff.). , Guy kills Beatty to protect Faber. Shortly after the murder, Guy sarcastically says (to the dead Beatty), "You always said, don't face a problem, burn it" (part 3, 16%). However, after a while Guy feels remorse and inwardly begs for forgiveness (Part 3, 18%).</p><p>Now Guy is being pursued by the police as a murderer and deserter. He first finds shelter with Faber, who helps him to escape. Faber tells him about a group of intellectual dissidents outside the city that Guy could join. The two men agree to reconnect in St. Louis, the city where Faber wants to flee to (Part 3, 37%).</p><p>Guy flees the city because people are looking for him(Part 3, 45%ff.). He meets the group of intellectual dissidents south of the city, and they welcome him (Part 3, 65%). Guy becomes part of the pacifist group led by Granger, whose mission is to bring literature back to the people orally once the war is over (Part 3, 75%).&nbsp;Guy has begun to memorize his books.</p><h2 id="heading-5wo3i" data-guid="16dd2fcc-5386-4266-9104-e81a99de003f">Conclusion</h2><p>Guy Montag was an exemplary fireman who enjoyed his work. His meeting with his extraordinary neighbor was the beginning of his development into a rebel. He suddenly realizes that his life does not make him happy and that he contributes to the maintenance of a flawed system.</p><p>With the help of Clarisse, Faber, and Granger and the group of dissidents, Guy manages to break out of the patterns of the past, to take his life into his own hands and reshape it.

He is thirty years old (Part 1, 6%). Guy has black hair, soot-colored eyebrows, and bluish-looking skin where his beard is shaved off (Part 1. 45%). His face is marked by the many fires he has witnessed, he has furrows around his mouth (part 1, 6%). He wears the number \u0022451\u0022 (Part 1, 8%) on his fireman uniform. \u003cstrong\u003eHe wears a permanent smile on his face\u003c/strong\u003e and cannot remember ever not having smiled (Part 1, 2%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy Montag has been a fireman since he turned twenty, (Part 1, 6%). His job is to burn books and houses where books are hidden, because owning books is considered a serious crime. \u003cstrong\u003eGuy loves his job\u003c/strong\u003e at the beginning of the novel (Part 1, 1%%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy is married to Mildred. Because she did not want children, Guy never became a father (Part 1, 26%). The two spouses are characterized by a great\u003cstrong\u003e mutual emotional distance\u003c/strong\u003e. They sleep in separate beds (Part 1, 14%), separated by a glass wall (Part 1, 94%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMildred is constantly listening to the radio or watching TV and lives almost exclusively in this artificial world. She considers the characters on TV as her family instead of Guy (Part 1, 69%). Guy does not know what affects Mildred, but he knows that she is not well, because she attempts suicide (Part 1, 15%), which she later denies (Part 1, 25% ). She, in turn, does not want to know anything about Guy\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and problems, especially when Guy begins to doubt his view of the world (Part 1, 71% ff.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-n7f09\u0022 data-guid=\u00221b99d7f4-c9e2-4094-b2bc-3d8509404e9e\u0022\u003eClarisse and Mildred\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Guy meets the seventeen-year-old Clarisse by chance, \u003cstrong\u003ehis world is torn apart\u003c/strong\u003e. He is fascinated by the beautiful teenager from the first moment, especially because she behaves completely differently from the \u0022normal\u0022 people in Guy\u0027s everyday life. She goes for walks at night, thinks a lot, and loves nature (Part 1, 5%-7% ). The daughter of the new neighbors asks Guy many questions, which cause him to have doubts. At first, he laughs at the questions, for example when Clarisse asks him if he sometimes reads books (Part 1, 6%) - after all, that is forbidden. But when she asks him if he is happy, he stops laughing (Part 1, 7%). Guy has to admit to himself that he is indeed \u003cstrong\u003eunhappy\u003c/strong\u003e (Part 1, 9%). He wore his happiness \u0022like a mask\u0022 with which Clarisse \u0022had run off\u0022 (Part 1, 9%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy \u003cstrong\u003ebehaves differently from other firemen\u003c/strong\u003e: he listens to Clarisse and does nothing to her (Part 1, 31%). Guy is not violent like other people; he does not want to kill animals, as Mildred likes to do on her joyrides, or run people over, as most teenagers do. He doesn\u0027t want to hurt anyone. For him, at the beginning, burning houses does not mean a conflict with his job, as long as he only destroys things (part 1, 51%). Guy realizes only later that these things, especially the books, have an emotional value for some people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy learns that his wife Mildred has tried to take her own life. This incident makes him very thoughtful. While paramedics pump Mildred\u0027s stomach , Guy realizes he lives in a very crude society Part 1, 18%). A war is about to break out, and no one is talking seriously about it. Since Guy witnessed Mildred\u0027s suicide attempt, \u003cstrong\u003ehis permanent smile has disappeared from his face\u003c/strong\u003e (Part 2, 18%). He has been numb ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-b5ljh\u0022 data-guid=\u0022727b9fdd-e2b3-46a6-b218-e9efc2315195\u0022\u003eQuestioning the world\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the fire station, Guy \u003cstrong\u003eslowly becomes an outsider\u003c/strong\u003e. While his colleagues like to play with the mechanical tracking dog and make bets on which animals the dog will kill first, Guy stays away from it (Part 1, 32%). The dog has been reacting aggressively to Guy for a while. In addition, Guy asks some uncomfortable questions, such as whether the fire department has always started fires (Part 1, 46%). This makes him sound suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy criticizes his boss, Captain Beatty, for the way people who hide books are dealt with and because even people who are not troubled at all are put away (Part 1, 46%). Guy, unlike his colleagues, has recently been tempted to imagine what it must be like to have his own possessions burned (Part 1, 46%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a woman is killed during an assignment because she refuses to surrender her house with the books to the flames, \u003cstrong\u003ethis clearly goes too far for Guy\u003c/strong\u003e. The woman finally sets herself and her books on fire. The firemen do nothing to save the woman, although Guy tries to get his boss to intervene (Part 1, 54%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all these events, \u003cstrong\u003eGuy\u0027s eyes are suddenly opened\u003c/strong\u003e to things he has long repressed. He realizes that he is not in love with his wife (Part 1, 62%). He realizes that he did not choose his job for himself, but \u0022in (his) sleep ran after\u0022 his father and grandfather, who were also firemen (Part 1, 74%). He suddenly realizes that the TV program Mildred is watching all the time is completely pointless and that the dialogues consist only of hollow, incoherent small talk (Part 1, 62%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-350xg\u0022 data-guid=\u00221f4c317a-0b83-4439-90cc-96c75a93d146\u0022\u003eThe secret booklover\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne day Guy met Faber in the park, and although the old literature professor showed him the books he was carrying around and even gave him his address afterwards (Part 2, 10%), Guy never betrayed the old man - as if he already secretly knew that this encounter might turn into something important one day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy makes contact with Faber again (cf. Part 2, 10%). He brings him a Bible that he saved from the flames (Part 2, 26%). Faber quickly realizes that \u003cstrong\u003eGuy has begun to think for himself\u003c/strong\u003e (Part 2, 36%). The two men conspire to fight the system and duplicate books (Part 2, 46%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy asks Faber for help when he has to face Beatty again (Part 2, 49%). Faber hands Guy a radio capsule for his ear, which works like a radio (Part 2, 49%f.). This allows Faber to help Guy with tips by transmitting them directly into Guy\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy realizes that \u003cstrong\u003ehe has always just carried out orders\u003c/strong\u003e and followed instructions without critically questioning them. He was Guy \u0022who knew nothing, who did not even know himself a fool, but only suspected it\u0022 (Part 2, 82%). Now that he has become aware of this problem, he even has doubts about whether he should follow Faber\u0027s instructions. He is concerned that he might be used by Faber in the same way he is by Beatty (Part 2, 54%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe is tormented by the thought that Faber is taking over a part of him because he now constantly hears his voice in his ear. But it is precisely these concerns and doubts that make it clear that Guy has already begun to think for himself. \u003cstrong\u003eHe finally wants to find his own way\u003c/strong\u003e. He is annoyed by his own insecurity and he longs for the \u0022very quiet\u0022 (Part 2, 100%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-df0b9\u0022 data-guid=\u00220b1d7cc7-3bc0-4691-9c26-868e28cd013f\u0022\u003eThe rebel\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy \u003cstrong\u003ebecomes quite rebellious\u003c/strong\u003e in a very short time. He takes a sick day and seriously considers quitting his job altogether (Part 1, 72%). He tries to convince Mildred that something has to change because she is suicidal, and he has a terrible job. He wants, as he says, to get out of the \u0022mess\u0022 (Part 1, 97%) together with Mildred, he wants to prevent the worst. He feels that he is heading for a \u0022precipice\u0022 and has no intention of \u0022plunging down.\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe shows his wife the hoarded books and begins to read them, although she is strictly against it (Part 1, 98%). He reads an emotionally upsetting war poem to Mildred and her friends (Part 2, 74%), and when Mrs. Bowles is outraged because the poem made Mrs. Phelps cry, he angrily throws her out (Part 2, 77%). Later, his guilty conscience plagues him for making Mrs. Phelps cry (Part 2, 85%). Mildred then secretly betrays her husband to Beatty because of book ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ezdjz\u0022 data-guid=\u0022300dc6c0-6d2a-4b44-9a5c-71cae03fb65e\u0022\u003eMurder, escape, and a new beginning\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn their next watch, the firemen drive to Guy\u0027s house: Beatty forces Guy to burn down his own house, where the books are hidden (Part 3, 4%ff.). , Guy kills Beatty to protect Faber. Shortly after the murder, Guy sarcastically says (to the dead Beatty), \u0022You always said, don\u0027t face a problem, burn it\u0022 (part 3, 16%). However, after a while Guy feels remorse and inwardly begs for forgiveness (Part 3, 18%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow Guy is being pursued by the police as a murderer and deserter. He first finds shelter with Faber, who helps him to escape. Faber tells him about a group of intellectual dissidents outside the city that Guy could join. The two men agree to reconnect in St. Louis, the city where Faber wants to flee to (Part 3, 37%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy flees the city because people are looking for him(Part 3, 45%ff.). He meets the group of intellectual dissidents south of the city, and they welcome him (Part 3, 65%). Guy becomes part of the pacifist group led by Granger, whose mission is to bring literature back to the people orally once the war is over (Part 3, 75%).\u0026nbsp;Guy has begun to memorize his books.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5wo3i\u0022 data-guid=\u002216dd2fcc-5386-4266-9104-e81a99de003f\u0022\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy Montag was an exemplary fireman who enjoyed his work. His meeting with his extraordinary neighbor was the beginning of his development into a rebel. He suddenly realizes that his life does not make him happy and that he contributes to the maintenance of a flawed system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the help of Clarisse, Faber, and Granger and the group of dissidents, Guy manages to break out of the patterns of the past, to take his life into his own hands and reshape it. He leaves behind his wife Mildred and his job at the fire department.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy explains his transformation to himself as follows: \u0022 \u0026lsquo;It saved itself up to happen. I could feel it for a long time, I was saving something up, I went around doing one thing and feeling another.
