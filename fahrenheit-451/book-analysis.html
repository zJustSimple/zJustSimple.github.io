In the U.S., Fahrenheit is the official unit of temperature measurement, unlike in other countries where Celsius is the unit of measurement. 451 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to a temperature of approximately 232 degrees Celsius. This is the ignition temperature of paper, which means that at a heat of 232 degrees Celsius, paper begins to burn.</p><p>In the society described in the novel, a million books have been banned because they are considered the cause of all human unhappiness. People who own banned books are often denounced and then punished. Their houses are burned along with the books. So the title refers to the book burnings in history.</p><p>Another word for &ldquo;fireman&rdquo;is &ldquo;firefighter&rdquo;, which is now used more often. The word "firefighter" clearly indicates someone who fights fire (to fight). But Ray Bradbury did not call the job "firefighter", but "fireman" - because this can be both a fireman and a man who sets fires.</p><h2 data-guid="e3689588-3edf-453e-b3f8-5eaaf46cf2a9" id="heading-lmn44">Characters</h2><p>In the book Fahrenheit 451, the main character is <a href="characters/guy-montag.html">Guy Montag</a>. He is a fireman, and in the future society that the book takes place in, that means that his job is to burn all books that are found, because books are illegal. Guy Montag is a kind man, but at the same time, when the book begins, he does not really think a lot. Like most of the other people in this society, he just follows the flow and never questions why books are illegal. However, through the course of the story, this changes dramatically, and he begins to act against the government.</p><p>Montag&rsquo;s wife, <a href="characters/mildred-montag.html">Mildred</a>, is also an important character. I think she might be one of my least favorite characters, because I find the way she gossips with her friends about things of no importance while she at the same time knows the changes her husband is going through, very disturbing. She has absolutely no compassion, and when Montag tries talking to her about what he is thinking about, she does not even make an attempt at listening to him. She only cares about herself, and her &ldquo;family&rdquo;, which is a TV-program she watches on her floor-to-ceiling, three wall television.</p><p>A character who does not play a very big role, but who is nevertheless very important, is<a href="characters/clarisse-mcclellan.html"> Clarisse McClellan</a>. She is Montag&rsquo;s new neighbor, and Montag meets her at the very beginning of the book. She asks a lot of questions about his job, and these questions make him think. So although we just see Clarisse for a short period in the first part of the book, she stays with us in our minds throughout the entire story. And it is her influence on Montag that makes him rethink his opinions about the government, and at last rebel against it.</p><p>Bradbury briefly mentions some of Montag&rsquo;s colleagues, but none of these play any large roles. However, Montag&rsquo;s boss, <a href="characters/captain-beatty.html">Captain Beatty</a>, is an important character. Beatty is a wise man, and although it does not say so in the book, I wonder if he might have read a couple of books during his time as a fireman. He is a very persuasive person, and he seems very powerful, and he is one of the challenges Montag faces as he is trying to change their society. When Beatty discovers that Montag himself is hiding books in his house, he goes to burn Montag&rsquo;s house, and this ends up with Montag killing Beatty.</p><p>The last characters I want to mention are the people who supported Montag, and who were on his side on the fight to preserve the books. The first person Montag meets is <a href="characters/faber.html">Faber</a>, and old and gentle man, who although he has a lot of books, prefers to be careful and does not want to make a big fuss about things. He does not dare to join Montag when he is going to plant some of the books in other firemen&rsquo;s houses (to make it look like all firemen are breaking the law), but is at the same time supportive. At the very end of the book, after escaping the firemen and killing his boss, Montag meets a bunch of men living along the railroad. Many of them are old professors, some are authors and some are priests, but they all have in common that they want to preserve the books. So they memorize the books, and every person has one book that they know by heart. This way, although all books are burnt, the books will still live on through these men.</p><h2 id="heading-6dsh8" data-guid="995853c0-b5e1-46b6-a789-61604e9ca455">Setting</h2><p>The setting of the story is very significant in this book. It is an important point that this is happening in the future, and although it is happening in places that exist today (USA), this society has developed out of ours. I think the story could have taken place in another western society, like England or Germany or Canada, that is not an important part of the book, but it needs to be in the future.</p><p>The main problem is the fact that Montag suddenly realizes that the entire society is wrong. Not only does he notice that it is wrong that the government has banned books, but also the entire way people act. Everyone seeks simple entertainment, and they want to have as much personal control as possible. All people do all day is watch their floor-to-ceiling televisions, and if they are not doing this they are sleeping with their little &ldquo;bees&rdquo;, which are little ear buds that close the world outside by making a soothing humming sound, or they are speeding around in their cars. Nobody needs to challenge themselves, and the only things people value are personal pleasure, control and comfort. But as Montag realizes, these three points do not add up to happiness. This is a quote from right after Montag met Clarisse for the first time, and she asked him &ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask, and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way going to knock on her door to ask for it back.&rdquo;</p><p>So this is the main conflict, Montag realizes that the society gives people false happiness, and that everything is wrong, and he is desperate to do what he can to change it.</p><h2 id="heading-pzkkq" data-guid="c595bfa4-b237-454b-b9d3-2f50a97e3296">Language</h2><p>I felt a lot of emotions while I read this book, because there were a lot of themes that were talked about that I identified with, and I feel like I can identify a lot with Montag. Bradbury uses many comparisons while describing Montag&rsquo;s feelings, and many of these felt very familiar to me. I myself have lately become aware of the situation animals face in our society, and how we view them, and have decided to become vegan, and although this is not the same thing as Montag goes through, I saw a lot of similarities while reading the book. I recognized Montag&rsquo;s feelings of despair and hopelessness, how stressful it was for him to live in a society where just about everyone had not thought about the things he had just discovered, and how relieved he felt when he finally met likeminded people with whom he could talk to and share experiences with. When I recognized all of these feelings, it made me like the book even more, and I think in one way a lot of people may feel the same way about this book, because I think many people feel very different than the majority of society, and recognize the process Montag goes through when he realizes that he is not happy with the state of things.</p><h2 id="heading-f3kmx" data-guid="f2e444e7-162d-493b-904d-5037429b39ed">Themes</h2><p>Many of the themes the book talks about I have already been thinking a lot about, however, I did get to see things from a different perspective. The book has also really made me think about how we people today are really being swallowed up by the entertainment companies, and how close we are to becoming this society that we see in Fahrenheit 451. I also find it incredibly fascinating how Ray Bradbury wrote this book in 1954, before a lot of the technology he describes in the book had even been invented. We also see how the line between entertainment and information/news is starting to fade, and this is something we saw in the book too. As Montag was being chased after killing Captain Beatty, the news companies were filming the chase, and when Montag got away in the end, the news made up a story about how Montag was caught, so that they would not lose people&rsquo;s attention. To make their fake story seem more realistic, they caught and killed an innocent man who was walking along the street, and claimed that he was Montag, and that the chase was over. There are a couple of very similar stories form our world today, where news companies and the police have gone together in trying to catch someone, and at the same time make an exciting news report, and how this has ended up in more or less innocent people losing their lives.</p><p>At first glance it seems that the theme of Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship and <a href="themes/banned-books.html">banning books</a>, and the negative consequences that this leads to. But Ray Bradbury himself said that this was not the theme he had intended for the book to have when he wrote it. He says the theme was supposed to be about how our lives are more and more about being entertained, and how people are thinking less for themselves. However, after Fahrenheit 451 itself had been <a href="themes/democracy-and-dictatorship.html">censored</a> because of some bad language, Bradbury wrote an introduction for the book where he stressed the importance of not censoring or banning books. I personally think there are a lot of themes in the book, in a lot of ways it is about how our society would be if we banned books, in other ways we see how it is about what our society is developing into in terms of technology and entertainment, and in other ways I think it is about free thinking. In the beginning of the book there is a quote by Juan Ramon Jimenez: &ldquo;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.&rdquo; This quote makes me think of a similar quote by Mark Twain, which I cannot remember exactly, but it goes something like: whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, stop and think. And I think that is the deepest theme of the book, think independently, question the majority and even question yourself.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="summary.html" title="Fahrenheit 451 Summary" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a><a href="characters.html" title="Fahrenheit 451 | Characters" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Characters</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

In the U.S., Fahrenheit is the official unit of temperature measurement, unlike in other countries where Celsius is the unit of measurement. 451 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to a temperature of approximately 232 degrees Celsius. This is the ignition temperature of paper, which means that at a heat of 232 degrees Celsius, paper begins to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the society described in the novel, a million books have been banned because they are considered the cause of all human unhappiness. People who own banned books are often denounced and then punished. Their houses are burned along with the books. So the title refers to the book burnings in history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother word for \u0026ldquo;fireman\u0026rdquo;is \u0026ldquo;firefighter\u0026rdquo;, which is now used more often. The word \u0022firefighter\u0022 clearly indicates someone who fights fire (to fight). But Ray Bradbury did not call the job \u0022firefighter\u0022, but \u0022fireman\u0022 - because this can be both a fireman and a man who sets fires.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022e3689588-3edf-453e-b3f8-5eaaf46cf2a9\u0022 id=\u0022heading-lmn44\u0022\u003eCharacters\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the book Fahrenheit 451, the main character is \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/characters/guy-montag\u0022\u003eGuy Montag\u003c/a\u003e. He is a fireman, and in the future society that the book takes place in, that means that his job is to burn all books that are found, because books are illegal. Guy Montag is a kind man, but at the same time, when the book begins, he does not really think a lot. Like most of the other people in this society, he just follows the flow and never questions why books are illegal. However, through the course of the story, this changes dramatically, and he begins to act against the government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMontag\u0026rsquo;s wife, \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/characters/mildred-montag\u0022\u003eMildred\u003c/a\u003e, is also an important character. I think she might be one of my least favorite characters, because I find the way she gossips with her friends about things of no importance while she at the same time knows the changes her husband is going through, very disturbing. She has absolutely no compassion, and when Montag tries talking to her about what he is thinking about, she does not even make an attempt at listening to him. She only cares about herself, and her \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo;, which is a TV-program she watches on her floor-to-ceiling, three wall television.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA character who does not play a very big role, but who is nevertheless very important, is\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/characters/clarisse-mcclellan\u0022\u003e Clarisse McClellan\u003c/a\u003e. She is Montag\u0026rsquo;s new neighbor, and Montag meets her at the very beginning of the book. She asks a lot of questions about his job, and these questions make him think. So although we just see Clarisse for a short period in the first part of the book, she stays with us in our minds throughout the entire story. And it is her influence on Montag that makes him rethink his opinions about the government, and at last rebel against it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradbury briefly mentions some of Montag\u0026rsquo;s colleagues, but none of these play any large roles. However, Montag\u0026rsquo;s boss, \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/characters/captain-beatty\u0022\u003eCaptain Beatty\u003c/a\u003e, is an important character. Beatty is a wise man, and although it does not say so in the book, I wonder if he might have read a couple of books during his time as a fireman. He is a very persuasive person, and he seems very powerful, and he is one of the challenges Montag faces as he is trying to change their society. When Beatty discovers that Montag himself is hiding books in his house, he goes to burn Montag\u0026rsquo;s house, and this ends up with Montag killing Beatty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last characters I want to mention are the people who supported Montag, and who were on his side on the fight to preserve the books. The first person Montag meets is \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/characters/faber\u0022\u003eFaber\u003c/a\u003e, and old and gentle man, who although he has a lot of books, prefers to be careful and does not want to make a big fuss about things. He does not dare to join Montag when he is going to plant some of the books in other firemen\u0026rsquo;s houses (to make it look like all firemen are breaking the law), but is at the same time supportive. At the very end of the book, after escaping the firemen and killing his boss, Montag meets a bunch of men living along the railroad. Many of them are old professors, some are authors and some are priests, but they all have in common that they want to preserve the books. So they memorize the books, and every person has one book that they know by heart. This way, although all books are burnt, the books will still live on through these men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6dsh8\u0022 data-guid=\u0022995853c0-b5e1-46b6-a789-61604e9ca455\u0022\u003eSetting\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe setting of the story is very significant in this book. It is an important point that this is happening in the future, and although it is happening in places that exist today (USA), this society has developed out of ours. I think the story could have taken place in another western society, like England or Germany or Canada, that is not an important part of the book, but it needs to be in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main problem is the fact that Montag suddenly realizes that the entire society is wrong. Not only does he notice that it is wrong that the government has banned books, but also the entire way people act. Everyone seeks simple entertainment, and they want to have as much personal control as possible. All people do all day is watch their floor-to-ceiling televisions, and if they are not doing this they are sleeping with their little \u0026ldquo;bees\u0026rdquo;, which are little ear buds that close the world outside by making a soothing humming sound, or they are speeding around in their cars. Nobody needs to challenge themselves, and the only things people value are personal pleasure, control and comfort. But as Montag realizes, these three points do not add up to happiness. This is a quote from right after Montag met Clarisse for the first time, and she asked him \u0026ldquo;Are you happy?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask, and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way going to knock on her door to ask for it back.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this is the main conflict, Montag realizes that the society gives people false happiness, and that everything is wrong, and he is desperate to do what he can to change it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-pzkkq\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c595bfa4-b237-454b-b9d3-2f50a97e3296\u0022\u003eLanguage\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI felt a lot of emotions while I read this book, because there were a lot of themes that were talked about that I identified with, and I feel like I can identify a lot with Montag. Bradbury uses many comparisons while describing Montag\u0026rsquo;s feelings, and many of these felt very familiar to me. I myself have lately become aware of the situation animals face in our society, and how we view them, and have decided to become vegan, and although this is not the same thing as Montag goes through, I saw a lot of similarities while reading the book. I recognized Montag\u0026rsquo;s feelings of despair and hopelessness, how stressful it was for him to live in a society where just about everyone had not thought about the things he had just discovered, and how relieved he felt when he finally met likeminded people with whom he could talk to and share experiences with. When I recognized all of these feelings, it made me like the book even more, and I think in one way a lot of people may feel the same way about this book, because I think many people feel very different than the majority of society, and recognize the process Montag goes through when he realizes that he is not happy with the state of things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-f3kmx\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f2e444e7-162d-493b-904d-5037429b39ed\u0022\u003eThemes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of the themes the book talks about I have already been thinking a lot about, however, I did get to see things from a different perspective. The book has also really made me think about how we people today are really being swallowed up by the entertainment companies, and how close we are to becoming this society that we see in Fahrenheit 451. I also find it incredibly fascinating how Ray Bradbury wrote this book in 1954, before a lot of the technology he describes in the book had even been invented. We also see how the line between entertainment and information/news is starting to fade, and this is something we saw in the book too. As Montag was being chased after killing Captain Beatty, the news companies were filming the chase, and when Montag got away in the end, the news made up a story about how Montag was caught, so that they would not lose people\u0026rsquo;s attention. To make their fake story seem more realistic, they caught and killed an innocent man who was walking along the street, and claimed that he was Montag, and that the chase was over. There are a couple of very similar stories form our world today, where news companies and the police have gone together in trying to catch someone, and at the same time make an exciting news report, and how this has ended up in more or less innocent people losing their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first glance it seems that the theme of Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship and \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/themes/banned-books\u0022\u003ebanning books\u003c/a\u003e, and the negative consequences that this leads to. But Ray Bradbury himself said that this was not the theme he had intended for the book to have when he wrote it. He says the theme was supposed to be about how our lives are more and more about being entertained, and how people are thinking less for themselves. However, after Fahrenheit 451 itself had been \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/themes/democracy-and-dictatorship\u0022\u003ecensored\u003c/a\u003e because of some bad language, Bradbury wrote an introduction for the book where he stressed the importance of not censoring or banning books. I personally think there are a lot of themes in the book, in a lot of ways it is about how our society would be if we banned books, in other ways we see how it is about what our society is developing into in terms of technology and entertainment, and in other ways I think it is about free thinking. In the beginning of the book there is a quote by Juan Ramon Jimenez: \u0026ldquo;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.\u0026rdquo; This quote makes me think of a similar quote by Mark Twain, which I cannot remember exactly, but it goes something like: whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, stop and think. And I think that is the deepest theme of the book, think independently, question the majority and even question yourself.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Fahrenheit 451 | Book analysis","MetaDescription":"The title of Ray Bradbury’s novel Fahrenheit 451 refers to a temperature specification in the temperature unit Fahrenheit, named after Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.
