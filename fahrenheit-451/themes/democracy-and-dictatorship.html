Mildred and her friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, are talking about the last election. Mrs. Bowles tells them that she voted for President Noble, "same as everyone," because he was "one of the nicest-looking men who ever became president." (Part 2, 67%).&nbsp;</p><p>The women then gossip about the opposing candidate, who was " small and homely" unshaven and with a bad haircut (Part 2, 67%). They are clear that "the Outs(...) don't go running a little short man like that against a tall man" (Part 2, 67%f.).&nbsp;He was, moreover, &ldquo;fat&rdquo; and had an unclear pronunciation, and therefore one would hardly have heard what he said, "and the words I did hear I didn't understand!" (Part 2, 69%).</p><p>Like all other citizens, the women chose the most handsome presidential candidate. For example, the women were particularly struck by the fact that the opposing candidate, Hoag, was constantly picking his nose while he was on the screens in the TV room (Part 2, 69%).</p><p>It should be noted at this point that the women are not particularly interested in the ideas of the two candidates in the discussion. The possible differences between their political intentions are not discussed by the women. The citizens in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> prefer not to ask questions and avoid conflict in order to remain permanently happy.</p><p>Furthermore, the name and image of the two presidential candidates contrast completely. President "Winston Noble" (whose surname is supposed to suggest how distinguished he is) ran against "Hubert Hoag" (a hoagie is the American term for a giant sandwich). Noble is tall and handsome, while Hoag is short and fat, so he could not win the election.</p><p>The two-party system in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> turns out to be a <strong>false democracy</strong>. Two parodied candidates run and are elected on the basis of their appearance rather than their program. <strong>The election result seems to be fixed in advance</strong>. Free elections thus do not seem to guarantee that a state is a real democracy. <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>related to a dictatorship, a system of government that requires complete obedience to the state</p>">Totalitarian </span>systems all over the world also arrange fictitious elections to create a democratic alibi for themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-ardud" data-guid="5bbfd704-983b-461b-9b96-b027991701a5">Will of the people, prohibition, censorship and murder</h2><p>According to Beatty, the book ban in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> was not originally imposed by the state: " It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God." (Part 1, 83%). Faber later confirms Beatty's statement when he declares, "Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord." (PART 2, 95%). Mass culture and entertainment have evolved into a dictatorship of dumbing down, which Beatty explains in a lengthy speech (Part 1, 70-87%).</p><p>The state has now legalized the general popular practice of ignoring books and has tightened it with the help of <strong>censorship and prohibition</strong>. For the state, this was a good opportunity to <strong>destroy the sources of information</strong> to the dissenters and further eliminate the criminal dissidents who own books. The books are now demonized: they are characterized as edged guns (Part 1, 85%), thus it is justified to destroy them.</p><p>The laws are put into practice by force, at least with regard to the ban on the possession of books. In the past, the police took the residents who hid books out of their houses and taped their mouths shut in the process. Now firemen sometimes have to manage the people on their own. It is accepted that people who do not want to leave their books to the flames die. In "<i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, the fire department is both judicial and executive . It can also murder people without trial with the help of the Mechanical Hound (see analysis <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>https://primestudyguides.com/fahrenheit-451/analysis/symbols#heading-3x4em</p>">"The Mechanical Hound"</span>).</p><p>For example, to cover up the failure of the system and to portray the infallibility of the state, the police and firemen do not hesitate to pass off an innocent man as Guy Montag and execute him after the real Guy Montag escapes from the police.</p><h2 id="heading-5awgc" data-guid="3f0832c1-b672-432c-b556-5401be2bec5e">Indoctrination and propaganda</h2><p>The citizens of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> are indoctrinated and heavily influenced by propaganda.</p><p>To prevent children from developing into independent-thinking individuals, they are removed from the influence of their own parents at an early age in case these parents are critical of the system: "The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That's why we've lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're almost snatching them from the cradle." (Part 1, 71%). Nevertheless, when children or teenagers deviate from the norm, such as Clarisse, they are sent to a psychiatrist.</p><p>At school, the indoctrination in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> continues by strongly accustoming young people to mass media consumption. A lot of sports are played and there are many hours of televisionl. Those subjects that stimulate thinking, on the other hand, are neglected. The students hardly ask any questions; they are simply expected to learn facts by heart. If students ask questions about why (the reason for things) and not only about how (how to do something), this is considered dangerous, since such behavior allegedly leads to unhappiness.</p><p>Guy Montag, who at the beginning of the plot is completely subject to the indoctrination of the state, firmly believes that the fire department has always been there to start fires, not to put them out ). When doubts come to him and he inquires of his colleagues, they present him with the fire department's service regulations, which "contained brief histories of the Firemen of America" (Part 1, 42%). It states that <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Benjamin Franklin (1706 - 1790) was an American diplomat, scientist, inventor and writer. He was a co-founder of the United States and a co-signer of the Declaration of Independence.</p>">Benjamin Franklin</span> was the first firefighter.</p><p>The large consumption of media and especially the consumption of television promote this dumbing down of the people, which is illustrated in the novel by Mildred. When critical thinking is eliminated, it becomes particularly easy for the state to indoctrinate and manipulate the people (see section <a href="television-and-manipulation.html">"Television and Manipulation"</a>).</p><p>Another example of manipulation results from propaganda. A devastating atomic war threatens to break out. On the radio, war propaganda assures citizens that victory is certain, that it will be only a short war. War is portrayed as something positive , bringing to mind Nazi messages in World War II.</p><h2 id="heading-u2890" data-guid="a1f207f9-9048-40b0-ab9b-72f63bcac8d0">Control and fear</h2><p>The state monitors people who are suspected of hiding books, or even people who simply think differently.</p><p>Clarisse's family, the McClellans, for example, have a "record" (Part 1, 86%). Although books are never found in their house, the uncle is considered a loner. Captain Beatty refers to Clarisse as a "time bomb (ibid.): she is a critical thinker and this fact suggests that she was taught critical thinking in the family. The McClellans are characterized as dangerous dissidents because they are a family of thinkers who debate with each other and live a lifestyle that deviates from the norm.</p><p>People's personal freedom is severely restricted in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>. People's social behavior is controlled as far as possible from the outset: There used to be porches in front of the houses, but these are no longer built because the behavior of "people sitting like that, doing nothing, rocking, talking; that was the wrong kind of social life." (Part 1, 61%) is now suppressed: In this way, the state avoids people showing solidarity with one another. Isolated individuals are easier to control.</p><p>Walks are also undesirable, because during them people give free rein to their thoughts. Granger explains to Guy that people are observed by the police simply because they enjoy walking around outside: They are immediately classified as oddballs.</p><p>Special rules apply to car traffic. Clarisse's uncle, for example, "drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days." (Part 1, 8%).</p><p>Rebels are to be cured: Clarisse herself is to be driven out of independent thinking by therapy, although she feels well. She goes to a psychiatrist, but unwillingly: "They make me go." (Part 1, 21%).&nbsp;</p><p>In a state where there is no legal certainty and where it is easy to be denounced, citizens are afraid of the consequences if they go against regulations. Then they can lose not only their position and property, but also their lives, without at least being tried first.</p><p>When Guy brings books home and shows his wife his hidden books, Mildred feels fear. She fears losing her house, her car, and her comfortable lifestyle. She denounces her husband to the fire department save her own life, knowing full well what terrible consequences her report will have.</p><h2 id="heading-7e7kk" data-guid="96fa2633-415f-4a57-936f-8b7dc10b0b86">Conclusion</h2><p>The state in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> can be described as totalitarian and dictatorial, even though a fake election is arranged. The state rules arbitrarily and restricts the freedom of citizens through bans and censorship. Citizens are indoctrinated, monitored, and controlled.

Mildred and her friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, are talking about the last election. Mrs. Bowles tells them that she voted for President Noble, \u0022same as everyone,\u0022 because he was \u0022one of the nicest-looking men who ever became president.\u0022 (Part 2, 67%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe women then gossip about the opposing candidate, who was \u0022 small and homely\u0022 unshaven and with a bad haircut (Part 2, 67%). They are clear that \u0022the Outs(...) don\u0027t go running a little short man like that against a tall man\u0022 (Part 2, 67%f.).\u0026nbsp;He was, moreover, \u0026ldquo;fat\u0026rdquo; and had an unclear pronunciation, and therefore one would hardly have heard what he said, \u0022and the words I did hear I didn\u0027t understand!\u0022 (Part 2, 69%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike all other citizens, the women chose the most handsome presidential candidate. For example, the women were particularly struck by the fact that the opposing candidate, Hoag, was constantly picking his nose while he was on the screens in the TV room (Part 2, 69%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted at this point that the women are not particularly interested in the ideas of the two candidates in the discussion. The possible differences between their political intentions are not discussed by the women. The citizens in \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e prefer not to ask questions and avoid conflict in order to remain permanently happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the name and image of the two presidential candidates contrast completely. President \u0022Winston Noble\u0022 (whose surname is supposed to suggest how distinguished he is) ran against \u0022Hubert Hoag\u0022 (a hoagie is the American term for a giant sandwich). Noble is tall and handsome, while Hoag is short and fat, so he could not win the election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two-party system in \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e turns out to be a \u003cstrong\u003efalse democracy\u003c/strong\u003e. Two parodied candidates run and are elected on the basis of their appearance rather than their program. \u003cstrong\u003eThe election result seems to be fixed in advance\u003c/strong\u003e. Free elections thus do not seem to guarantee that a state is a real democracy. \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003erelated to a dictatorship, a system of government that requires complete obedience to the state\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003eTotalitarian \u003c/span\u003esystems all over the world also arrange fictitious elections to create a democratic alibi for themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ardud\u0022 data-guid=\u00225bbfd704-983b-461b-9b96-b027991701a5\u0022\u003eWill of the people, prohibition, censorship and murder\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to Beatty, the book ban in \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e was not originally imposed by the state: \u0022 It didn\u0027t come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God.\u0022 (Part 1, 83%). Faber later confirms Beatty\u0027s statement when he declares, \u0022Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord.\u0022 (PART 2, 95%). Mass culture and entertainment have evolved into a dictatorship of dumbing down, which Beatty explains in a lengthy speech (Part 1, 70-87%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe state has now legalized the general popular practice of ignoring books and has tightened it with the help of \u003cstrong\u003ecensorship and prohibition\u003c/strong\u003e. For the state, this was a good opportunity to \u003cstrong\u003edestroy the sources of information\u003c/strong\u003e to the dissenters and further eliminate the criminal dissidents who own books. The books are now demonized: they are characterized as edged guns (Part 1, 85%), thus it is justified to destroy them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe laws are put into practice by force, at least with regard to the ban on the possession of books. In the past, the police took the residents who hid books out of their houses and taped their mouths shut in the process. Now firemen sometimes have to manage the people on their own. It is accepted that people who do not want to leave their books to the flames die. In \u0022\u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e, the fire department is both judicial and executive . It can also murder people without trial with the help of the Mechanical Hound (see analysis \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003ehttps://primestudyguides.com/fahrenheit-451/analysis/symbols#heading-3x4em\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003e\u0022The Mechanical Hound\u0022\u003c/span\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, to cover up the failure of the system and to portray the infallibility of the state, the police and firemen do not hesitate to pass off an innocent man as Guy Montag and execute him after the real Guy Montag escapes from the police.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5awgc\u0022 data-guid=\u00223f0832c1-b672-432c-b556-5401be2bec5e\u0022\u003eIndoctrination and propaganda\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe citizens of \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e are indoctrinated and heavily influenced by propaganda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo prevent children from developing into independent-thinking individuals, they are removed from the influence of their own parents at an early age in case these parents are critical of the system: \u0022The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we\u0027re almost snatching them from the cradle.\u0022 (Part 1, 71%). Nevertheless, when children or teenagers deviate from the norm, such as Clarisse, they are sent to a psychiatrist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt school, the indoctrination in \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e continues by strongly accustoming young people to mass media consumption. A lot of sports are played and there are many hours of televisionl. Those subjects that stimulate thinking, on the other hand, are neglected. The students hardly ask any questions; they are simply expected to learn facts by heart. If students ask questions about why (the reason for things) and not only about how (how to do something), this is considered dangerous, since such behavior allegedly leads to unhappiness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuy Montag, who at the beginning of the plot is completely subject to the indoctrination of the state, firmly believes that the fire department has always been there to start fires, not to put them out ). When doubts come to him and he inquires of his colleagues, they present him with the fire department\u0027s service regulations, which \u0022contained brief histories of the Firemen of America\u0022 (Part 1, 42%). It states that \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eBenjamin Franklin (1706 - 1790) was an American diplomat, scientist, inventor and writer. He was a co-founder of the United States and a co-signer of the Declaration of Independence.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003eBenjamin Franklin\u003c/span\u003e was the first firefighter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe large consumption of media and especially the consumption of television promote this dumbing down of the people, which is illustrated in the novel by Mildred. When critical thinking is eliminated, it becomes particularly easy for the state to indoctrinate and manipulate the people (see section \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451/themes/television-and-manipulation\u0022\u003e\u0022Television and Manipulation\u0022\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example of manipulation results from propaganda. A devastating atomic war threatens to break out. On the radio, war propaganda assures citizens that victory is certain, that it will be only a short war. War is portrayed as something positive , bringing to mind Nazi messages in World War II.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-u2890\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a1f207f9-9048-40b0-ab9b-72f63bcac8d0\u0022\u003eControl and fear\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe state monitors people who are suspected of hiding books, or even people who simply think differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClarisse\u0027s family, the McClellans, for example, have a \u0022record\u0022 (Part 1, 86%). Although books are never found in their house, the uncle is considered a loner. Captain Beatty refers to Clarisse as a \u0022time bomb (ibid.): she is a critical thinker and this fact suggests that she was taught critical thinking in the family. The McClellans are characterized as dangerous dissidents because they are a family of thinkers who debate with each other and live a lifestyle that deviates from the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople\u0027s personal freedom is severely restricted in \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e. People\u0027s social behavior is controlled as far as possible from the outset: There used to be porches in front of the houses, but these are no longer built because the behavior of \u0022people sitting like that, doing nothing, rocking, talking; that was the wrong kind of social life.\u0022 (Part 1, 61%) is now suppressed: In this way, the state avoids people showing solidarity with one another. Isolated individuals are easier to control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalks are also undesirable, because during them people give free rein to their thoughts. Granger explains to Guy that people are observed by the police simply because they enjoy walking around outside: They are immediately classified as oddballs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpecial rules apply to car traffic. Clarisse\u0027s uncle, for example, \u0022drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days.\u0022 (Part 1, 8%).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRebels are to be cured: Clarisse herself is to be driven out of independent thinking by therapy, although she feels well. She goes to a psychiatrist, but unwillingly: \u0022They make me go.\u0022 (Part 1, 21%).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a state where there is no legal certainty and where it is easy to be denounced, citizens are afraid of the consequences if they go against regulations. Then they can lose not only their position and property, but also their lives, without at least being tried first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Guy brings books home and shows his wife his hidden books, Mildred feels fear. She fears losing her house, her car, and her comfortable lifestyle. She denounces her husband to the fire department save her own life, knowing full well what terrible consequences her report will have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7e7kk\u0022 data-guid=\u002296fa2633-415f-4a57-936f-8b7dc10b0b86\u0022\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe state in \u003ci\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/i\u003e can be described as totalitarian and dictatorial, even though a fake election is arranged. The state rules arbitrarily and restricts the freedom of citizens through bans and censorship. Citizens are indoctrinated, monitored, and controlled. They seem to live in a permanent state of happiness and are always very busy or entertained, but they live without legal security and must fear for their lives at all times, should they violate the social order.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Fahrenheit 451 | Democracy and dictatorship","MetaDescription":"The most important element of a democracy, namely free elections, exists in the novel Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.
