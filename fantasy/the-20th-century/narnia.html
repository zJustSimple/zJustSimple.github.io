S. Lewis, consisting of seven volumes. It tells the story of the kingdom of Narnia. The various protagonists are typically children from our world who are called to Narnia to help out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">The individual book has <strong>a circular plot structure</strong> as it follows the home-away-home structure, but the series as a whole also has a circular structure as we follow the creation, existence, and destruction of Narnia.</span></p><h3 id="heading-jywkv"><i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> (1950)</h3><p><span style="color:#202122;">Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, have been evacuated to live with an old professor during World War II. They discover a wardrobe which leads to Narnia. The siblings learn that they are destined to help the lion Aslan save the kingdom from the White Witch.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">The Witch tempts Edmund into betraying his siblings and Aslan, but Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund. Due to ancient magic, Aslan is reborn. After a massive battle between good and evil, the siblings become kings and queens of Narnia.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-zyisb"><i>Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia&nbsp;</i>(1951)</h3><p><span style="color:#202122;">Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are called back to Narnia, entering from a railway station. One year has passed in the real world while 1,300 years have passed in Narnia. The children assist Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to Narnia, in defeating the evil King Miraz and his army of Telmarines. Aslan also reappears.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">In the end, the four siblings return to their own world. Peter and Susan state that they will now be too old to return to Narnia.</span></p><h3 id="heading-8m37r"><i>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i> (1952)</h3><p>Edmund and Lucy are staying with their annoying cousin, Eustace, when they are suddenly called to Narnia via a painting of a ship. Three years have passed in Narnia. The children agree to follow Caspian and a talking mouse, Reepicheep, on a dangerous <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A journey, which typically involves different settings and challenges.</p>">quest</span> to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia. On the journey, Eustace is unwillingly turned into a dragon for a while, and this scary experience makes him a much nicer person.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Aslan tells Edmund and Lucy that they will no longer be coming to Narnia. He comforts them by saying that he exists in their world, too, only under a different name, hinting that he is God.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-5a8v1"><i>The Silver Chair</i> (1953)</h3><p>A few months after the events of the previous book, Eustace and his classmate, Jill, are being chased by bullies. They suddenly end up in Aslan&rsquo;s Country, a Heaven-like place. Aslan tells the two to go to Narnia where decades have passed: They must find Caspian&rsquo;s lost son, Rilian. They are accompanied by Puddleglum, a magical creature.</p><p>The group travels to the world of Underland. Here, they free Rilian from an enchantment cast upon him by the Lady of the Green Kirtle. As King Caspian dies, Rilian becomes King of Narnia.</p><p>Eustace and Jill end up in Aslan&rsquo;s Country again. Aslan tells them that one day they will be allowed into his Country for good. Caspian is restored to youth and pays their world a visit to chase off their bullies.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-np0hb"><i>The Horse and his Boy&nbsp;</i>(1954)</h3><p>This volume takes place during the Narnian reign of the Pevensie siblings and is set entirely in the magical world.&nbsp;</p><p>The mistreated youngster Shasta and the talking horse Bree decide to escape from the land of Calormen to Narnia. They join up with Aravis, a young noblewoman, and her talking horse Hwin. On their journey, the group prevents an evil plan to force Queen Susan to marry Prince Rabadash of Calormen. The group is assisted by King Edmund, Queen Lucy, and Aslan.&nbsp;</p><p>Shasta eventually learns that he is the long-lost heir to the throne of Archenland, a neighboring kingdom to Narnia. He marries Aravis.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-wq0ss"><i>The Magician&rsquo;s Nephew </i>(1955)</h3><p>This volume is a prequel to the series as it presents the creation of Narnia and introduces characters. It is mainly set in various magical worlds. The time setting in the real world is 1900.&nbsp;</p><p>Two children from our world, Digory and Polly, are given magical rings by Digory&rsquo;s uncle and travel through magical worlds. They fight Queen Jadis (later the White Witch) and witness Aslan creating Narnia. Aslan asks Digory to pick a special apple. Jadis tries to tempt him into eating it as it will make him immortal, but he resists. When Polly and Digory return to their world, Digory is allowed to bring an apple to heal his sick mother.&nbsp;</p><p>The apple&rsquo;s core becomes a tree which Digory eventually makes into a wardrobe. This wardrobe and the adult Digory (the professor) later host the Pevensies in <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-mvi98"><i>The Last Battle</i> (1956)</h3><p>Jill and Eustace once again return to Narnia, summoned by King Tirian. The talking ape Shift is spreading evil as he has tricked Puzzle the donkey into dressing up as Aslan. As fighting breaks out, many Narnians are killed by their arch enemy the Calormenes and the evil Calormene god Tash. Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, and Lucy all arrive in Narnia, trying in vain to save the kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>As Narnia is lost, Aslan judges each creature, much like Judgment Day in the Bible. He allows the loyal ones to follow him and the children to the true, heaven-like Narnia, which is a wonderful new world without lies and evil. Aslan reveals to the children they can join him because they have in fact died in an accident in the real world.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-6cnph">Lewis and the creation of the series</h2><p><span style="color:#202122;">C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) was born in Ireland but spent his adult life in England where he taught English literature at Oxford University. He was a friend and colleague of J. R. R. Tolkien, author of </span><a href="the-lord-of-the-rings.html"><span style="color:#202122;"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></span></a><span style="color:#202122;"><i>&nbsp;</i>series. Both men were part of a literary group called <strong>The Inklings&nbsp;</strong>where the members would meet and discuss the fantasy novels they were currently working on.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Although Lewis was raised in a Christian family, he later became an <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A person who does not believe in any god.</p>">atheist</span>. However, he <strong>converted to Christianity</strong> in 1931. This strongly influenced his writing: His later <i>Narnia&nbsp;</i>series is considered an <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A story containing a number of symbols which makes it possible to interpret the entire story as an image of human life. Allegories are often used to deliver moral, religious, or political messages.</p>">allegory</span> of Christian events and characters, although Lewis first denied this.</p><p>Lewis had the idea for his Narnia tales long before he started writing them, but the seven volumes were published from 1950 to 1956. Although the series tells the story of Narnia <span style="color:#202122;">from its creation to its destruction, it <strong>does not do so&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>in chronological order</strong>. Later publishers have often changed the order of the books to make the time setting of the series chronological. Some fans have strong opinions on the correct reading order.</p><h2 id="heading-q8pys">Studying <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i></h2><p><span style="color:#202122;">The <i>Narnia</i> series is somewhat conservative in nature and mainly set in an imaginary secondary world resembling the Middle Ages. The protagonists are always children, and adulthood is generally not presented in a positive light. Today, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia&nbsp;</i>is often analyzed for its Christian content because it borrows heavily from the Bible.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-zxxtr">Conservative gender roles</h3><p><i>Narnia </i>reflects its 1950s context in the sense that several elements seem rather conservative or old-fashioned today. Particularly the portrayal of gender roles is analytically interesting. The series has often been criticized for <strong>portraying gender roles in a conservative way</strong>. In<i> The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, Susan flees into a tree and has to be rescued by her brother as she is close to fainting. Fleeing, screaming, and fainting are stereotypically feminine responses to danger.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the character of <strong>Susan</strong> is interesting to analyze. In <i>The Last Battle</i>, we learn that she is &ldquo;no longer a friend of Narnia&rdquo; because &ldquo;she&rsquo;s interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipsticks and invitations&rdquo;. Apparently, Susan has done the worst thing a child can do: grow up and discover sex. In 2004, fantasy author Neil Gaiman wrote the short story &ldquo;The Problem of Susan&rdquo;, which indirectly addresses the unkind way Lewis treats Susan as a character.</p><p>To be fair to Lewis, however, the series does contain strong female characters. For instance, Susan&rsquo;s sister, Lucy, is a very brave little girl who plays a leading role.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-06vll">Themes</h3><p>A major theme in the series is <strong>Christianity</strong> as well as the <strong>faith and sacrifice</strong> associated with religious belief. Lewis became a Christian before writing the series, and the seven books can generally be interpreted as <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A story containing a number of symbols which makes it possible to interpret the entire story as an image of human life. Allegories are often used to deliver moral, religious, or political messages.</p>">allegories</span> of events, characters, or messages from the Bible.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;</i>is about the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus (symbolized through the lion Aslan). Another example is <i>The Last Battle&nbsp;</i>which is about the end of the world and Judgment Day (symbolized by the destruction of Narnia and the creation of a better Narnia for those faithful to Aslan).&nbsp;</p><p>Other, more universal, themes are <strong>good vs. evil</strong> and <strong>life and death</strong>, which are both common in fantasy. In <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, Aslan sacrifices himself and dies to save Edmund who has betrayed him, much like Judas betrayed Jesus in the Bible. Aslan&rsquo;s good-hearted sacrifice is eventually rewarded as he is reborn, like Jesus Christ. Edmund is redeemed.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-xqcc3">Legacy and adaptations&nbsp;</h2><p><i>The Chronicles of Narnia&nbsp;</i>became incredibly <strong>popular</strong> right from the start, and the series has never been out of print. Many fantasy authors, such as J. K. Rowling, have stated the influence of Lewis&rsquo; books on their work.</p><p>Several of the volumes have been <strong>adapted&nbsp;</strong>into various media, such as cartoons, radio dramas, and movies.

In\u003ci\u003e The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\u003c/i\u003e, Susan flees into a tree and has to be rescued by her brother as she is close to fainting.

In \u003ci\u003eThe Last Battle\u003c/i\u003e, we learn that she is \u0026ldquo;no longer a friend of Narnia\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rsquo;s interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipsticks and invitations\u0026rdquo;.
