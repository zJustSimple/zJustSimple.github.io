R. R. Tolkien. It is about the </span><span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A journey, which typically involves different settings and challenges.</p>"><span style="color:#202122;">quest</span></span><span style="color:#202122;"> to destroy the One Ring to prevent evil from taking over the world. The story is mainly told through the eyes of four hobbits (short, human-like beings with hairy feet).&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-qbkcq"><i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> (1954)</h3><p>Frodo, a hobbit living in the Shire, is given a magical ring by his older cousin Bilbo. Through the wizard Gandalf, Frodo learns that it is the One Ring - a powerful ring created by Sauron, with the potential to turn its bearer evil and destroy the free world.&nbsp;</p><p>Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom to destroy it and eventually gets eight traveling fellows: his three hobbit friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the two men Boromir and Aragorn; the elf Legolas; the dwarf Gimli; and Gandalf.&nbsp;</p><p>They are constantly pursued by the nine Black Riders as well as the chief wizard Saruman and his brutal orcs. Gandalf is killed. When Boromir tries to take the Ring of Power, Frodo leaves the fellowship with Sam, not trusting anyone else.</p><h3 id="heading-rctjc"><i>The Two Towers&nbsp;</i>(1954)</h3><p>Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to protect Merry and Pippin. Gandalf comes back from the dead as chief wizard and strips Saruman of his powers. Merry and Pippin have the tree-like giants called ents destroy Saruman&rsquo;s headquarters. The fellowship then helps defeat Saruman&rsquo;s orc army in the battle of Helm&rsquo;s Deep.</p><p>Frodo and Sam meet Gollum, a tragic creature obsessed with the Ring. He becomes their guide, but his desire for the Ring makes him betray them: He leads them into the cave of a giant spider. As a wounded Frodo is found by orcs, Sam takes the Ring.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-tfp51"><i>The Return of the King&nbsp;</i>(1955)</h3><p><span style="color:#202122;">Wanting his Ring back, Sauron sends an army against Gondor, home of the late Boromir and his brother, Faramir. Aragorn and the rest of the fellowship help defeat the army, buying Frodo and Sam some time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">Sam helps Frodo escape and give the Ring back to him. When they finally reach Mount Doom, Frodo gives in to the Ring&rsquo;s power and puts it on. Gollum appears and takes it, but falls into the fires of the mountain. As the Ring is destroyed, so is Sauron&rsquo;s power.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">Aragorn becomes King of Gondor and marries Arwen, an elf princess. The four hobbits return to the Shire, only to discover that they must first drive away Saruman and his followers who have taken over their home. Saruman is killed and harmony restored. Frodo, however, is still affected by the burden of the Ring, and he eventually sails off with Gandalf and Bilbo to find peace.</span></p><h2 id="heading-9ww97">Tolkien and the creation of the series&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="color:#202122;">J. R. R. Tolkien (1892-1973) was very gifted at writing and reading at an early age, and he started <strong>creating his own languages&nbsp;</strong>in his teens. As an adult, Tolkien first worked at the <i>Oxford English Dictionary&nbsp;</i>before beginning an academic career at Oxford University where he taught English language and literature.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">He was close friends with another Oxford lecturer, C. S. Lewis, who was the author of </span><a href="https://liceunet.ro/fantasy/the-20th-century/narnia"><span style="color:#202122;"><i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i></span></a><span style="color:#202122;"><i>&nbsp;</i>series. Both men were part of <strong>The Inklings</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a literary group where the members would meet and discuss the fantasy novels they were currently working on. Tolkien, who was a Catholic, also inspired Lewis to convert to Christianity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">Using his knowledge of history and languages, Tolkien published his first fantasy novel in 1937: <i>The Hobbit</i>. This children&rsquo;s story takes place in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The later trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>(1954-1955) was more sinister in tone and took several years to finish.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id="heading-q8r4n">Studying <i>The Lord of the Rings</i></h2><p><i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>is set completely in a <a href="https://liceunet.ro/fantasy/analysis/what-to-analyze#heading-357px">secondary world</a>, Middle-earth, which resembles the Middle Ages. The series reflects Tolkien&rsquo;s fascination with the past as a time when things were better. <span style="color:#202122;">Due to the old-fashioned language of the books, they appear a bit hard to read today, which may be part of the reason why they are considered&nbsp;</span>adult fantasy.</p><h3 id="heading-08g5a">Comprehensive world building&nbsp;</h3><p><i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>is a great example of <strong>world building</strong>: the creation of an entire fictional world. This is a common feature in fantasy literature. Tolkien is widely admired (and analyzed) for creating one of the most comprehensive fantasy worlds ever. <span style="color:#202122;">For all the books, he used his academic knowledge of mythology, </span><span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>The study of the history and development of languages.</p>"><span style="color:#202122;">philology</span></span><span style="color:#202122;">, and languages (such as Old Norse, Old English, and Celtic) to create an entire world for his characters from scratch. He even invented languages.</span></p><p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the series is the fact that Tolkien went to such lengths <strong>to keep the illusion that this fictional world is real</strong>. This is seen by the fact that there is no primary world in the series; we never leave Middle-earth and are never reminded that this is just a fictional place. Bizarrely, Tolkien even claimed that <span style="color:#202122;">his imaginary world was in fact the real world in the past.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">The illusion of reality is also supported by the maps, illustrations, and appendices with background information which the books contain. These help legitimize the fictional world to us.</span></p><h3 id="heading-japxu">Medieval nostalgia</h3><p>Furthermore, <i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>expresses a<strong> nostalgic longing for the pre-industrialized past</strong> when everything was perhaps simpler and purer. This is seen by <span style="color:#202122;">Middle-earth&rsquo;s likeness to the Middle Ages: People travel on horseback, some of the characters are kings or knights, and old-fashioned virtues like loyalty, sacrifice, and bravery are idealized.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">The nostalgia is also seen by the fact that the series seems to be inspired by old literary genres such as fairy tales and&nbsp;</span>medieval romances. For example, <span style="color:#202122;">the characters are often either<i>&nbsp;</i>good or<i>&nbsp;</i>evil. Frodo is good and humble while Sauron is evil and power-hungry. The ending of the series is also classic: Good overcomes evil, and&nbsp;</span>Aragorn is crowned as king and marries a beautiful noblewoman.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the ending also has sad elements. Frodo never recovers from carrying the Ring for so long, and his decision to leave the Shire may be read as a symbolic death. Thus, the hero has truly sacrificed himself for the greater good.</p><h3 id="heading-rihwh">Archaic style</h3><p><i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>is written in an archaic style, which means that <strong>the language is old-fashioned</strong>. One example is this passage from <i>The Two Towers&nbsp;</i>spoken by Aragorn:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said Aragorn. [...] &lsquo;Now the Company is all in ruin. It is I that have failed. Vain was Gandalf&rsquo;s trust in me. What shall I do now?</p></blockquote><p>Phrases like &ldquo;alas&rdquo; and &ldquo;it is I&rdquo; make it seem old-fashioned. The same goes for the word order in &ldquo;vain was Gandalf&rsquo;s trust&hellip;&rdquo;. In his series, Tolkien deliberately mimics the language of medieval romances: A horse may be called &ldquo;a steed&rdquo;, the enemy may be &ldquo;the foe&rdquo;, and to die is &ldquo;to perish&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The old-style words may put some modern readers off because this type of language can seem stiff and complicated. However, it is a classic fantasy feature to copy medieval language, especially in <a href="https://liceunet.ro/fantasy/definition#heading-9qo5j">high fantasy</a>, and in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> it helps underline the setting.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-fxhv1">Old-fashioned (male) characters</h3><p>The archaic style is also seen by the characters who<strong> resemble archetypes</strong>. An archetype is a character-type that is commonly seen in literature, such as the wizard or the evil stepmother. In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Aragorn resembles the archetypal heroic knight or king, while Gandalf is the archetypal wise old wizard. This helps the readers work out who the characters are and whether they are good or evil. In turn, Tolkien&rsquo;s series itself would go on to inspire future works of fantasy.</p><p>Another striking feature of Tolkien&rsquo;s novels is that there are <strong>almost no female characters</strong>. For instance, the fellowship consists entirely of nine males. Women often seem to be a sort of prize for the heroes: In the ending, Sam marries Rosie from the Shire while Aragorn marries his elf princess. When the books were later made into movies, minor female characters like Arwen and &Eacute;owyn were given greater importance to appeal to modern viewers.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-f1dbc">Themes</h3><p>Certain universal themes can be identified in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. One is that of <strong>glory and</strong> <strong>honor</strong>, which is closely linked to the series&rsquo; fascination with medieval romances. Tolkien&rsquo;s series is basically a story about heroes who win glory and honor by fighting bravely against evil and sacrificing themselves for the greater cause.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to fairy tales and some older fantasy stories, glory and honor is not gained by finding a treasure of some sort. <i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>is about <i>getting rid of</i> a treasure (the Ring of Power).</p><p>Another universal theme is <strong>good vs. evil</strong>, which is common in fantasy. In the end, Sauron&rsquo;s evil is overcome, but at great personal costs to the heroes.</p><p>A third theme is <strong>the danger of power</strong>. Each of Sauron&rsquo;s magical Rings is so powerful that the wearer is constantly in danger of being corrupted. Even a humble anti-hero like Frodo cannot escape its magic: After resisting over the course of three books, the Ring tempts him into seeking its power instead of destroying it.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, <strong>war </strong>is also a potential theme. Tolkien took part in WW1 when he was young, and <i>The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</i>was written around the time of WW2. Some argue that the series is inspired by these wars. For example, the Rings may be read as a symbol of world domination; the courage and friendship of ordinary hobbits may symbolize soldiers of war; and the mass mobilization of orcs may resemble German mobilization in the world wars.</p><h2 id="heading-bd1iz">Legacy and adaptations&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="color:#202122;">Tolkien&rsquo;s trilogy became incredibly popular - especially among young people in the 1960s when paperback editions came out. Many works of fantasy, as well as role-playing games, have been inspired by Tolkien&rsquo;s books, which is why Tolkien is often referred to as <strong>the father of modern fantasy</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">The trilogy has been <strong>adapted </strong>into various media types such as radio and movies. The most successful adaptation so far has been Peter Jackson&rsquo;s film trilogy: <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&nbsp;</i>(2001), <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&nbsp;</i>(2002), and <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&nbsp;</i>(2003). The movies won several Oscars.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">Amazon is currently preparing a TV series set in an age before the one which Tolkien&rsquo;s trilogy<i>&nbsp;</i>takes place in, meaning that some of the settings and characters will be familiar. The title will be <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</i>.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/fantasy/the-20th-century/narnia" title="Fantasy | The Chronicles of Narnia" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Chronicles of Narnia</span></a><a href="/fantasy/the-20th-century/harry-potter" title="Fantasy | Harry Potter" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Harry Potter</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

This is a common feature in fantasy literature. Tolkien is widely admired (and analyzed) for creating one of the most comprehensive fantasy worlds ever. \u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003eFor all the books, he used his academic knowledge of mythology, \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eThe study of the history and development of languages.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003ephilology\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003e, and languages (such as Old Norse, Old English, and Celtic) to create an entire world for his characters from scratch. He even invented languages.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most striking feature of the series is the fact that Tolkien went to such lengths \u003cstrong\u003eto keep the illusion that this fictional world is real\u003c/strong\u003e. This is seen by the fact that there is no primary world in the series; we never leave Middle-earth and are never reminded that this is just a fictional place. Bizarrely, Tolkien even claimed that \u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003ehis imaginary world was in fact the real world in the past.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003eThe illusion of reality is also supported by the maps, illustrations, and appendices with background information which the books contain.

This is seen by \u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003eMiddle-earth\u0026rsquo;s likeness to the Middle Ages: People travel on horseback, some of the characters are kings or knights, and old-fashioned virtues like loyalty, sacrifice, and bravery are idealized.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003eThe nostalgia is also seen by the fact that the series seems to be inspired by old literary genres such as fairy tales and\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003emedieval romances. For example, \u003cspan style=\u0022color:#202122;\u0022\u003ethe characters are often either\u003ci\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003egood or\u003ci\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eevil.

Frodo never recovers from carrying the Ring for so long, and his decision to leave the Shire may be read as a symbolic death. Thus, the hero has truly sacrificed himself for the greater good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-rihwh\u0022\u003eArchaic style\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eis written in an archaic style, which means that \u003cstrong\u003ethe language is old-fashioned\u003c/strong\u003e. One example is this passage from \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003espoken by Aragorn:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Alas!\u0026rsquo; said Aragorn.

What shall I do now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhrases like \u0026ldquo;alas\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;it is I\u0026rdquo; make it seem old-fashioned. The same goes for the word order in \u0026ldquo;vain was Gandalf\u0026rsquo;s trust\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. In his series, Tolkien deliberately mimics the language of medieval romances: A horse may be called \u0026ldquo;a steed\u0026rdquo;, the enemy may be \u0026ldquo;the foe\u0026rdquo;, and to die is \u0026ldquo;to perish\u0026rdquo;.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe old-style words may put some modern readers off because this type of language can seem stiff and complicated.

An archetype is a character-type that is commonly seen in literature, such as the wizard or the evil stepmother. In \u003ci\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u003c/i\u003e, Aragorn resembles the archetypal heroic knight or king, while Gandalf is the archetypal wise old wizard. This helps the readers work out who the characters are and whether they are good or evil. In turn, Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s series itself would go on to inspire future works of fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother striking feature of Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s novels is that there are \u003cstrong\u003ealmost no female characters\u003c/strong\u003e. For instance, the fellowship consists entirely of nine males. Women often seem to be a sort of prize for the heroes: In the ending, Sam marries Rosie from the Shire while Aragorn marries his elf princess. When the books were later made into movies, minor female characters like Arwen and \u0026Eacute;owyn were given greater importance to appeal to modern viewers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-f1dbc\u0022\u003eThemes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCertain universal themes can be identified in \u003ci\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u003c/i\u003e. One is that of \u003cstrong\u003eglory and\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ehonor\u003c/strong\u003e, which is closely linked to the series\u0026rsquo; fascination with medieval romances. Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s series is basically a story about heroes who win glory and honor by fighting bravely against evil and sacrificing themselves for the greater cause.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContrary to fairy tales and some older fantasy stories, glory and honor is not gained by finding a treasure of some sort. \u003ci\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eis about \u003ci\u003egetting rid of\u003c/i\u003e a treasure (the Ring of Power).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother universal theme is \u003cstrong\u003egood vs. evil\u003c/strong\u003e, which is common in fantasy. In the end, Sauron\u0026rsquo;s evil is overcome, but at great personal costs to the heroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA third theme is \u003cstrong\u003ethe danger of power\u003c/strong\u003e.
