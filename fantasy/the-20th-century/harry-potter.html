K. Rowling consists of seven volumes aimed at children and teenagers. Harry, an orphan boy, discovers that he has magical powers and is destined to kill Voldemort, an evil wizard threatening both the magical and human worlds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#202122;">Each book has <strong>a circular plot structure</strong> as Harry starts out living at his aunt and uncle&rsquo;s house in the </span><a href="../analysis/what-to-analyze.html"><span style="color:#202122;">primary world</span> </a><span style="color:#202122;">before going to wizard school in the </span><a href="../analysis/what-to-analyze.html"><span style="color:#202122;">secondary world</span> </a><span style="color:#202122;">, only to return to his relatives at the end of the school year. The series as a whole also ends with a circular element as we see adult Harry waving off his son to Hogwarts, thus signaling an on-going cycle.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-0rjwu"><i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone&nbsp;</i>(1997)</h3><p>Harry lives with his mean relatives, the Dursleys. On his 11th birthday, he discovers that he is a wizard and is famous for surviving an attack by Lord Voldemort that killed his parents. The event left a lightning bolt scar on Harry&rsquo;s forehead. Voldemort&rsquo;s power was ended, and the evil wizard was left as a sort of spirit without a body.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry accesses the wizarding world via a magical <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A magical entrance or gateway.</p>">portal</span> called Platform 9 ¾ at the train station. He enrolls at Hogwarts, a wizard school, where he makes friends with Ron and Hermione and the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. He also makes enemies: fellow student Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape.</p><p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione find out that the magical philosopher&rsquo;s stone is hidden at the school and that Voldemort is about to steal it to restore his body. In a dramatic struggle with professor Quirrell, who is controlled by Voldemort, Harry manages to keep Voldemort from gaining power again.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-twtsp"><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&nbsp;</i>(1998)</h3><p>Harry is warned about returning to Hogwarts by Dobby, an enslaved house elf. Ignoring this, Harry eventually arrives at the school with Ron in Ron&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s flying car.&nbsp;</p><p>However, something called the Chamber of Secrets has been opened somewhere in the school, and a monster has escaped, terrorizing the school. Harry, Hermione, and Ron find a diary belonging to Tom Riddle, a former student. Then, Hermione is paralyzed by the monster and Ron&rsquo;s sister Ginny taken into the Chamber. The boys realize the monster is a basilisk, a giant snake which can kill or petrify people with its gaze.&nbsp;</p><p>The boys find a way to access the Chamber. It turns out that Tom Riddle is in fact Voldemort who controls the basilisk. After a wild fight where Harry is almost killed, he defeats the evil wizard again, and Hermione and Ginny are saved.</p><h3 id="heading-hz4qm"><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&nbsp;</i>(1999)</h3><p>Hogwarts is in a state of alert because Sirius Black has escaped the prison of Azkaban; he is thought to have betrayed Harry&rsquo;s parents to Voldemort when they were killed.</p><p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Lupin discover that Harry&rsquo;s parents were really betrayed by Pettigrew, who is Voldemort&rsquo;s servant. Pettigrew <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>To make it look as if someone else committed a crime.</p>">framed</span>Black and has been hiding in the shape of Ron&rsquo;s pet rat ever since. Harry learns that Pettigrew, Lupin, Black, and Harry&rsquo;s father were close friends and could turn themselves into animals. He also learns of the hateful relationship between his father and Professor Snape, which explains why Snape is always hostile towards Harry.</p><p>Unfortunately, Pettigrew now escapes, and Black is captured. Using Hermione&rsquo;s magical time-turner, Harry, Ron, Hermione go back in time and help Black escape. He is Harry&rsquo;s godfather, meaning Harry&rsquo;s has gained more family.</p><h3 id="heading-p6uk8"><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&nbsp;</i>(2000)</h3><p>Harry, Hermione, and Ron with his family attend the <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A game where players fly on broomsticks.</p>">Quidditch</span> World Cup. It ends in mass panic as Voldemort&rsquo;s Dark Mark appears in the sky signaling his return.</p><p>Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Tournament and Harry is surprisingly selected to represent the school along with Cedric, a popular student. Many think Harry is doing this to gain fame, which temporarily destroys Harry and Ron&rsquo;s friendship. In the end, Harry and Cedric reach the Cup together. However, because of Voldemort&rsquo;s magic, they are transported to a graveyard where Pettigrew kills Cedric. Harry battles Voldemort and escapes back to Hogwarts with Cedric&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Voldemort did not succeed in killing Harry, he has been <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Revitalized or brought back from the dead.</p>">resurrected</span>using Harry&rsquo;s blood. Some in the wizarding community are horrified, while others refuse to believe Voldemort is back.</p><h3 id="heading-mets4"><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&nbsp;</i>(2003)</h3><p>A teenage moody Harry joins the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization fighting against Voldemort. Harry distrusts fellow member Professor Snape, thinking he is a Death Eater.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ministry of Magic refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned and appoints Dolores Umbridge as headmistress at Hogwarts. She is supposed to repress the belief that Voldemort is back, as this would make the Ministry look bad.</p><p>Harry and some of his friends are lured to the Ministry where Sirius is tragically killed by a Death Eater. However, Dumbledore, the Order, and Harry manage to drive Voldemort. The Ministry is now forced to accept that he has returned. As Harry is grieving for Sirius, Dumbledore reveals a shocking prophecy about Harry and Voldemort which states that one must kill the other.</p><h3 id="heading-y760q"><i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&nbsp;</i>(2005)</h3><p>Harry finds a <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A school subject which teaches wizard students to mix magical liquids that might for instance harm or heal people.</p>">Potions</span> textbook with notes by a mysterious &ldquo;Half-Blood Prince&rdquo; and uncritically uses it to excel in class.</p><p>Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into six pieces and hidden these in various objects - horcruxes. The horcruxes must be found and destroyed to kill him for good. Only four of these remain. Dumbledore takes Harry along to destroy a horcrux in a lake. They succeed, but Dumbledore is permanently weakened.&nbsp;</p><p>Death Eaters attack Hogwarts. Draco reveals that he has been charged with killing Dumbledore but cannot bring himself to do it. Instead, Snape kills Dumbledore in front of a horrified Harry and also reveals to him that he, Snape, was the Half-Blood Prince. Snape then escapes.</p><p>Harry discovers that the lake horcrux was a fake. He decides not to return to school for his final year as he wants to find the four remaining horcruxes with Ron and Hermione. He also breaks up with his girlfriend Ginny to keep her safe.</p><h3 id="heading-f8pm9"><i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&nbsp;</i>(2007)</h3><p>Evil is spreading as Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on a dangerous <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A journey, which typically involves different settings and challenges.</p>">quest</span> to find horcruxes, using magical gifts they each got from Dumbledore. They learn of the Deathly Hallows - three magical items that enable you to master death.&nbsp;</p><p>Their quest culminates in another battle with Voldemort and the Death Eaters at Hogwarts. Snape is killed by Voldemort but reveals to Harry that he was always loyal to Dumbledore and that Dumbledore arranged his own death as he was dying anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>With all six horcruxes destroyed, Harry realizes that <i>he&nbsp;</i>is an additional horcrux, unknown to Voldemort. As Voldemort attacked Harry as a baby, a piece of the evil wizard&rsquo;s soul was left in the boy. Harry decides to sacrifice himself and allows the evil wizard to kill him. In death, Harry is reunited with Dumbledore before being restored to life. He then kills Voldemort.</p><p>The book ends with <strong>an </strong><span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A section at the end of a book that serves as a conclusion to the story. It is often set at a later time than the rest of the story.</p>"><strong>epilogue</strong></span> set nineteen years later. We learn that Harry and Ginny have three children while Ron and Hermione have two. They are happily waving off their children who are going to Hogwarts.</p><h2 id="heading-mkoag">Rowling and the creation of the series</h2><p>Joanne Rowling was born in England in 1965 and went on to study French. She has claimed that the idea of the series and Harry as a character just &ldquo;wandered into her head&rdquo; fully formed while waiting for a train. She wrote the first book while living in Scotland as a single, divorced parent on welfare. As the series grew in popularity, so did her fortune, eventually making her one of highest-paid authors ever. Therefore, Rowling&rsquo;s personal story has often been presented as a &lsquo;rags to riches&rsquo; story.</p><p>Rowling published the books under her pen name, J. K. Rowling. Her publisher was worried that boys would not want to read the series if the author&rsquo;s name looked female.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-i82tl">Studying <i>Harry Potter</i></h2><p>In terms of setting, <i>Harry Potter&nbsp;</i>uses the world-within-a-world approach: The wizarding world (the secondary one) exists within our world (the primary one) but is only accessible to magical people, for instance via portals.</p><p>Apart from the portrayal of worlds, <i>Harry Potter&nbsp;</i>is sometimes also analyzed for its use of other literary genres such as the school story.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-eb96q">The school story and the detective story</h3><p>Apart from the fantasy genre, <i>Harry Potter&nbsp;</i>draws on other, minor genres.<i>&nbsp;</i>One is the 19th century <strong>school story</strong> which focuses on school life - traditionally at English boarding schools. School stories frequently center around friendship or rivalry between the students as well as growing up.</p><p>Hogwarts is a boarding school, and the descriptions of the students&rsquo; meals, classes, and houses create a vivid image of boarding school life. The loyalty between Harry and his friends and the rivalry with their enemies also play an important role. Many fans highlight the description of life at Hogwarts as the series&rsquo; greatest attraction.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, Rowling&rsquo;s boarding school and the wizarding world that does not have modern inventions like cars or phones reflect the same longing for the past often seen in fantasy.</p><p>Another subgenre is <strong>the detective story</strong>. The <i>Harry Potter&nbsp;</i>series as a whole has elements of this, but particularly the first three books are constructed as detective stories where Harry and his companions must solve a mystery. For instance, in <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, the three friends are trying to figure out where the Chamber is, who opened it, and what kind of monster has escaped the Chamber. The use of the detective genre helps create tension and keep the readers interested.</p><h3 id="heading-fufqv">Themes</h3><p>According to Rowling herself, the main theme in the books is <strong>death</strong>. For example, Harry lost his parents and eventually dies himself, while Voldemort wants to escape death and live forever. Death is a common theme in fantasy.</p><p>A closely linked theme is that of <strong>sacrifice</strong>. Like a true fantasy hero, Harry realizes that he must sacrifice himself for the greater good. The same can be said for minor characters like Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape. Symbolically, these three characters can be seen as Jesus figures because they humbly offer up their own lives. This is in stark contrast to Voldemort who clings to his life. Voldemort&rsquo;s French-inspired name can be translated to something like &lsquo;flight from death&rsquo;, which hints at his desire and ability to escape death.</p><p>Other themes are <strong>class</strong> and <strong>race</strong>. Starting with class, Ron is embarrassed by his family&rsquo;s poverty and envies Harry&rsquo;s inherited wealth. Also, house elves are enslaved by humans. In terms of race, ancient wizarding families and Voldemort&rsquo;s Death Eaters look down upon wizards and witches like Hermione who were born of non-magical parents, calling them &ldquo;mudbloods&rdquo;. Particularly the racial views of the Death Eaters resemble those of the Nazis in WW2 Germany.</p><h2 id="heading-y24k2">Legacy and adaptations&nbsp;</h2><p>The <i>Harry Potter&nbsp;</i>series has received numerous nominations and awards, but the series&rsquo; most impressive feature is its enormous popularity. The books have been translated into more than 70 languages and have sold over 500 million copies worldwide. They seem to appeal to children, teenagers, and adults alike. A few religious groups have accused the books of promoting witchcraft and featuring immoral protagonists who lie, steal, and disobey adults.</p><p>Over time, the books have developed into <strong>a massive franchise</strong> which includes merchandise, theme parks, video games, and the eight successful <i>Harry Potter&nbsp;</i>movies produced by Warner Brothers from 2001 to 2011. The movies starred Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron. More recently, the spin-off movie series <i>Fantastic Beasts&nbsp;</i>(2016-ongoing) has also emerged.</p><p>In addition to the official franchise, there is the <i><strong>Harry Potter&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>fandom</strong>. Dedicated fans have created an enormous amount of content such as fan fiction, websites, podcasts, and festivals. Some of the words from the books, like &ldquo;muggle&rdquo;, have also made it into common English as well as the dictionary.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="the-lord-of-the-rings.html" title="Fantasy | The Lord of the Rings" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Lord of the Rings</span></a><a href="../the-21st-century.html" title="Fantasy in the 21st century" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Fantasy in the 21st century</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

She has claimed that the idea of the series and Harry as a character just \u0026ldquo;wandered into her head\u0026rdquo; fully formed while waiting for a train. She wrote the first book while living in Scotland as a single, divorced parent on welfare. As the series grew in popularity, so did her fortune, eventually making her one of highest-paid authors ever. Therefore, Rowling\u0026rsquo;s personal story has often been presented as a \u0026lsquo;rags to riches\u0026rsquo; story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRowling published the books under her pen name, J.

School stories frequently center around friendship or rivalry between the students as well as growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHogwarts is a boarding school, and the descriptions of the students\u0026rsquo; meals, classes, and houses create a vivid image of boarding school life. The loyalty between Harry and his friends and the rivalry with their enemies also play an important role. Many fans highlight the description of life at Hogwarts as the series\u0026rsquo; greatest attraction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, Rowling\u0026rsquo;s boarding school and the wizarding world that does not have modern inventions like cars or phones reflect the same longing for the past often seen in fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother subgenre is \u003cstrong\u003ethe detective story\u003c/strong\u003e. The \u003ci\u003eHarry Potter\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eseries as a whole has elements of this, but particularly the first three books are constructed as detective stories where Harry and his companions must solve a mystery. For instance, in \u003ci\u003eHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\u003c/i\u003e, the three friends are trying to figure out where the Chamber is, who opened it, and what kind of monster has escaped the Chamber. The use of the detective genre helps create tension and keep the readers interested.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-fufqv\u0022\u003eThemes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to Rowling herself, the main theme in the books is \u003cstrong\u003edeath\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, Harry lost his parents and eventually dies himself, while Voldemort wants to escape death and live forever. Death is a common theme in fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA closely linked theme is that of \u003cstrong\u003esacrifice\u003c/strong\u003e. Like a true fantasy hero, Harry realizes that he must sacrifice himself for the greater good. The same can be said for minor characters like Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape. Symbolically, these three characters can be seen as Jesus figures because they humbly offer up their own lives. This is in stark contrast to Voldemort who clings to his life. Voldemort\u0026rsquo;s French-inspired name can be translated to something like \u0026lsquo;flight from death\u0026rsquo;, which hints at his desire and ability to escape death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther themes are \u003cstrong\u003eclass\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003erace\u003c/strong\u003e. Starting with class, Ron is embarrassed by his family\u0026rsquo;s poverty and envies Harry\u0026rsquo;s inherited wealth. Also, house elves are enslaved by humans. In terms of race, ancient wizarding families and Voldemort\u0026rsquo;s Death Eaters look down upon wizards and witches like Hermione who were born of non-magical parents, calling them \u0026ldquo;mudbloods\u0026rdquo;. Particularly the racial views of the Death Eaters resemble those of the Nazis in WW2 Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-y24k2\u0022\u003eLegacy and adaptations\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ci\u003eHarry Potter\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eseries has received numerous nominations and awards, but the series\u0026rsquo; most impressive feature is its enormous popularity. The books have been translated into more than 70 languages and have sold over 500 million copies worldwide. They seem to appeal to children, teenagers, and adults alike. A few religious groups have accused the books of promoting witchcraft and featuring immoral protagonists who lie, steal, and disobey adults.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time, the books have developed into \u003cstrong\u003ea massive franchise\u003c/strong\u003e which includes merchandise, theme parks, video games, and the eight successful \u003ci\u003eHarry Potter\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003emovies produced by Warner Brothers from 2001 to 2011. The movies starred Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron. More recently, the spin-off movie series \u003ci\u003eFantastic Beasts\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003e(2016-ongoing) has also emerged.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the official franchise, there is the \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHarry Potter\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efandom\u003c/strong\u003e. Dedicated fans have created an enormous amount of content such as fan fiction, websites, podcasts, and festivals. Some of the words from the books, like \u0026ldquo;muggle\u0026rdquo;, have also made it into common English as well as the dictionary.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Fantasy | Harry Potter","MetaDescription":"The Harry Potter fantasy series (1997-2007) by J.
