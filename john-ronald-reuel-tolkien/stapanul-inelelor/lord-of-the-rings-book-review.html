J.R.R. Tolkien published the book for the first time in 1954 and 55. Today it has been turned into a massive brand, with movies, action figures and trading cards and much more, all taking place in the very setting, with the very characters Tolkien created. A lot of people have read the books, and saw the three movies, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, the interest for this universe, and the fantasy genre in general has not decreased. But what is it that makes this story, these characters, this world so fascinating?</p><p>First of all the narration takes place in a time where men wore swords, in a world similar to this one, with the exception of magic, exotic humanoids and monsters. These exceptions are some of the things that make the world in the story seem special and appealing to me at least, and I bet to many others. Tolkien uses a meticulously descriptive language that depicts how the scenery is, and what the roles in the story look like. His language is filled to the brim with a wide array of adjectives, and therefore the books are best read in ones native language. The understanding of how the characters in the story interfere with each other and with the environment is central to the understanding of the tale, and that is the reason for Tolkien's abundant use of adjectives. E.g.:</p><p><i>&ldquo;The change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tolkien's thoroughness doesn't even end here. He also created a whole language, <i><strong>elven</strong></i>, and a book to describe the universe in general (, the &ldquo;Genesis&rdquo; of his fictional world called Arda, in which Middle-Earth lies. His work is comprehensive, and it is a reason for his success. The multiple environments and atmospheres he creates make us create pictures of the scenes in the story. Be it the picturesque idyll of the Shire, the magnificent white city of Minas Tirith, or the barren plains of Gorgoroth, we all have images of what it looks like. Those mental images may be a work of our imagination, but today many people imagine themselves the scenery of the films. A lot of the places in his books are very similar to places in the real world. E.g. a shire is an administrative area in Britain, and the Shire itself also shares the landscape of the English country.</p><p>The general extensiveness is what impresses people, and it makes it easier for the reader to relate to the story, to get the sense that you take part in the tale. This identification with especially the characters but also the surroundings, is due to the traits Tolkien has given them, which reminds us of the things that surround us or something in our imagination. He has given each character in the story its own merits and flaws, which makes us think about them as our friends or at least reminds of something familiar. An example of such a character is the main protagonist, Frodo. Frodo is a hobbit, a halfling which is a kind of humanoid who stands about half our human size. Frodo is best portrayed through his actions and his courage, but Gandalf does leave a description of him to the owner of the inn the Prancing Pony, called Barliman Butterbur:</p><p><i>&ldquo;A choppy little guy, with red cheeks......But he is taller and brighter than most, and he has a cleft in his chin, he is a naughty chap with a twinkle in his eye&rdquo;</i></p><p>The description given here is not very personal. As mentioned before, the best way to portray him is by looking at what he does, and what he goes through while doing it. It wasn't easy for him to simply leave the Shire not knowing what to do, and being further away than he had ever been before. Plus, hobbits are quiet, easy-going people. They have a conservative way to look at things and thus adventure is not well-regarded in their society. This is e.g. shown in the movie, in the scene in &ldquo;The Fellowship of the Ring&rdquo; where Gandalf drives by the raking hobbit. The reaction of the hobbit is to give Gandalf an evil stare. Gandalf is here viewed upon as a troublemaker, an outsider that disturbs their peace. Frodo comes from a family that disturbs. His uncle is Bilbo Baggins, the leading character of the book &ldquo;The Hobbit&rdquo;, the first of Tolkien's book in this series. In The Hobbit, Bilbo leaves on an adventure with, among others, Gandalf, and it is in this quest he finds the Ring, which later on passes on to Frodo. This Ring is the central object of the tale, the very reason the story even takes place. Holding it is a grim obligation, which Frodo takes on without even asking a question. He understands what he has to do when they all meet in Rivendell. He undertakes the burden it is to resist the force of the Ring, and he ends up succeeding in his task (although he does actually fail in the end), and the ring is destroyed. His personality is the epitome of a hero. He is the most unusual of candidates to take the ring to Mount Doom, and yet he does it. His strength also has roots in his good friendship with Sam. Through the journey Sam supports him a lot, and their bond is almost unbreakable, until the interruption made by Gollum. It is certain that Frodo would not have been able to make the voyage without Sam.</p><p>This bond between the two, the friendship is one of the important themes in this story. A friend in need is a friend indeed, you could say, is a motto of this theme, and you can certainly say Sam is a friend when Frodo is in need. Their almost, unconditional brotherly love to one another is a beautiful thing, and when I think of Sam, I also get associations to my best friends. Furthermore there is the Fellowship of the Ring which shares a kind of love also, but across different ethnicities. The Fellowship is the group of people that decide to venture out of Rivendell, with the sole purpose of destroying the Ring. It consists of Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, the four hobbits from the shire, Aragorn, the striding, forgotten heir to the throne of Gondor, Boromir, the son of the Steward of Gondor, Legolas, an elven prince, Gimli, the dwarven Lord and finally Gandalf the magician. Altogether they make a varied band of soldiers with different qualities. Despite of their different races, native languages and general opinions they manage to get along. In the close of the story, they all end up becoming friends (those who survive that is). The death of Boromir and the whole scene means the end of the Fellowship. Boromir falls to the corruption of the Ring, and Frodo can no longer trust anyone but Sam. Boromir's degeneracy because of power also holds a strong point, a kind of lesson to the reader. It teaches us that a moral decline like his is among the worst things a man can do. The failure of these men that bowed to the temptations ultimately became the loosers. The way they changed the course of history by not refusing a simple emotion such as greed is right out frustrating for a reader. The Ring is the symbol of that greed. The greed to rule over everyone else. That is also why the title of the trilogy is so appropriate, The Lord of the Rings, the one who rules the rings that deceived the others. It contains the two &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; in the story at once, both the lord, Sauron, the creator of the ring, but also the ring itself, the shiny object that takes over the heart of men.</p><p>The <strong>conclusion </strong>is that there are several things that make these books so astonishing. I have not mentioned them all, but what I believed was most relevant. It is for certain that the vastness of what Tolkien created, along with his good narrative skills are central components in his recipe for success. The world he created was revolutionary, and is the main example for the whole fantasy genre today. But also the characters he created, that we can all relate to. They act with honour in tough times, they become inspirational. This is also why Tolkien has managed to get his books translated to over 38 languages, and god knows how many people have read them, or seen the films. The impact he has made is enormous and his books has been nominated to be one of the best series of books of all time.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/john-ronald-reuel-tolkien/stapanul-inelelor/rezumat" title="Stapanul inelelor | Rezumat" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span></a><a href="/john-ronald-reuel-tolkien/stapanul-inelelor/the-lord-of-the-rings-presentation" title="The Lord of the Rings - Presentation" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Lord of the Rings - Presentation</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

J.R.R. Tolkien published the book for the first time in 1954 and 55. Today it has been turned into a massive brand, with movies, action figures and trading cards and much more, all taking place in the very setting, with the very characters Tolkien created. A lot of people have read the books, and saw the three movies, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, the interest for this universe, and the fantasy genre in general has not decreased. But what is it that makes this story, these characters, this world so fascinating?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all the narration takes place in a time where men wore swords, in a world similar to this one, with the exception of magic, exotic humanoids and monsters. These exceptions are some of the things that make the world in the story seem special and appealing to me at least, and I bet to many others. Tolkien uses a meticulously descriptive language that depicts how the scenery is, and what the roles in the story look like. His language is filled to the brim with a wide array of adjectives, and therefore the books are best read in ones native language. The understanding of how the characters in the story interfere with each other and with the environment is central to the understanding of the tale, and that is the reason for Tolkien\u0027s abundant use of adjectives. E.g.:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0026ldquo;The change in the wizard\u0027s voice was astounding. Suddenly it became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTolkien\u0027s thoroughness doesn\u0027t even end here. He also created a whole language, \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eelven\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e, and a book to describe the universe in general (, the \u0026ldquo;Genesis\u0026rdquo; of his fictional world called Arda, in which Middle-Earth lies. His work is comprehensive, and it is a reason for his success. The multiple environments and atmospheres he creates make us create pictures of the scenes in the story. Be it the picturesque idyll of the Shire, the magnificent white city of Minas Tirith, or the barren plains of Gorgoroth, we all have images of what it looks like. Those mental images may be a work of our imagination, but today many people imagine themselves the scenery of the films. A lot of the places in his books are very similar to places in the real world. E.g. a shire is an administrative area in Britain, and the Shire itself also shares the landscape of the English country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe general extensiveness is what impresses people, and it makes it easier for the reader to relate to the story, to get the sense that you take part in the tale. This identification with especially the characters but also the surroundings, is due to the traits Tolkien has given them, which reminds us of the things that surround us or something in our imagination. He has given each character in the story its own merits and flaws, which makes us think about them as our friends or at least reminds of something familiar. An example of such a character is the main protagonist, Frodo. Frodo is a hobbit, a halfling which is a kind of humanoid who stands about half our human size. Frodo is best portrayed through his actions and his courage, but Gandalf does leave a description of him to the owner of the inn the Prancing Pony, called Barliman Butterbur:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0026ldquo;A choppy little guy, with red cheeks......But he is taller and brighter than most, and he has a cleft in his chin, he is a naughty chap with a twinkle in his eye\u0026rdquo;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe description given here is not very personal. As mentioned before, the best way to portray him is by looking at what he does, and what he goes through while doing it. It wasn\u0027t easy for him to simply leave the Shire not knowing what to do, and being further away than he had ever been before. Plus, hobbits are quiet, easy-going people. They have a conservative way to look at things and thus adventure is not well-regarded in their society. This is e.g. shown in the movie, in the scene in \u0026ldquo;The Fellowship of the Ring\u0026rdquo; where Gandalf drives by the raking hobbit. The reaction of the hobbit is to give Gandalf an evil stare. Gandalf is here viewed upon as a troublemaker, an outsider that disturbs their peace. Frodo comes from a family that disturbs. His uncle is Bilbo Baggins, the leading character of the book \u0026ldquo;The Hobbit\u0026rdquo;, the first of Tolkien\u0027s book in this series. In The Hobbit, Bilbo leaves on an adventure with, among others, Gandalf, and it is in this quest he finds the Ring, which later on passes on to Frodo. This Ring is the central object of the tale, the very reason the story even takes place. Holding it is a grim obligation, which Frodo takes on without even asking a question. He understands what he has to do when they all meet in Rivendell. He undertakes the burden it is to resist the force of the Ring, and he ends up succeeding in his task (although he does actually fail in the end), and the ring is destroyed. His personality is the epitome of a hero. He is the most unusual of candidates to take the ring to Mount Doom, and yet he does it. His strength also has roots in his good friendship with Sam. Through the journey Sam supports him a lot, and their bond is almost unbreakable, until the interruption made by Gollum. It is certain that Frodo would not have been able to make the voyage without Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis bond between the two, the friendship is one of the important themes in this story. A friend in need is a friend indeed, you could say, is a motto of this theme, and you can certainly say Sam is a friend when Frodo is in need. Their almost, unconditional brotherly love to one another is a beautiful thing, and when I think of Sam, I also get associations to my best friends. Furthermore there is the Fellowship of the Ring which shares a kind of love also, but across different ethnicities. The Fellowship is the group of people that decide to venture out of Rivendell, with the sole purpose of destroying the Ring. It consists of Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, the four hobbits from the shire, Aragorn, the striding, forgotten heir to the throne of Gondor, Boromir, the son of the Steward of Gondor, Legolas, an elven prince, Gimli, the dwarven Lord and finally Gandalf the magician. Altogether they make a varied band of soldiers with different qualities. Despite of their different races, native languages and general opinions they manage to get along. In the close of the story, they all end up becoming friends (those who survive that is). The death of Boromir and the whole scene means the end of the Fellowship. Boromir falls to the corruption of the Ring, and Frodo can no longer trust anyone but Sam. Boromir\u0027s degeneracy because of power also holds a strong point, a kind of lesson to the reader. It teaches us that a moral decline like his is among the worst things a man can do. The failure of these men that bowed to the temptations ultimately became the loosers. The way they changed the course of history by not refusing a simple emotion such as greed is right out frustrating for a reader. The Ring is the symbol of that greed. The greed to rule over everyone else. That is also why the title of the trilogy is so appropriate, The Lord of the Rings, the one who rules the rings that deceived the others. It contains the two \u0026ldquo;enemies\u0026rdquo; in the story at once, both the lord, Sauron, the creator of the ring, but also the ring itself, the shiny object that takes over the heart of men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003econclusion \u003c/strong\u003eis that there are several things that make these books so astonishing. I have not mentioned them all, but what I believed was most relevant. It is for certain that the vastness of what Tolkien created, along with his good narrative skills are central components in his recipe for success. The world he created was revolutionary, and is the main example for the whole fantasy genre today. But also the characters he created, that we can all relate to. They act with honour in tough times, they become inspirational. This is also why Tolkien has managed to get his books translated to over 38 languages, and god knows how many people have read them, or seen the films. The impact he has made is enormous and his books has been nominated to be one of the best series of books of all time.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The Lord of the Rings - Book review","MetaDescription":"The Lord of the Rings is undoubtedly one of the most popular trilogies of all time.
