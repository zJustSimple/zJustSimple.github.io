Tolkien: The Lord of the Rings - A trilogy</h1></header><div><p>The Tolkien trilogy in book form is more than 1000 pages. I guess that explains why this first of the three Rings trilogy is 170 minutes long! Three hours! But all is not lost in boredom. The story is relatively attention keeping though often dream-like. The scenery is breath taking. The computer aided choreography made this movie a masterpiece of its own and a tribute to technology. The blending of extremes of imagination with down to earth and believable emotions is masterful. The performers are obviously experienced and compatible with their parts. Such a combination of talents and skills to create an absorbable story is indeed an influence, which must be given diligent thought because this is another story of witchcraft, sorcery and wizardry. The luxury and enormity of this book-to-film is truly a challenger for your mind, <i>especially</i> the impressionable mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a middle-earth world, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) meets Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKlellan) as Gandalf travels to see Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) to find the 20th of 20 special rings: a ring that wants to be found. The 20 rings were created with special powers. One of the 20 rings, named "My Precious" by Gollum, possessed the power to give the wearer power of global proportion. Bilbo Baggins is in possession of the one ring. To save the world, the ring must be destroyed but it cannot be destroyed except by the same fires that fashioned it, the fires of Mount Doom. So that is what Frodo, Gandalf and seven additional characters, the Fellowship of the Ring, set out to do.</p><p>This is the start of a trilogy that can only be described as incredible. From the first moment to the last you will be captivated by this magical and distant world of Elves, Dwarves, Men, Orcs, Goblins, Wizards and most importantly Hobbits.</p><p>An undiscovered time in the history of a world foreign to ours is created. Even Elven languages can be heard and translated in this mystical environment. The scenery ranges from beautiful and inviting to desolate, but always keeps you absorbed in the air of the moment. From the Shire to Mordor Tolkien takes you on a quest that isn't easily forgotten. Nine members of the Fellowship are each about 3 or 4 feet high, yet played by normal sized actors. The monsters of J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination come to life in horrific and wonderful ways. This is a story of good vs. evil, with evil being all-powerful and good being generally 3 feet tall with hairy feet.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the three pieces of the Middle Earth puzzle, <i>The Two Towers</i> is the one with the biggest handicap. It is afflicted with the "middle chapter syndrome" &ndash; an inherent obstacle for the second episode of any trilogy. <i>The Two Towers</i> has no real beginning or end. It takes situations and characters introduced in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> and prepares them for <i>The Return of the King</i>. The trick is to immerse audiences "in the moment" and keep them from looking ahead. In nearly every way that counts, <i>The Two Towers</i> is <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>'s equal. In terms of tone, pacing, character development, plot advancement, and visual splendour, there is no drop-off. More importantly, the continuity is seamless, allowing a viewer familiar with the first movie to flow effortlessly into the second. Of course, therein lies a drawback, as well. <i>The Two Towers</i> cannot stand on its own. Familiarity with <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> is not just advisable. It is mandatory. Anyone attempting to watch <i>The Two Towers</i> without having seen (or read) the first instalment is headed for confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>The returning actors have grown nicely into their roles. There are changes, of course. Elijah Wood's Frodo is haunted and exhausted, relying more upon Sam. Wood's body language expresses the weight Frodo feels from bearing the ring. Viggo Mortensen's Aragon is a more heroic figure. Ian McKellan plays Gandalf with greater authority now that he has been transformed from a grey wizard to a white one. Newcomer Bernard Hill brings a sense of authority to Theoden. Miranda Otto is noble and strong as Eowyn. Brad Dourif is the slimy Grima Wormtongue, the servant of Sauruman who speaks poison into Theoden's ear. And, as Gollum, Andy Serkis (whose performance is overlaid with computer images) presents his twisted character as a strangely tragic and conflicted creature. We feel pity for Gollum.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Two Towers</i> essentially picks up where <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> concludes, though following a short flashback to the battle between the wizard Gandalf and the Balrog. In the first movie, when Gandalf tumbles from the bridge, we see him disappear into the abyss. In the second movie, however, we follow him as he and the Balrog tumble endlessly downward, continuing their struggle along the way. In the wake of his victory over his enemy, Gandalf is reborn as a white wizard, and returns to the world above to re-unite with his former companions. In the company of Aragon, Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), the wizard heads for the city of Rohan, where he hopes to convince the king, Th&eacute;oden (Bernard Hill), that war is upon his kingdom. At the same time, the hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), having escaped from their orc captors, flee into the forbidding Fanghorn Forest, where they come across Treebeard the Ent (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a giant shepherd of trees who decides to protect the two very small intruders. Meanwhile, to the East, Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) find themselves lost on their way to Mount Doom. And, in addition to suffering from the physical difficulties of such a difficult journey, Frodo is beginning to show the strain of bearing the ring, with the Dark Lord Sauron's threatening glare constantly seeking him. The creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), who has been following the hobbits, attempts to steal the ring from Frodo, but is captured. Thereafter, he reluctantly agrees to serve as Frodo and Sam's guide and take them to Mordor.&nbsp;</p><p>The stunning climax of <i>The Two Towers</i> is the battle of Helm's Deep &ndash; a 30-minute scene that features the blockade of a seemingly invincible stone fortress by an army of 10,000 creatures of Sauruman (Christopher Lee). Inside that fortress is a small force of several hundred humans and elves, led by Aragon, Theoden, Legolas, and Gimli. Although the attack occupies only a dozen pages of Tolkien's novel, Jackson has transformed it into the centrepiece of the film - an amazing, heart-stopping battle against impossible odds. Jackson has added dashes of amusement and romance to the film. Most of the humour, which is absolutely simple, involves Gimli, who occasionally seems to be around as much for comic relief as anything else. For example, in the middle of the battle of Helm's Deep, he is infuriated that his number of kills can't keep pace with Legolas'. On the romantic front, Aragon, who is promised to the elven princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), finds himself the object of attention for Th&eacute;oden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto). This sets up a triangle.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Two Towers</i> starts out a little slowly, but the rousing second half, which gathers energy like a rock racing downhill, will leave audiences craving more when the end credits roll. Combined, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> and <i>The Two Towers</i> represent one of the most engrossing and engaging six-hour segments of cinema I have ever enjoyed. Like its forerunner, <i>The Two Towers</i> is a great motion picture, and not to be missed by anyone who appreciates fantasy adventure.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</i> is the third movie from the trilogy<i> Lord of the Rings</i> and the final battle of good and evil takes place in Middle-earth. All good beings are gathered to fight the dark lord Sauron. The dark creatures sent from Sauron attacks the forces of men at the once great kingdom, Gondor. &nbsp;Now Gondor is led by Denethor (John Noble) the 26th Ruling Steward of Gondor, and the father of Farmir and Boromir.&nbsp;</p><p>Boromir died in the first movie because he could not resist the power of the ring while joining the fellowship. The fellowship is no longer together, Frodo and Sam are trying to reach Mount Doom, Gandalf and Pippin are at Gondor to help the marsk defending all evil of Sauron. Rohan&rsquo;s King Th&eacute;oden and his army with Merry and Eowyn among them, rides to Gondor.&nbsp;</p><p>Legolas and Gimli follow Aragorn through the path of death where Aragorn is to claim his heritage and become the King he was born to be. In every way Aragorn lives up to his title and with all the greatest skills a man can have, but can he really stand the evil of the dark lord. The movie flashes between the battle at Gondor and the quest of Frodo and Sam.&nbsp;</p><p>The closer Frodo gets to the fire of Mount Doom the heavier his burden, the Ring becomes. Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum through the harsh landscape of Sauron&rsquo;s country. On their way Gollum manages to split the two friends apart and at this time of their lives when they need each other the most, Frodo goes on, on his own. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The familiar characters are so deep in <i>The Return of the Kin</i>g and we follow them all through the test of their lifetime (even the long life of elves). One of the characters who develop the most is Samvise on Frodo and his journey, he becomes a true hero and in the dark hours he shows the movies main theme, that there is some good in the world and that it is worth fighting for. &nbsp;</p><p>Peter Jackson does not only a great job, but the greatest job picturing Tolkien&rsquo;s three books through all the big emotions and the most perfect fighting scenes so far.

Tolkien: The Lord of the Rings - A trilogy","Content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Tolkien trilogy in book form is more than 1000 pages. I guess that explains why this first of the three Rings trilogy is 170 minutes long! Three hours! But all is not lost in boredom. The story is relatively attention keeping though often dream-like. The scenery is breath taking. The computer aided choreography made this movie a masterpiece of its own and a tribute to technology. The blending of extremes of imagination with down to earth and believable emotions is masterful. The performers are obviously experienced and compatible with their parts. Such a combination of talents and skills to create an absorbable story is indeed an influence, which must be given diligent thought because this is another story of witchcraft, sorcery and wizardry. The luxury and enormity of this book-to-film is truly a challenger for your mind, \u003ci\u003eespecially\u003c/i\u003e the impressionable mind.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a middle-earth world, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) meets Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKlellan) as Gandalf travels to see Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) to find the 20th of 20 special rings: a ring that wants to be found. The 20 rings were created with special powers. One of the 20 rings, named \u0022My Precious\u0022 by Gollum, possessed the power to give the wearer power of global proportion. Bilbo Baggins is in possession of the one ring. To save the world, the ring must be destroyed but it cannot be destroyed except by the same fires that fashioned it, the fires of Mount Doom. So that is what Frodo, Gandalf and seven additional characters, the Fellowship of the Ring, set out to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the start of a trilogy that can only be described as incredible. From the first moment to the last you will be captivated by this magical and distant world of Elves, Dwarves, Men, Orcs, Goblins, Wizards and most importantly Hobbits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn undiscovered time in the history of a world foreign to ours is created. Even Elven languages can be heard and translated in this mystical environment. The scenery ranges from beautiful and inviting to desolate, but always keeps you absorbed in the air of the moment. From the Shire to Mordor Tolkien takes you on a quest that isn\u0027t easily forgotten. Nine members of the Fellowship are each about 3 or 4 feet high, yet played by normal sized actors. The monsters of J.R.R. Tolkien\u0027s imagination come to life in horrific and wonderful ways. This is a story of good vs. evil, with evil being all-powerful and good being generally 3 feet tall with hairy feet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf the three pieces of the Middle Earth puzzle, \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e is the one with the biggest handicap. It is afflicted with the \u0022middle chapter syndrome\u0022 \u0026ndash; an inherent obstacle for the second episode of any trilogy. \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e has no real beginning or end. It takes situations and characters introduced in \u003ci\u003eThe Fellowship of the Ring\u003c/i\u003e and prepares them for \u003ci\u003eThe Return of the King\u003c/i\u003e. The trick is to immerse audiences \u0022in the moment\u0022 and keep them from looking ahead. In nearly every way that counts, \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e is \u003ci\u003eThe Fellowship of the Ring\u003c/i\u003e\u0027s equal. In terms of tone, pacing, character development, plot advancement, and visual splendour, there is no drop-off. More importantly, the continuity is seamless, allowing a viewer familiar with the first movie to flow effortlessly into the second. Of course, therein lies a drawback, as well. \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e cannot stand on its own. Familiarity with \u003ci\u003eThe Fellowship of the Ring\u003c/i\u003e is not just advisable. It is mandatory. Anyone attempting to watch \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e without having seen (or read) the first instalment is headed for confusion.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe returning actors have grown nicely into their roles. There are changes, of course. Elijah Wood\u0027s Frodo is haunted and exhausted, relying more upon Sam. Wood\u0027s body language expresses the weight Frodo feels from bearing the ring. Viggo Mortensen\u0027s Aragon is a more heroic figure. Ian McKellan plays Gandalf with greater authority now that he has been transformed from a grey wizard to a white one. Newcomer Bernard Hill brings a sense of authority to Theoden. Miranda Otto is noble and strong as Eowyn. Brad Dourif is the slimy Grima Wormtongue, the servant of Sauruman who speaks poison into Theoden\u0027s ear. And, as Gollum, Andy Serkis (whose performance is overlaid with computer images) presents his twisted character as a strangely tragic and conflicted creature. We feel pity for Gollum.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e essentially picks up where \u003ci\u003eThe Fellowship of the Ring\u003c/i\u003e concludes, though following a short flashback to the battle between the wizard Gandalf and the Balrog. In the first movie, when Gandalf tumbles from the bridge, we see him disappear into the abyss. In the second movie, however, we follow him as he and the Balrog tumble endlessly downward, continuing their struggle along the way. In the wake of his victory over his enemy, Gandalf is reborn as a white wizard, and returns to the world above to re-unite with his former companions. In the company of Aragon, Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), the wizard heads for the city of Rohan, where he hopes to convince the king, Th\u0026eacute;oden (Bernard Hill), that war is upon his kingdom. At the same time, the hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), having escaped from their orc captors, flee into the forbidding Fanghorn Forest, where they come across Treebeard the Ent (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a giant shepherd of trees who decides to protect the two very small intruders. Meanwhile, to the East, Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) find themselves lost on their way to Mount Doom. And, in addition to suffering from the physical difficulties of such a difficult journey, Frodo is beginning to show the strain of bearing the ring, with the Dark Lord Sauron\u0027s threatening glare constantly seeking him. The creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), who has been following the hobbits, attempts to steal the ring from Frodo, but is captured. Thereafter, he reluctantly agrees to serve as Frodo and Sam\u0027s guide and take them to Mordor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stunning climax of \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e is the battle of Helm\u0027s Deep \u0026ndash; a 30-minute scene that features the blockade of a seemingly invincible stone fortress by an army of 10,000 creatures of Sauruman (Christopher Lee). Inside that fortress is a small force of several hundred humans and elves, led by Aragon, Theoden, Legolas, and Gimli. Although the attack occupies only a dozen pages of Tolkien\u0027s novel, Jackson has transformed it into the centrepiece of the film - an amazing, heart-stopping battle against impossible odds. Jackson has added dashes of amusement and romance to the film. Most of the humour, which is absolutely simple, involves Gimli, who occasionally seems to be around as much for comic relief as anything else. For example, in the middle of the battle of Helm\u0027s Deep, he is infuriated that his number of kills can\u0027t keep pace with Legolas\u0027. On the romantic front, Aragon, who is promised to the elven princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), finds himself the object of attention for Th\u0026eacute;oden\u0027s niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto). This sets up a triangle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e starts out a little slowly, but the rousing second half, which gathers energy like a rock racing downhill, will leave audiences craving more when the end credits roll. Combined, \u003ci\u003eThe Fellowship of the Ring\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e represent one of the most engrossing and engaging six-hour segments of cinema I have ever enjoyed. Like its forerunner, \u003ci\u003eThe Two Towers\u003c/i\u003e is a great motion picture, and not to be missed by anyone who appreciates fantasy adventure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u003c/i\u003e is the third movie from the trilogy\u003ci\u003e Lord of the Rings\u003c/i\u003e and the final battle of good and evil takes place in Middle-earth. All good beings are gathered to fight the dark lord Sauron. The dark creatures sent from Sauron attacks the forces of men at the once great kingdom, Gondor. \u0026nbsp;Now Gondor is led by Denethor (John Noble) the 26th Ruling Steward of Gondor, and the father of Farmir and Boromir.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoromir died in the first movie because he could not resist the power of the ring while joining the fellowship. The fellowship is no longer together, Frodo and Sam are trying to reach Mount Doom, Gandalf and Pippin are at Gondor to help the marsk defending all evil of Sauron. Rohan\u0026rsquo;s King Th\u0026eacute;oden and his army with Merry and Eowyn among them, rides to Gondor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLegolas and Gimli follow Aragorn through the path of death where Aragorn is to claim his heritage and become the King he was born to be. In every way Aragorn lives up to his title and with all the greatest skills a man can have, but can he really stand the evil of the dark lord. The movie flashes between the battle at Gondor and the quest of Frodo and Sam.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe closer Frodo gets to the fire of Mount Doom the heavier his burden, the Ring becomes. Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum through the harsh landscape of Sauron\u0026rsquo;s country. On their way Gollum manages to split the two friends apart and at this time of their lives when they need each other the most, Frodo goes on, on his own. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe familiar characters are so deep in \u003ci\u003eThe Return of the Kin\u003c/i\u003eg and we follow them all through the test of their lifetime (even the long life of elves). One of the characters who develop the most is Samvise on Frodo and his journey, he becomes a true hero and in the dark hours he shows the movies main theme, that there is some good in the world and that it is worth fighting for. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeter Jackson does not only a great job, but the greatest job picturing Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s three books through all the big emotions and the most perfect fighting scenes so far. I think that Peter Jackson has given movies a whole new limit and it will take long time to beat his fabulous creation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe final third of the puzzle is the equal of the first two, and this went down as one of the highest achievements of cinema.\u0026nbsp;Five out of five.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"J.R.R.
