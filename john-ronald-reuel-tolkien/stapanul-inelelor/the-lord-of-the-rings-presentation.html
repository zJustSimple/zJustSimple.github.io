All the hobbits are aware of Bilbo's wealthiness and their expectations to the big day are therefore extremely high. Especially due to the rumor telling that Bilbo had bought presents for everybody.</p><p>Bilbo himself has very high expectations, too. Not so much because of the party, but because of what he has planned to do. Longing to travel again, he has planned to make a disappearance in the middle of his birthday speech and thereafter as soon as possible leave the Shire.</p><p>In order to disappear Bilbo needs to make use of the ring, which he has kept safely in his hobbit hole, since he returned from the quest described in &ldquo;The Hobbit&rdquo;. When leaving Bilbo has then planned to pass the ring on to his nephew and heir &ldquo;Frodo Baggins&rdquo;. Saying goodbye to the one ring is far more difficult than expected, though. And if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Gandalf who saw through Bilbo and found him when he was about to leave &ndash; Bilbo and the ring would have left the Shire hand in hand.</p><p>This we hear about in the very first chapter and with Frodo inheriting the ring the story of &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; begins&hellip;</p><p>At the time of Bilbo&rsquo;s birthday party everything seemed peaceful in the <i>Middle Earth</i><a href="#_ftn1" title=""><i><strong>[1]</strong></i></a> and no one even dreamed of what was going to happen &ndash; but they were soon to find out!&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after Bilbo&rsquo;s disappearance the word goes around that the ring, Frodo had inherited is sought by the Dark Lord, Sauron. And if Sauron gets to possess the ring he will gain enough power to rule the entire Middle Earth.</p><p>Frodo is therefore forced to leave the Shire in order to keep the ring away from Sauron. Along with Frodo are his 2 very good friends Peregin Took, known as Pippin and Meriadoc Brandybuck, known as Merry. And furthermore Samwise Gamgee, who Gandalf caught listening, when he was telling Frodo what to do, accompanies them. Samwise is by Gandalf told to join Frodo on his journey as his right hand and is therefore &ndash; opposite Merry and Pippin &ndash; more or less forced to join the little party.</p><p>As they leave their homes in the Shire they don&rsquo;t even know exactly what&rsquo;s going on; but that the situation really is serious, becomes pretty obvious to them when they meet with some of Saurons Dark Knights and only in the last second manage to escape.</p><p>Where they&rsquo;re going they do not know either. On their way the party is increased by a mysterious stranger called Strider, who is a rugged, woodcrafty man, the most skilled huntsman of his day and also skilled at avoiding the traps of the enemy. He knows all of the lands for hundreds of miles and all of the peoples living in them. Gandalf tells him, the two of them are good friends, of Frodo&rsquo;s journey and is therefore waiting for the little party with the purpose of joining the hobbits.</p><p>The hobbits aren&rsquo;t aware of anything about this Strider, but anyway he manages to win their trust and without knowing, the hobbits get one of the most important and powerful characters of Middle Earth in their party. Because what Strider doesn&rsquo;t tell them is that his name is really Aragorn and he is the first heir to the throne of the reunited kingdom &ndash; a reunion, which will only take place, though, if Sauron can be defeated!&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-ko4qn" title="ID: heading-ko4qn" data-guid="0479f9dc-8e71-49ff-86cf-a8d0ce243531">The Council of Elrond</h2><p>The first stop on the hobbit&rsquo;s quest is Rivendale &ndash; the home of Elrond the Halfelven. Elrond is more than 2.000 years old and participated actively in the wars with Sauron many years ago. In fact he, and Aragorn's forefather Isildur were the ones, who back then captured the one ring from Sauron and thereby destroyed his body &ndash; not his soul. To make the world safe and make sure Sauron will never come back, the ring has to be destroyed, and the only way it can happen is by throwing it in into the Cracks of Doom where it was made. That Isildur couldn&rsquo;t do, when he had the chance. The power of the ring beat all the good in Isildur and he therefore kept the ring, and thereby caused that the threat of the Dark Lord was kept alive.</p><p>Elrond is considered the highest among "the good guys", and is therefore the one with the responsibility of finding a solution. At the council Elrond and representatives from all over the Middle Earth end up deciding that the ring must be brought to Mount Doom - the only place it can be destroyed. Frodo Baggins volunteers as ring bearer and another 8 people decides to join him - the names and a further description of the characters in this fellowship is to be find in the passage "Lord of the Rings - the characters".</p><h2 id="heading-941yc" title="ID: heading-941yc" data-guid="56fb63a3-af40-4ecc-ad10-af61d209a1e1">The story</h2><p>Considering the extent of the novel "Lord of the Rings", I have found it necessary to compromise on my presentation of the story. It's my opinion that if I hadn't chose a rather short presentation, I would have ended up with pages enough for 3 assignments. The summary of the story therefore might appear extremely short, and unsatisfactory, but it was this way or no way&hellip;</p><p>After the council of Elrond the fellowship leaves Rivendale. Before them awaits a journey longer and more dangerous than they can even imagine. They visit places no people have ever dared to visit before. They meet with all different kinds of creatures - both good and evil - and they are split up and gathered again several times.&nbsp;</p><p>Their quest seems impossible but anyway none of them ever loose faith, despite the fact that they suffer from starvation, several of them are wounded, and one of them are even killed. They know that the future of the world is depending on them and they don't want to fail&hellip;</p><p>Further details about the story I will in fact not reveal in this assignment - the story deserves to be read in it's original length and version - not only in small fragments!!! What I do want to reveal, though, is that the adventures they meet are so various and exciting that, one when reading the novel, sometimes feels like a member of the fellowship...</p><h2 id="heading-o417x" title="ID: heading-o417x" data-guid="a5c41ead-05de-4526-8f89-109989236653">Lord of the Rings &ndash; the characters</h2><p>Besides being a magnificent adventure with fantastic descriptions &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; contains a grandiose gallery of characters, described in a way that one almost get the feeling to know them.&nbsp;</p><p>I will in the following present some of the most important characters, of course focusing, more or less detailed, on the 9 characters in the fellowship of the ring&hellip;</p><h3 id="heading-9dk61" title="ID: heading-9dk61">Frodo Baggins</h3><p>Most important of them all is of course Frodo Baggins due to his role as &ldquo;ring bearer&rdquo;. Frodo possess no special abilities, no faculties or powers. He&rsquo;s an ordinary hobbit, who by coincidence suddenly holds the faith of the entire world in his hands. One wonders why all the great elves, wizards and warriors dare to leave their faith to this little creature, but one thing is certain. In order to accomplish the mission of destroying the ring, power, weapons or magic doesn&rsquo;t bring you far. What are needed are courage and an open heart and these qualities Frodo possess.&nbsp;</p><p>Frodo is the one chosen to save the world, but without the fellowship he could have done nothing. In the fellowship one might get the impression that Frodo is the &ldquo;little brother&rdquo; &ndash; despite that he&rsquo;s in fact the oldest of the 4 hobbits. Everyone in the fellowship are aware of the importance of taking care of Frodo and therefore Frodo in many situations appear helpless and one sometimes get the impression that Frodo perhaps wasn&rsquo;t the best choice as ring bearer. Whether he was or not is only to be find out by reading the novel&hellip;</p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to make a list of priority over the following 8 characters in the fellowship, so these I will present in random succession, starting, though, with my personal favourite, Sam Gamgee.</p><h3 id="heading-ttvry" title="ID: heading-ttvry">Samwise Gamgee</h3><p>As mentioned elsewhere in this assignment being a part of this great adventure wasn&rsquo;t something Sam Gamgee chose himself. Not in the first place anyway&hellip;It didn&rsquo;t take long for Sam, though, to develop a great deal of admiration of Mr. Frodo as he likes to refer to Frodo, so at the council of Elrond, Sam himself volunteered for the fellowship. All the way through the trilogy Sam never leaves Frodo&rsquo;s side, and in the end of the novel Sam must be said to play a very important part&hellip;Adjectives describing Sam Gamgee would be faithful, reliable, helpful, strong, brave and a very good friend.</p><h3 id="heading-wr9md" title="ID: heading-wr9md">Gandalf the Grey</h3><p>Gandalf the Grey&hellip; Not the most powerful among wizards, but perhaps among the <i>good</i> wizards and without a doubt the most powerful character in the fellowship, causing him to be considered the undisputed leader. He&rsquo;s the only one in the fellowship capable of practicing magic and is therefore often appearing as the fellowship&rsquo;s guardian angel. Gandalf the Grey is described elsewhere in this assignment<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><h3 id="heading-2md8x" title="ID: heading-2md8x">Aragorn</h3><p>Then there is of course Aragorn, or Strider, as the hobbits like to call him. Aragorn is described carefully in the passage &ldquo;<i>The Birthday of Bilbo Baggins</i>&rdquo; so here I will only try to define his role in the fellowship. Aragorn is what I will call &ldquo;second in command&rdquo; in the party. He cannot practice magic, but has shared so much time with the elves that he has inherited many of their special abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Gandalf the Grey isn&rsquo;t the kind of character you share your secrets with, so besides being second in command, Aragorn work as especially the hobbits confidential. He appears more human than Gandalf, which causes the hobbits to easier identify with him.</p><h3 id="heading-x5jyx" title="ID: heading-x5jyx">Legolas and Gimli</h3><p>Legolas of the elves people and Gimli the Dwarf participate in the whole novel, but they do not stamp the story in any way. Each of them carries different skills, which in many situations help the fellowship out of trouble. Legolas with his bow and Gimli with his ax demonstrate courage and great skill in fighting all through the 3 books. Traditionally the nature of elves and dwarves are incompatible but anyway the two of them manage to build up a great friendship during the story.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-fgqw6" title="ID: heading-fgqw6">Boromir</h3><p>Another character is Boromir, representing the humans, who like Legolas and Gimli mainly attends the fellowship because of his skills in fighting. Boromir is the only one who in the story distinctly seems to be affected by the ring&rsquo;s power, and is therefore appearing somewhat unreliable. Besides being affected by the ring Boromir seems to envy Aragorn for being heir to the reunited kingdom.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-myxgu" title="ID: heading-myxgu">Merry and Pippin</h3><p>Finally the fellowship consists of further two hobbits, Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck, respectively 21 and 13 years younger than Frodo. Both have they become a part of the 9 chosen ones by virtue of being best friends of Frodo. Often they only seem to be in the way and of no use or benefit for the fellowship, but separately they play an important part in the novel &ndash; in different parts of the story, though.</p><p>These are the 9 characters of the fellowship, but of course there are many other characters, which might deserve a place in this assignment.

All the hobbits are aware of Bilbo\u0027s wealthiness and their expectations to the big day are therefore extremely high. Especially due to the rumor telling that Bilbo had bought presents for everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBilbo himself has very high expectations, too. Not so much because of the party, but because of what he has planned to do. Longing to travel again, he has planned to make a disappearance in the middle of his birthday speech and thereafter as soon as possible leave the Shire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to disappear Bilbo needs to make use of the ring, which he has kept safely in his hobbit hole, since he returned from the quest described in \u0026ldquo;The Hobbit\u0026rdquo;. When leaving Bilbo has then planned to pass the ring on to his nephew and heir \u0026ldquo;Frodo Baggins\u0026rdquo;. Saying goodbye to the one ring is far more difficult than expected, though. And if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been for Gandalf who saw through Bilbo and found him when he was about to leave \u0026ndash; Bilbo and the ring would have left the Shire hand in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis we hear about in the very first chapter and with Frodo inheriting the ring the story of \u0026ldquo;Lord of the Rings\u0026rdquo; begins\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time of Bilbo\u0026rsquo;s birthday party everything seemed peaceful in the \u003ci\u003eMiddle Earth\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022#_ftn1\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[1]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and no one even dreamed of what was going to happen \u0026ndash; but they were soon to find out!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after Bilbo\u0026rsquo;s disappearance the word goes around that the ring, Frodo had inherited is sought by the Dark Lord, Sauron. And if Sauron gets to possess the ring he will gain enough power to rule the entire Middle Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrodo is therefore forced to leave the Shire in order to keep the ring away from Sauron. Along with Frodo are his 2 very good friends Peregin Took, known as Pippin and Meriadoc Brandybuck, known as Merry. And furthermore Samwise Gamgee, who Gandalf caught listening, when he was telling Frodo what to do, accompanies them. Samwise is by Gandalf told to join Frodo on his journey as his right hand and is therefore \u0026ndash; opposite Merry and Pippin \u0026ndash; more or less forced to join the little party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs they leave their homes in the Shire they don\u0026rsquo;t even know exactly what\u0026rsquo;s going on; but that the situation really is serious, becomes pretty obvious to them when they meet with some of Saurons Dark Knights and only in the last second manage to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere they\u0026rsquo;re going they do not know either. On their way the party is increased by a mysterious stranger called Strider, who is a rugged, woodcrafty man, the most skilled huntsman of his day and also skilled at avoiding the traps of the enemy. He knows all of the lands for hundreds of miles and all of the peoples living in them. Gandalf tells him, the two of them are good friends, of Frodo\u0026rsquo;s journey and is therefore waiting for the little party with the purpose of joining the hobbits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hobbits aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of anything about this Strider, but anyway he manages to win their trust and without knowing, the hobbits get one of the most important and powerful characters of Middle Earth in their party. Because what Strider doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell them is that his name is really Aragorn and he is the first heir to the throne of the reunited kingdom \u0026ndash; a reunion, which will only take place, though, if Sauron can be defeated!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ko4qn\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ko4qn\u0022 data-guid=\u00220479f9dc-8e71-49ff-86cf-a8d0ce243531\u0022\u003eThe Council of Elrond\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first stop on the hobbit\u0026rsquo;s quest is Rivendale \u0026ndash; the home of Elrond the Halfelven. Elrond is more than 2.000 years old and participated actively in the wars with Sauron many years ago. In fact he, and Aragorn\u0027s forefather Isildur were the ones, who back then captured the one ring from Sauron and thereby destroyed his body \u0026ndash; not his soul. To make the world safe and make sure Sauron will never come back, the ring has to be destroyed, and the only way it can happen is by throwing it in into the Cracks of Doom where it was made. That Isildur couldn\u0026rsquo;t do, when he had the chance. The power of the ring beat all the good in Isildur and he therefore kept the ring, and thereby caused that the threat of the Dark Lord was kept alive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElrond is considered the highest among \u0022the good guys\u0022, and is therefore the one with the responsibility of finding a solution. At the council Elrond and representatives from all over the Middle Earth end up deciding that the ring must be brought to Mount Doom - the only place it can be destroyed. Frodo Baggins volunteers as ring bearer and another 8 people decides to join him - the names and a further description of the characters in this fellowship is to be find in the passage \u0022Lord of the Rings - the characters\u0022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-941yc\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-941yc\u0022 data-guid=\u002256fb63a3-af40-4ecc-ad10-af61d209a1e1\u0022\u003eThe story\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsidering the extent of the novel \u0022Lord of the Rings\u0022, I have found it necessary to compromise on my presentation of the story. It\u0027s my opinion that if I hadn\u0027t chose a rather short presentation, I would have ended up with pages enough for 3 assignments. The summary of the story therefore might appear extremely short, and unsatisfactory, but it was this way or no way\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the council of Elrond the fellowship leaves Rivendale. Before them awaits a journey longer and more dangerous than they can even imagine. They visit places no people have ever dared to visit before. They meet with all different kinds of creatures - both good and evil - and they are split up and gathered again several times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir quest seems impossible but anyway none of them ever loose faith, despite the fact that they suffer from starvation, several of them are wounded, and one of them are even killed. They know that the future of the world is depending on them and they don\u0027t want to fail\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther details about the story I will in fact not reveal in this assignment - the story deserves to be read in it\u0027s original length and version - not only in small fragments!!! What I do want to reveal, though, is that the adventures they meet are so various and exciting that, one when reading the novel, sometimes feels like a member of the fellowship...\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-o417x\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-o417x\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a5c41ead-05de-4526-8f89-109989236653\u0022\u003eLord of the Rings \u0026ndash; the characters\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides being a magnificent adventure with fantastic descriptions \u0026ldquo;Lord of the Rings\u0026rdquo; contains a grandiose gallery of characters, described in a way that one almost get the feeling to know them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI will in the following present some of the most important characters, of course focusing, more or less detailed, on the 9 characters in the fellowship of the ring\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-9dk61\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-9dk61\u0022\u003eFrodo Baggins\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost important of them all is of course Frodo Baggins due to his role as \u0026ldquo;ring bearer\u0026rdquo;. Frodo possess no special abilities, no faculties or powers. He\u0026rsquo;s an ordinary hobbit, who by coincidence suddenly holds the faith of the entire world in his hands. One wonders why all the great elves, wizards and warriors dare to leave their faith to this little creature, but one thing is certain. In order to accomplish the mission of destroying the ring, power, weapons or magic doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring you far. What are needed are courage and an open heart and these qualities Frodo possess.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrodo is the one chosen to save the world, but without the fellowship he could have done nothing. In the fellowship one might get the impression that Frodo is the \u0026ldquo;little brother\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; despite that he\u0026rsquo;s in fact the oldest of the 4 hobbits. Everyone in the fellowship are aware of the importance of taking care of Frodo and therefore Frodo in many situations appear helpless and one sometimes get the impression that Frodo perhaps wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice as ring bearer. Whether he was or not is only to be find out by reading the novel\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to make a list of priority over the following 8 characters in the fellowship, so these I will present in random succession, starting, though, with my personal favourite, Sam Gamgee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-ttvry\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ttvry\u0022\u003eSamwise Gamgee\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned elsewhere in this assignment being a part of this great adventure wasn\u0026rsquo;t something Sam Gamgee chose himself. Not in the first place anyway\u0026hellip;It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for Sam, though, to develop a great deal of admiration of Mr. Frodo as he likes to refer to Frodo, so at the council of Elrond, Sam himself volunteered for the fellowship. All the way through the trilogy Sam never leaves Frodo\u0026rsquo;s side, and in the end of the novel Sam must be said to play a very important part\u0026hellip;Adjectives describing Sam Gamgee would be faithful, reliable, helpful, strong, brave and a very good friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-wr9md\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-wr9md\u0022\u003eGandalf the Grey\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGandalf the Grey\u0026hellip; Not the most powerful among wizards, but perhaps among the \u003ci\u003egood\u003c/i\u003e wizards and without a doubt the most powerful character in the fellowship, causing him to be considered the undisputed leader. He\u0026rsquo;s the only one in the fellowship capable of practicing magic and is therefore often appearing as the fellowship\u0026rsquo;s guardian angel. Gandalf the Grey is described elsewhere in this assignment\u003ca href=\u0022#_ftn2\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-2md8x\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-2md8x\u0022\u003eAragorn\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there is of course Aragorn, or Strider, as the hobbits like to call him. Aragorn is described carefully in the passage \u0026ldquo;\u003ci\u003eThe Birthday of Bilbo Baggins\u003c/i\u003e\u0026rdquo; so here I will only try to define his role in the fellowship. Aragorn is what I will call \u0026ldquo;second in command\u0026rdquo; in the party. He cannot practice magic, but has shared so much time with the elves that he has inherited many of their special abilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGandalf the Grey isn\u0026rsquo;t the kind of character you share your secrets with, so besides being second in command, Aragorn work as especially the hobbits confidential. He appears more human than Gandalf, which causes the hobbits to easier identify with him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-x5jyx\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-x5jyx\u0022\u003eLegolas and Gimli\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLegolas of the elves people and Gimli the Dwarf participate in the whole novel, but they do not stamp the story in any way. Each of them carries different skills, which in many situations help the fellowship out of trouble. Legolas with his bow and Gimli with his ax demonstrate courage and great skill in fighting all through the 3 books. Traditionally the nature of elves and dwarves are incompatible but anyway the two of them manage to build up a great friendship during the story.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-fgqw6\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-fgqw6\u0022\u003eBoromir\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother character is Boromir, representing the humans, who like Legolas and Gimli mainly attends the fellowship because of his skills in fighting. Boromir is the only one who in the story distinctly seems to be affected by the ring\u0026rsquo;s power, and is therefore appearing somewhat unreliable. Besides being affected by the ring Boromir seems to envy Aragorn for being heir to the reunited kingdom.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-myxgu\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-myxgu\u0022\u003eMerry and Pippin\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally the fellowship consists of further two hobbits, Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck, respectively 21 and 13 years younger than Frodo. Both have they become a part of the 9 chosen ones by virtue of being best friends of Frodo. Often they only seem to be in the way and of no use or benefit for the fellowship, but separately they play an important part in the novel \u0026ndash; in different parts of the story, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are the 9 characters of the fellowship, but of course there are many other characters, which might deserve a place in this assignment. In order to limit myself I will be contented with the characters already presented.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022#_ftnref1\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e The whole world, which the Shire is a little part of\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022#_ftnref2\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e Gandalf is described in the passage about the Hobbit\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The Lord of the Rings - Presentation","MetaDescription":"It’s time for the 111th birthday of Bilbo Baggins and the Shire is preparing the great feast.
