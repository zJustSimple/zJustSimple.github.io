Tolkien. The book was first published in 1937, by George Allen &amp; Unwin. It consists of 280 pages, nineteen chapters, with a few illustrations.</p><p><i>&ldquo;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worm an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat; it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bilbo is in his kitchen making tea, when suddenly thirteen dwarfs show up at his door. He welcomes them in, and serves them food and drinks. Their leader, Thorin Oakenshield, has a secret to reveal. He has brought with him a map over the Lonely Mountain, and the path to get through. Inside the mountain, a dangerous, red dragon, named Smaug, is guarding the great treasure. The cave used to belong to Thorin&rsquo;s ancestor, Thror, and Gandalf has given Thorin the special key which will open the secret entrance.</p><p>The reason why they show up at Bilbo&rsquo;s house is because they want him to join their quest. It was Gandalf who recommended Bilbo to Thorin; he described him as a useful burglar. Fortunately Bilbo joins them, and together with the rest of the party they plan for the next day. The following day, their adventure begins.</p><p>After a long walk, they decide to rest in the woods of Lonelands. Bilbo is searching for some firewood when he stumbles across some trolls. He notices that one of the trolls, named William, has a magic purse filled with money. Bilbo is trying out his skills as a burglar, but unfortunately the trolls notice that something is off. They discover Bilbo sneaking around and capture him. The trolls also find the rest of the party and capture them to. By hiding in the bushes, and confusing the trolls by imitating their voices, Gandalf saves the day. They are fighting and arguing until the break of dawn, and suddenly the trolls are turned into stone. Bilbo discovers a secret cave, the home of the trolls. Inside they find weapons, swords and gold. Thorin claims a sword named Orcrist, Gandalf a sword he calls Glamdring and Bilbo a sword he calls Stinger.</p><p>After a while, Bilbo and the party arrive at Rivendell, the home of the elves. It is also called The Last Homely House of the West. Eldron, the leader of the elves, reads some moon-letters (letters which can only be seen in the proper moonlight), which reveals where the secret entrance is. They stay at Rivendell for fourteen days, before they leave for the Misty Mountains.</p><p>Heading towards the Misty Mountains, the party experiences some bad weather, and two of the dwarfs go searching for shelter. Bilbo wakes up in the middle of the night, by a rock wall which is cracking up. Lots of goblins flow out of the hole, and Bilbo panics. Gandalf tries to help them, but in all the mess Bilbo disappears from the company, and is left behind in an unknown tunnel.</p><p>Bilbo wakes up, and everything is pitch black. He knows evil forces are near, because Stinger glows in the presence of orcs. In this dark, scary tunnel Bilbo finds an item and puts it in his pocket. He also meets Gollum, a nasty, slimy creature, who has lived by an underground lake most of his life and now he is hungry. He tries to eat Bilbo, but instead they make a deal; if Bilbo can give him the right answer on some riddles, Gollum will show him the way out. If not, Gollum can eat him. On the last riddle, Gollum is not able to give Bilbo the right answer, and runs after him. Bilbo grabs the unknown object in his pocket, and realizes it is a ring. The ring is in imbued with magic and as it slips on to his finger, Bilbo turns invisible, and he is able to escape the tunnels.</p><p>After a while, Bilbo locates the rest of the company. But more trouble is close at hand. They stumble across some wargs (huge and evil wolves) and goblins. They try to kill Bilbo and his friends. Fortunately Gandalf shoots fire at their foes. Giant eagles save Bilbo and his companions, and bring them to Carrock, a large hill.</p><p>After the assistance from the eagles, the party is heading towards Beorn&rsquo;s house, in the middle of a forest. Beorn does not like strangers, so they approach him in smaller groups. Beorn was a huge man who could turn into a bear&rsquo;s shape. Bilbo is given some advices about Mirkwood, and what kind of dangers they may come across. At the edge of Mirkwood, Gandalf leaves them.</p><p>Finallythey enter the woods. It has been a dark and dangerous forest for many centuries. At their journey through the forest, Bombur falls into the magic river and falls asleep. He also dreams that some woodelves are having a party in the woods, which turns out to be true. Thorin is unlucky and gets caught by the elves while he is exploring the chance to get some food and aid from them. The rest of the party, except from Bilbo, is captured by giant spiders. He uses his ring, and manages to escape. The dwarfs are taken to the woodelves palace and the leader of the elves would not let them go before they had told him what their businesses were. Bilbo manages to steal the keys, and release the dwarfs.</p><p>After a long walk, Bilbo and his friends arrive at Lake-Town. Everybody is cold and starving. Thorin tells everybody in Lake-Town that the King Under the Mountain has returned, and everybody is happy and satisfied. But the Master of Lake-Town refuses to let Thorin take control over the town. He gives them horses and supplies to help Thorin and his companions to reach their goal, with the secret desire that the dragon will kill them.</p><p>The party finally arrive at the Lonely Mountain (the proper name is Erebor). Kili, Fili and Bilbo search for the secret door, and luckily for them, they find it.</p><p>Thorin uses his key to open the door. The door is three feet wide and five feet high. Behind it a black tunnel leads down into the mountain. A long time ago, there was a town at the foot of the mountain, called Dale.</p><p>Inside the mountain, Bilbo finds a two-handled cup, which he steals. This makes the dragon Smaug beside himself with anger, and he kills the company&rsquo;s ponies. Bilbo is invisible and walks towards Smaug. Smaug notices him because of the smell. Bilbo talks to Smaug, and they exchange riddles.</p><p>Smaug thinks that Bilbo comes from the Lake-Town, and flies toward the town, smashing the mountainside where the secret door is.</p><p>While Smaug is flying towards the Lake-Town, the rest of the company take the opportunity to explore the cave. Bilbo finds a valuable stone, named Arkenstone. According to Thorin, it is the most valuable object in the entire mountain. Thorin gives Bilbo armour made of Mithril, a very special silvery-steel material.</p><p>Smaug attacks Esgaroth (Lake-Town) in rage. A trush (a bird), tells the warrior named Bard, about a bare patch on Smaug&rsquo;s breast, not covered by his impervious shell. Bard kills Smaug by shooting him in the bare patch with an arrow. After Smaug&rsquo;s death, the armies of Esgaroth and the Woodelves showes up at the Lonely Mountains to share the treasure between them, but Thorin refuses.</p><p>Bilbo wants the problems between Thorin and the Woodelves solved, so he uses his ring and places the Arkenstone in Bard&rsquo;s pocket. Then Gandalfs shows up, and congratulates Bilbo for his actions.</p><p>The next day, Gandalf and the leader of the Woodelves use the Arkenstone to bargain with Thorin. He promises to share the treasure, but tells Bilbo to go away and never return.</p><p>Many people had died because of the war between Dain and the goblins. Bilbo finds Thorin, almost dead. The got the opportunity to forgive each other, and still be friends. Bilbo finds a chest of silver and gold, and leaves his friends. Gandalf joins him on the way home, together with Beorn.</p><p>They arrive at Rivendell and from there Bilbo heads home. Bilbo later writes a book of his memories, named There and Back Again, A Hobbit&rsquo;s Holliday. This is the book J.R.R. Tolkien has translated and called The Hobbit.</p><h2 id="heading-2lgj6" data-guid="e7d439fc-e2f1-4969-8b3d-1e7af027d497">Characters</h2><p><strong>Bilbo Baggins</strong>: The Hobbit which showed the way to the Lonely Mountain, to reclaim the treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. Bilbo also found the ring in Gollum&rsquo;s cave. Baggins is very low, about the half size of a human, actually smaller than dwarfs. He also got a huge stomach, and wears a dress in bright colors. Nobody of the hobbit use shoes, because their feet are like leather soles. He is almost like a little child, with hair on his legs and curly hair. He also has long, brown fingers, a good-natured face and he has a weakness for food.</p><p><strong>Gandalf</strong>: The wise Wizard, which always helps Bilbo in dangerous situations. He is well-known for his magic powers. He is a tall old man, with long grey beard. He enjoys blowing smoke rings. Gandalf and Bilbo are very good friends, something we get the opportunity to read about in this book.</p><p><strong>Thorin Oakenshield</strong>: Son of the King of Dwarves. When Smaug died, he became the King under the Mountain, thought he was killed in combat in the battle of five Armies. He is also a very low person, with beard and he wears a hood.</p><p><strong>Smaug</strong>: The dragon of the Lonely Mountains, who guards the treasure. He is a very dangerous creature, and is golden red. He also has a good sense of smell.</p><p><strong>Gollum</strong>: A nasty, slimy creature which lives in an underground lake. In the beginning, Gollum was just like a hobbit, but he was possessed by the ring, so it turned him into an evil creature</p><p><strong>Bard</strong>: The warrior who killed Smaug. They later considered him as a hero, but they didn&rsquo;t know it was Bilbo who discovered the weak spot in the beginning.</p><p><strong>Beorn</strong>: An enemy of the goblins. In the beginning he becomes friends with Bilbo and Gandalf. He has the ability to change forms from human to bear.</p><p>John Tolkien has managed to describe the characters in such a good way, that there is no problem to get confused. You will always know who it is! We don&rsquo;t have to guess what the characters think or how they look like, because the author has a very convincing way of writing.</p><p>None of the characters is &ldquo;changing personality&rdquo; during the story. Some of the people are involved on the evil side, and some at the good side.</p><h2 id="heading-vxt2p" data-guid="579bcf00-cc2a-491d-b4da-12712a62b6a7">Setting</h2><p>The setting is not dated, but as a reader, we get the impression that this happened a long time ago. One example is the weapons the characters uses; In these modern times, people use rifles and guns for weapons, but in this book, they use swords, bows and arrows and daggers.</p><p>The environment in the book is clearly not from this world, but more from a fictive world, like a fantasy world. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien has created a brand new world with items and creatures and landscape that don&rsquo;t exist in our world (actually never existed!). Scary creatures like goblins, wargs and dragons, and rings that make you invisible are examples of this.</p><p>I think that the setting is an element that is important to the conflict in the book. The terrain around was rough some places, but in Bag-End there where flowers, and other things who create a lovely atmosphere. The distance to other places was very long, and a lot of the surroundings were dangerous; the dragon in the Lonely Mountain, the spiders and Woodelves in Mirkwood, Gollum in the secret, hidden cave and the goblins.</p><p>Not only is the setting an important element to the story, and the conflict, but also the behavior of the characters in this environment. They are clearly affected to this setting, and where/when the story takes place. Lot of the story takes place in the Lonely Mountain.</p><h2 id="heading-yo8d6" data-guid="839b4671-ca0b-43aa-aac4-b4a9d7a5c50e">Opinion&nbsp;</h2><p>I really enjoyed reading this book, especially the character Gollum. I just love when he says &ldquo;my precious&rdquo; to himself. I also liked how the book kept my attention the whole way through the story; it&rsquo;s almost &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; when you read it.</p><p>I also liked the dialog between the characters; it wasn&rsquo;t just chitchat, but interesting. One example is the dialog between Bilbo and Gollum, the riddle-contest. That was also my favourite part in the whole book. I also liked the way John Tolkien describe all kinds of different situations. He has described the environment in the book so well, that you actually can feel that you are a part of the adventure; you are your own character.</p><p>He has also written his books with a language everybody understands. He doesn&rsquo;t use different and over-formal words in his text, which is very positive!

Tolkien. The book was first published in 1937, by George Allen \u0026amp; Unwin. It consists of 280 pages, nineteen chapters, with a few illustrations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0026ldquo;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worm an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat; it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBilbo is in his kitchen making tea, when suddenly thirteen dwarfs show up at his door. He welcomes them in, and serves them food and drinks. Their leader, Thorin Oakenshield, has a secret to reveal. He has brought with him a map over the Lonely Mountain, and the path to get through. Inside the mountain, a dangerous, red dragon, named Smaug, is guarding the great treasure. The cave used to belong to Thorin\u0026rsquo;s ancestor, Thror, and Gandalf has given Thorin the special key which will open the secret entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason why they show up at Bilbo\u0026rsquo;s house is because they want him to join their quest. It was Gandalf who recommended Bilbo to Thorin; he described him as a useful burglar. Fortunately Bilbo joins them, and together with the rest of the party they plan for the next day. The following day, their adventure begins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a long walk, they decide to rest in the woods of Lonelands. Bilbo is searching for some firewood when he stumbles across some trolls. He notices that one of the trolls, named William, has a magic purse filled with money. Bilbo is trying out his skills as a burglar, but unfortunately the trolls notice that something is off. They discover Bilbo sneaking around and capture him. The trolls also find the rest of the party and capture them to. By hiding in the bushes, and confusing the trolls by imitating their voices, Gandalf saves the day. They are fighting and arguing until the break of dawn, and suddenly the trolls are turned into stone. Bilbo discovers a secret cave, the home of the trolls. Inside they find weapons, swords and gold. Thorin claims a sword named Orcrist, Gandalf a sword he calls Glamdring and Bilbo a sword he calls Stinger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, Bilbo and the party arrive at Rivendell, the home of the elves. It is also called The Last Homely House of the West. Eldron, the leader of the elves, reads some moon-letters (letters which can only be seen in the proper moonlight), which reveals where the secret entrance is. They stay at Rivendell for fourteen days, before they leave for the Misty Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeading towards the Misty Mountains, the party experiences some bad weather, and two of the dwarfs go searching for shelter. Bilbo wakes up in the middle of the night, by a rock wall which is cracking up. Lots of goblins flow out of the hole, and Bilbo panics. Gandalf tries to help them, but in all the mess Bilbo disappears from the company, and is left behind in an unknown tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBilbo wakes up, and everything is pitch black. He knows evil forces are near, because Stinger glows in the presence of orcs. In this dark, scary tunnel Bilbo finds an item and puts it in his pocket. He also meets Gollum, a nasty, slimy creature, who has lived by an underground lake most of his life and now he is hungry. He tries to eat Bilbo, but instead they make a deal; if Bilbo can give him the right answer on some riddles, Gollum will show him the way out. If not, Gollum can eat him. On the last riddle, Gollum is not able to give Bilbo the right answer, and runs after him. Bilbo grabs the unknown object in his pocket, and realizes it is a ring. The ring is in imbued with magic and as it slips on to his finger, Bilbo turns invisible, and he is able to escape the tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, Bilbo locates the rest of the company. But more trouble is close at hand. They stumble across some wargs (huge and evil wolves) and goblins. They try to kill Bilbo and his friends. Fortunately Gandalf shoots fire at their foes. Giant eagles save Bilbo and his companions, and bring them to Carrock, a large hill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the assistance from the eagles, the party is heading towards Beorn\u0026rsquo;s house, in the middle of a forest. Beorn does not like strangers, so they approach him in smaller groups. Beorn was a huge man who could turn into a bear\u0026rsquo;s shape. Bilbo is given some advices about Mirkwood, and what kind of dangers they may come across. At the edge of Mirkwood, Gandalf leaves them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinallythey enter the woods. It has been a dark and dangerous forest for many centuries. At their journey through the forest, Bombur falls into the magic river and falls asleep. He also dreams that some woodelves are having a party in the woods, which turns out to be true. Thorin is unlucky and gets caught by the elves while he is exploring the chance to get some food and aid from them. The rest of the party, except from Bilbo, is captured by giant spiders. He uses his ring, and manages to escape. The dwarfs are taken to the woodelves palace and the leader of the elves would not let them go before they had told him what their businesses were. Bilbo manages to steal the keys, and release the dwarfs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a long walk, Bilbo and his friends arrive at Lake-Town. Everybody is cold and starving. Thorin tells everybody in Lake-Town that the King Under the Mountain has returned, and everybody is happy and satisfied. But the Master of Lake-Town refuses to let Thorin take control over the town. He gives them horses and supplies to help Thorin and his companions to reach their goal, with the secret desire that the dragon will kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe party finally arrive at the Lonely Mountain (the proper name is Erebor). Kili, Fili and Bilbo search for the secret door, and luckily for them, they find it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThorin uses his key to open the door. The door is three feet wide and five feet high. Behind it a black tunnel leads down into the mountain. A long time ago, there was a town at the foot of the mountain, called Dale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInside the mountain, Bilbo finds a two-handled cup, which he steals. This makes the dragon Smaug beside himself with anger, and he kills the company\u0026rsquo;s ponies. Bilbo is invisible and walks towards Smaug. Smaug notices him because of the smell. Bilbo talks to Smaug, and they exchange riddles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmaug thinks that Bilbo comes from the Lake-Town, and flies toward the town, smashing the mountainside where the secret door is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Smaug is flying towards the Lake-Town, the rest of the company take the opportunity to explore the cave. Bilbo finds a valuable stone, named Arkenstone. According to Thorin, it is the most valuable object in the entire mountain. Thorin gives Bilbo armour made of Mithril, a very special silvery-steel material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmaug attacks Esgaroth (Lake-Town) in rage. A trush (a bird), tells the warrior named Bard, about a bare patch on Smaug\u0026rsquo;s breast, not covered by his impervious shell. Bard kills Smaug by shooting him in the bare patch with an arrow. After Smaug\u0026rsquo;s death, the armies of Esgaroth and the Woodelves showes up at the Lonely Mountains to share the treasure between them, but Thorin refuses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBilbo wants the problems between Thorin and the Woodelves solved, so he uses his ring and places the Arkenstone in Bard\u0026rsquo;s pocket. Then Gandalfs shows up, and congratulates Bilbo for his actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Gandalf and the leader of the Woodelves use the Arkenstone to bargain with Thorin. He promises to share the treasure, but tells Bilbo to go away and never return.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people had died because of the war between Dain and the goblins. Bilbo finds Thorin, almost dead. The got the opportunity to forgive each other, and still be friends. Bilbo finds a chest of silver and gold, and leaves his friends. Gandalf joins him on the way home, together with Beorn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey arrive at Rivendell and from there Bilbo heads home. Bilbo later writes a book of his memories, named There and Back Again, A Hobbit\u0026rsquo;s Holliday. This is the book J.R.R. Tolkien has translated and called The Hobbit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2lgj6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e7d439fc-e2f1-4969-8b3d-1e7af027d497\u0022\u003eCharacters\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBilbo Baggins\u003c/strong\u003e: The Hobbit which showed the way to the Lonely Mountain, to reclaim the treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. Bilbo also found the ring in Gollum\u0026rsquo;s cave. Baggins is very low, about the half size of a human, actually smaller than dwarfs. He also got a huge stomach, and wears a dress in bright colors. Nobody of the hobbit use shoes, because their feet are like leather soles. He is almost like a little child, with hair on his legs and curly hair. He also has long, brown fingers, a good-natured face and he has a weakness for food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGandalf\u003c/strong\u003e: The wise Wizard, which always helps Bilbo in dangerous situations. He is well-known for his magic powers. He is a tall old man, with long grey beard. He enjoys blowing smoke rings. Gandalf and Bilbo are very good friends, something we get the opportunity to read about in this book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThorin Oakenshield\u003c/strong\u003e: Son of the King of Dwarves. When Smaug died, he became the King under the Mountain, thought he was killed in combat in the battle of five Armies. He is also a very low person, with beard and he wears a hood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmaug\u003c/strong\u003e: The dragon of the Lonely Mountains, who guards the treasure. He is a very dangerous creature, and is golden red. He also has a good sense of smell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGollum\u003c/strong\u003e: A nasty, slimy creature which lives in an underground lake. In the beginning, Gollum was just like a hobbit, but he was possessed by the ring, so it turned him into an evil creature\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBard\u003c/strong\u003e: The warrior who killed Smaug. They later considered him as a hero, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t know it was Bilbo who discovered the weak spot in the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeorn\u003c/strong\u003e: An enemy of the goblins. In the beginning he becomes friends with Bilbo and Gandalf. He has the ability to change forms from human to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohn Tolkien has managed to describe the characters in such a good way, that there is no problem to get confused. You will always know who it is! We don\u0026rsquo;t have to guess what the characters think or how they look like, because the author has a very convincing way of writing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of the characters is \u0026ldquo;changing personality\u0026rdquo; during the story. Some of the people are involved on the evil side, and some at the good side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-vxt2p\u0022 data-guid=\u0022579bcf00-cc2a-491d-b4da-12712a62b6a7\u0022\u003eSetting\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe setting is not dated, but as a reader, we get the impression that this happened a long time ago. One example is the weapons the characters uses; In these modern times, people use rifles and guns for weapons, but in this book, they use swords, bows and arrows and daggers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe environment in the book is clearly not from this world, but more from a fictive world, like a fantasy world. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien has created a brand new world with items and creatures and landscape that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in our world (actually never existed!). Scary creatures like goblins, wargs and dragons, and rings that make you invisible are examples of this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that the setting is an element that is important to the conflict in the book. The terrain around was rough some places, but in Bag-End there where flowers, and other things who create a lovely atmosphere. The distance to other places was very long, and a lot of the surroundings were dangerous; the dragon in the Lonely Mountain, the spiders and Woodelves in Mirkwood, Gollum in the secret, hidden cave and the goblins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only is the setting an important element to the story, and the conflict, but also the behavior of the characters in this environment. They are clearly affected to this setting, and where/when the story takes place. Lot of the story takes place in the Lonely Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-yo8d6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022839b4671-ca0b-43aa-aac4-b4a9d7a5c50e\u0022\u003eOpinion\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI really enjoyed reading this book, especially the character Gollum. I just love when he says \u0026ldquo;my precious\u0026rdquo; to himself. I also liked how the book kept my attention the whole way through the story; it\u0026rsquo;s almost \u0026ldquo;flowing\u0026rdquo; when you read it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also liked the dialog between the characters; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just chitchat, but interesting. One example is the dialog between Bilbo and Gollum, the riddle-contest. That was also my favourite part in the whole book. I also liked the way John Tolkien describe all kinds of different situations. He has described the environment in the book so well, that you actually can feel that you are a part of the adventure; you are your own character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe has also written his books with a language everybody understands. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t use different and over-formal words in his text, which is very positive! This also means that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to understand English like a professional, almost everybody can read it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is absolutely a book I would recommend for everybody, especially teenagers and maybe grown-ups who love fantasy and fiction.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The Hobbit | Book review","MetaDescription":"The Hobbit – Or There and Back again is a fantasy novel by J.R.R.
