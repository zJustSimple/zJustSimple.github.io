We will also look at a few of the&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color:black;">human characters</span></strong><span style="color:black;">, such as Mr. Jones, Mr. Frederick and Mr. Pilkington, and discuss the roles they play in the story.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Note that Animal Farm is a fable that works as a&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color:black;">political allegory</span></strong><span style="color:black;">. This means that most of the characters - individual as well as collective - are meant to symbolize specific people or groups of people from real life.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">You can read more about what or whom each character is meant to symbolise in&nbsp;</span><a target="_top" title="the Allegory section" href="https://liceunet.ro/animal-farm/interpretation/allegory"><span style="color:#0075e3;">the Allegory section</span></a><span style="color:black;">.</span></p><h2 id="heading-1" data-guid="f31da8a9-a679-479f-a8c5-746085fb3bf6">Napoleon</h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Napoleon is the&nbsp;<strong>main character</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color:#1a242e;">Animal Farm</span></em><span style="color:#1a242e;">, as he is the driving force behind most of the plot. However, we generally do not have direct access to his perspective, but mostly learn of his actions and plans from the point of view of the other animals. This echoes the way in which Napoleon carries out most of his plans in secret and removes himself from the daily lives of the animals to become a figurehead.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He is a pig, described as a &ldquo;rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar&rdquo; (p. 9). His physical appearance changes at several points in the story &ndash; for example, he gradually grows fatter as he reserves more and more food for himself, and he starts to wear human clothes.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">His appearance also changes dramatically in the story&rsquo;s climax, when he beings to walk on his hind legs like a human being: &ldquo;&hellip;Napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side [&hellip;] He carried a whip in his trotter.&rdquo; (p. 89).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">As pigs are considered the most intelligent animals (p.9), Napoleon quickly rises to a position of power even before the Rebellion, when he develops the principles of Animalism along with Snowball and Squealer (pp. 9-10).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">When the animals have taken over, we quickly get the impression that Napoleon is&nbsp;<strong>greedy</strong>. After the cows have been milked, he suspiciously stays behind - and we later learn it was to make sure that the milk went to the pigs. Throughout the story we see similar efforts to seize more resources for himself and his upper class of pigs, such as his takeover of the farmhouse with its modern conveniences and his schemes to obtain apples and alcohol. The most dramatic expression of his greed is when he sacrifices Boxer&rsquo;s life to purchase a crate of whisky towards the end of the story (pp. 81-84).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Napoleon&rsquo;s greed does not stop at resources, as he is also&nbsp;<strong>hungry for power</strong>. As the story progresses, we witness his gradual takeover of Animal Farm. At first, he is Snowball&rsquo;s political rival and the two of them compete for control. However, the hostile takeover at the windmill meeting leaves Napoleon alone in a position of power. He takes advantage of this position to end the tradition of political debates and voting, putting all power in the hands of a special committee of pigs (p. 36).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Towards the end of the story, Napoleon increasingly resembles&nbsp;<strong>a dictator</strong>. He lives in isolation and only shows himself when surrounded by his guard dogs. He even forms a cult of personality around himself, ensuring that all the animals become completely devoted to him and with the help of Squealer he spreads propaganda that greatly exaggerates his abilities (pp. 62-63). He also awards himself military medals (pp. 55, 72) to further strengthen the image of himself as a heroic leader, devoted to his people. It is also implied that he has relationships with a number of different female pigs, as a suspicious number of the new generation of pigs have some of his features. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">His actions during the story reveal that Napoleon is both cunning and ruthless.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He is&nbsp;<strong>cunning</strong>&nbsp;because he carefully plans his takeover, seeing an opportunity in the young puppies that he personally trains to become devoted guard dogs. He also cleverly holds on to his power by creating various more-or-less real outside threats that he can protect his people from, most importantly his repeated accusations that Snowball is still somehow trying to infiltrate and destroy the farm even after he is long gone:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&rsquo;Comrades [&hellip;] do you know who is responsible for this? Do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill? SNOWBALL! [&hellip;] Snowball has done this thing! In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year...&nbsp;(p. 47)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He also cleverly manipulates the animals&rsquo; opinions with all the tools at his disposal, using Squealer to create the propaganda that influences them and alter the Commandments to suit him, the simple-minded sheep to repeat his core messages and the vicious dogs to threaten anyone who starts questioning him.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">His manipulation also extends to human beings, as he is able to form successful business relations with them, and at one point even succeeds in deceiving them about the near-starvation occurring at the farm (p. 50).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">He is&nbsp;<strong>ruthless</strong>&nbsp;because he is willing to employ violent and gruesome methods to strengthen his power. This is most clearly seen in his brutal round of executions, where &lsquo;traitors&rsquo; step forward to deliver confessions - which are implied to be fabricated by Napoleon himself. His betrayal of Boxer is also a particularly dark event, as Boxer devoted to Napoleon and gives everything to work for the improvement of Animal Farm, but Napoleon is still willing to sacrifice him as soon as becomes useless, as he sees the opportunity to make a bit of money.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">His ruthlessness is also seen in his relationship towards Snowball, as he at first mocks him for his plans without providing any alternatives (p. 32), and then even proceeds to show his disrespect by urinating on his designs for the windwill (p. 33).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Though Napoleon is almost entirely characterised in negative terms, we do get a small indication of his&nbsp;<strong>bravery</strong>&nbsp;at one point, as he is the only animal who does not react in fear when the windmill is blown up by Frederick&rsquo;s men: &ldquo;...all the animals, except Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces&rdquo; (p. 69).</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="a72c66af-09a3-4592-9a22-6961cc206115">Snowball</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Snowball is Napoleon's political rival in the first half of the story.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He is a pig, described as &ldquo;...a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive&hellip;&rdquo; (p. 9). He creates the political philosophy of Animalism along with Squealer and Napoleon and plays a significant role in the early period of Animal Farm.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Unlike Napoleon, Snowball seems&nbsp;<strong>eager to improve the lives and minds of the other animals on the farm</strong>. He organises a number of ambitious projects, such as the attempts to teach the animals to read and write (p. 20). He also earnestly wants them to understand the principles of Animalism, so they are aware of the important Rebellion they are to take part in. We see this in his early discussion with Mollie: &ldquo; &lsquo;Comrade,&rsquo; said Snowball, &lsquo;those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 10).</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">His ambition on the animals&rsquo; behalf can also be seen in his plans for the windmill, since he genuinely seems to believe that it will improve the living conditions of all the animals:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">&hellip;fantastic machines that would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation. [&hellip;] &hellip; so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week. (p. 33)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Snowball is a&nbsp;<strong>clever military strategist</strong>, as he is responsible for successfully defeating Mr. Jones&rsquo; assault force (pp. 26-27). He also directly participates in the battle, becoming a war hero as he is wounded in the process. However, the battle scene also shows a&nbsp;<strong>ruthless and brutal</strong>&nbsp;side to Snowball, as is revealed in his comment to Boxer about the stable boy they believe Boxer has killed: &ldquo; &lsquo;No sentimentality, comrade!&rsquo; cried Snowball, from whose wounds the blood was still dripping. &lsquo;War is war. The only good human being is a dead one.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 28).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Snowball is&nbsp;<strong>unusually intelligent and well-read</strong>, even compared to the other pigs. He launches a number of clever plan and innovations to make the farm more efficient:</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He talked learnedly about field-drains, silage and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage.&nbsp;(p. 32)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">As mentioned, he is also responsible for the design of the windmill and he draws up detailed graphs and diagrams to show how it is going to work (pp. 32-33). He is also a talented political speaker, as he seems to have convinced the animals that his windmill plan is going to work, before his efforts are spoiled by Napoleon&rsquo;s attack (pp. 34-35). However, despite his cleverness he does not necessarily have all the answers himself: &ldquo;How [the materials for the windmill] were to be procured Snowball did not say.&rdquo; (p. 33).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even after Snowball has escaped, he still plays a role in the story, as he becomes a&nbsp;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&nbsp;for all the bad things that happen on Animal Farm later on.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Although Snowball generally appears to be more sympathetic than Napoleon, it is important to note that he also takes part in the pigs&rsquo; early efforts to secure more resources for themselves and take more political control of the farm. For example, he is in full agreement with the arrangement that reserves milk and apples for the pigs (p. 23). Along with his brutal attitude to humanity noted above, this serves to make him less sympathetic in the eyes of the reader - even though he still presented as&nbsp;<strong>a preferable leader</strong>&nbsp;to Napoleon. However, the story suggests that none of the pigs would have been an ideal leader.&nbsp;</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="1510dc4f-663d-4b21-93eb-d0c5e58d58b9">Squealer</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Squealer is part of the trio of pigs who create the principles of Animalism, along with Napoleon and Snowball.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He is described as a &ldquo;small fat pig [...] with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements and a shrill voice&rdquo; (p. 9). We are also repeatedly told that is a brilliant talker, able to convince anyone of anything, as he can even &ldquo;...turn black into white&rdquo; (p. 9). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Throughout the story, Squealer plays the role of the pigs&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong>mouthpiece</strong>(especially Napoleon&rsquo;s). Whenever the pigs do something that may be regarded as unfair or controversial, Squealer makes his rounds on the farm and tells various stories designed to convince the animals that the new rule is simply for the best for everyone.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Later on, he also starts to&nbsp;<strong>manipulate the animals</strong>, changing their memories of events that have previously happened, telling new stories that eventually become accepted as truth. A clear example of this is his repeated efforts to re-brand&nbsp;the war hero Snowball as a cunning criminal in league with the humans:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. [&hellip;] Do you not remember how, just at the moment when Jones and his men had got inside the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him? (p. 54)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Squealer&rsquo;s manipulations of the truth are not limited to speeches alone, as we eventually learn that he is the one who has been&nbsp;<strong>altering the Commandments</strong>&nbsp;at night to fit Napoleon&rsquo;s new policies: &ldquo;At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces. Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paintbrush and an overturned pot of white paint.&rdquo; (p. 73).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Squealer is completely<strong>&nbsp;loyal to Napoleon</strong>&nbsp;throughout the novel, repeating his words and making all kinds of efforts to strengthen his rule. However, we also get clear indications that Squealer personally benefits from the pigs&rsquo; control of power and resources, especially in the final chapter: &ldquo;Squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes&rdquo; (p. 85).</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="8e70fe41-9c58-4ee1-b3b9-ca3651fbe857">Boxer</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Boxer is a workhorse at the farm, whose labour plays a significant role in its development. He is introduced as &ldquo;...an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together.&rdquo; (p. 2).</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:black;">Boxer is a workhorse in both the literal and figurative sense.</span></strong><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;He is very excited about the new freedom the animals enjoy and he works incredibly hard for everyone&rsquo;s benefit. He even adopts&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;I will work harder!&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;as a personal motto and response to any problem that presents itself. He gets up earlier than everyone else in the morning, just to put in a bit of extra volunteer work on top of his normal duties (p. 18). He is single-handedly responsible for making many of the ambitious plans on the farm possible - for instance, it is noted that the first windmill project could not have worked without him (p. 41).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">He is not characterised as very intelligent at first, as he struggles with learning more than four letters of the alphabet (p. 21) and generally seems eager to accept the propaganda delivered by the pigs, especially Napoleon. After Napoleon&rsquo;s takeover, Boxer accepts the new explanation of events and adopts&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Napoleon is always right&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;as a second motto (p. 37).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, Boxer shows&nbsp;<strong>a more critical side</strong>&nbsp;towards the second half of the story, as he is among the few animals who start questioning some of Napoleon and Squealer&rsquo;s stories later on. For example, he does not immediately accept the new narrative that describes Snowball as a traitor, as Boxer remembers that Snowball fought bravely in the battle (pp. 54-55). He is also sceptical about Squealer's attempts to turn the Battle of the Windmill into a victory for the animals (p. 71). In both cases he is eventually convinced by Squealer, however, so he never truly rebels against the pigs. He also continues to believe in Napoleon&rsquo;s wisdom, and clearly trusts the leader&rsquo;s promise that he will be allowed to retire once he gets old enough.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Boxer is shown as more&nbsp;<strong>kind-hearted</strong>&nbsp;than many of the other animals, as he feels truly sad when he believes he has killed a man by accident: &ldquo; &lsquo;He is dead&rsquo;, said Boxer sorrowfully. &lsquo;I had no intention of doing that. [...] &lsquo;I have no wish to take life, not even human life,&rsquo; repeated Boxer, and his eyes were full of tears.&rdquo; (p. 28).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Boxer life ends&nbsp;<strong>tragically</strong>, as he collapses from overwork (pp. 79-80) and is afterwards betrayed by Napoleon, who pretends to send him to a veterinarian, but in fact sells him to a horse butcher (pp. 81-84). It is interesting to note that Boxer finally&nbsp;<strong>loses his faith in Napoleon</strong>&nbsp;at this point in the story, as he does attempt to kick his way out of the van when the other animals reveal the truth of the situation to him.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="0447b5a1-830a-486d-8c62-44863270932e">Benjamin</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Benjamin is a donkey, the oldest animal on the farm. He is described as bad-tempered, and it is noted that he never laughs and often makes&nbsp;<strong>cynical</strong>remarks. He does not seem to care much for the other animals, though he does have a close relationship with Boxer (p. 2).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">His exact age is never revealed, but he often remarks that &ldquo;donkeys live a long time&rdquo; (e.g. p. 19). This quotation reflects Benjamin&rsquo;s pessimistic and cynical attitude to life. He believes he has seen everything there is to see &ndash; and he has concluded that nothing is likely to change for the better. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Therefore, Benjamin is the only animal on the farm who is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;<strong>excited</strong>&nbsp;about the Rebellion at any point, continuing to act just like he did before (p. 19). In many ways Benjamin seems more intelligent than the other animals, as he alone is fully resistant to the propaganda delivered by Squealer and Napoleon. This is made especially clear when Squealer is discovered with the can of paint by the wall of Commandments: &ldquo;None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.&rdquo; (p. 73).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">However, Benjamin does not seem to care enough about the pigs&rsquo; takeover to resist or protest. He seems to believe that such actions would be pointless, and that the rule of the pigs is neither better nor worse than Mr. Jones&rsquo; (p. 87).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The only exception to Benjamin&rsquo;s passive behaviour occurs when Boxer is taken away in the van. Benjamin suddenly shows unusual passion and is very eager to tell the other animals the truth, in a desperate effort to stop his friend Boxer from being taken away: &ldquo; &lsquo;Fools! Fools!&rsquo; shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. &lsquo;Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 81).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Benjamin is one of the few animals who survive all the way to the end of the book (p. 85), despite being the oldest animal even at the beginning.</span></p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="0de825b9-1c11-48be-86fa-5981d832c677">Other characters</h2><h3 id="heading-7">Old Major</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Old Major is a prize-winning boar at the Manor Farm, twelve years old but still &ldquo;majestic-looking&rdquo; and with a &ldquo;wise and benevolent appearance&rdquo; (p.1).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Old Major only appears at the beginning of his story, but his speech creates the foundation of the Rebellion. He describes the evils of Mankind (pp. 4-6) and shares a vision of an England controlled by animals (pp. 6-8). He also presents a number of laws and principles that must be followed during and after the oncoming revolution (p. 6), which later become the foundation of Animalism (pp. 9-10) and the Seven Commandments (p. 15).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even after his death, he continues to play some role in the story, as the other animals regard him as an important symbol of their Rebellion - his skull is even preserved as an almost religious item which the animals show their respect to every Sunday (p. 38). However, when Napoleon abandons the ideology of the rebellion completely in an effort to appeal to his neighbours, the skull is buried and loses its significance (p. 94).</span></p><h3 id="heading-8">Clover</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Clover is one of the horses at the farm, introduced as &ldquo;...a motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.&rdquo; (p. 2).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Right from the beginning, she is shown to be an unusually caring and compassionate animal, as one of her first act is to extend her foreleg to protect a group of orphaned ducklings (p. 2).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Clover is depicted as more intelligent than many of the other animals. Although she is at first one of the main supporters of Animalism (p. 11), she is also among the characters who seem most sceptical towards the changes the pigs gradually make on Animal Farm. She is often on the verge of realising that something disturbing is happening. However, whenever she decides to double-check the Seven Commandments or ask clarifying questions of Squealer, she is eventually brought around by the pigs&rsquo; propaganda.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, at the climax of the story, Clover is the first one who seems to realise that the pigs standing on their hind legs and carrying whips means that the ideology of the pigs&rsquo; regime has changed entirely, and that the Seven Commandments have probably changed too:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked round. It was Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without saying anything she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written.&nbsp;(p. 90)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Clover is then the first animal to lead the way up to the farmhouse to spy on the pigs, suggesting that her realisation and age have made her braver.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The third person narrator&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;">sometimes zooms in on Clover&rsquo;s perspective, which means we get an unusual level of insight into her thoughts and feelings in particular.</span></p><h3 id="heading-9">Mollie</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Mollie is a white mare (female horse), described as &lsquo;foolish&rsquo; and &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; when she is first introduced (p. 2).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">She is fond of eating sugar and wearing pretty ribbons, which makes her somewhat sceptical about the idea of a Rebellion against humanity (p. 10), since both sugar and pretty clothes come from humans. She is vain, and likes to show herself off to the other animals and looking at herself in the mirror. She is also described as more easily frightened than the others, as she runs and hides during their first major battle (p. 28).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">After the Rebellion, she is shown to struggle with the principles of the new, free society of animals. She constantly tries to avoid work, making up all kinds of excuses for showing up late and leaving early (p. 30). She still likes to decorate herself even though it is against the new rules (p. 14) and later on she is seen in the company of a human from a neighbouring farm (p. 30). When she is confronted by this fact, she runs away. Soon after, it is revealed that she has returned to the ownership of humans. She seems to be happy with her return to the old ways, and the other animals never speak of her again (p. 31).</span></p><h3 id="heading-10">Moses the raven</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Moses is a minor character who only appears briefly in the book.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">His role at the farm seems similar to some kind of religious preacher (which his name also reflects, Moses being a major figure in several religions). He does no work, but always tells tales of the wonderful Sugarcandy Mountain, which is a magical afterlife for all animals. The other animals generally dislike him, though many of them believe in his tales (pp. 10-11).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Moses is Jones&rsquo; favourite pet (p. 10) and the only animal on the farm who does not join the Rebellion, instead choosing to escape with the Joneses (p. 12). He returns later on, however, slipping right back into his former role.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Both before and after the Rebellion, the pigs seem eager to convince the other animals that Moses&rsquo; tales are all lies (pp. 10-11, 78). However, upon his return there are also signs that the pigs in fact find him useful to have around, since they allow him rations despite the fact that he does not work (p. 79).</span></p><h3 id="heading-11">Mr. Jones</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Mr. Jones is the original owner of the Manor Farm. He is described as an unsympathetic person, an alcoholic who cannot manage his farm properly (p. 11). He also hires incompetent and lazy workers, which eventually leads to his animals nearly starving and the beginning of the Rebellion (pp. 11-12).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Jones makes a desperate attempt to retake his farm later in the story, but is quickly defeated (pp. 26-27). Thereafter he seems content to leave the farm behind and he plays no further role in the story. A brief side note near the end informs us that he died in a home for alcoholics in some other part of England (p. 85). &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Jones is a symbol of Man&rsquo;s tyranny in the eye of the animals, and even after the Rebellion has succeeded Squealer often uses his name as a threat to remind the other animals of his tyrannical rule (pp. 23, 37, 46). When trying to discredit Snowball, Squealer and Napoleon even claim he had been Jones&rsquo; secret agent all along (p. 55).</span></p><h3 id="heading-12">Mr. Frederick</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Mr. Frederick owns Pinchfield, one of the farms neighbouring Animal Farm. He is introduced as &ldquo;...a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains.&rdquo; (p. 24) His political relationship with Animal Farm is complex, as Napoleon&rsquo;s propaganda switches between describing him as an enemy and as a friend.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Shortly after Napoleon has made a deal with him to sell a pile of timber, he is clearly revealed as an enemy, as he has paid for the items with false money. Soon afterwards, he leads a brutal assault on Animal Farm, much more vicious and destructive than Jones&rsquo; previous attempt. His men succeed in destroying the windmill and killing or wounding a number of animals before they are chased away.</span></p><h3 id="heading-13">Mr. Pilkington</h3><p><span style="color:black;">Mr. Pilkington owns Foxwood, the other farm neighbouring Animal Farm. In contrast to Mr. Frederick, he is introduced as &ldquo;...an easy-going gentleman-farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting&hellip;&rdquo; (p. 24).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Much like Frederick, his political relationship with Animal Farm changes throughout the story. He initially helps Jones in his first attempt to take back the farm, but in the final chapter of the story he is shown to begin a friendly relationship with Napoleon and the other pigs, as he leads a human delegation sent to observe the farm and negotiate (pp. 90-91). However, the final paragraphs of the story heavily suggest that a new conflict between pigs and humans is coming soon:</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously. (p.95)</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Mr. Pilkington considers himself a member of the upper classes and is unconcerned with the welfare of poor people, as shown by the &lsquo;joke&rsquo; he makes during the meeting with Napoleon: &ldquo; &lsquo;If you have your lower animals to contend with,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we have our lower classes!&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 92) Immediately afterwards, he also expresses admiration for Napoleon&rsquo;s harsh policies towards his workers (p. 93).</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/animal-farm/analysis/social-setting" title="Social setting | Animal Farm" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Social setting</span></a><a href="/animal-farm/interpretation" title="Interpretation | Animal Farm" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Interpretation</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, we generally do not have direct access to his perspective, but mostly learn of his actions and plans from the point of view of the other animals. This echoes the way in which Napoleon carries out most of his plans in secret and removes himself from the daily lives of the animals to become a figurehead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eHe is a pig, described as a \u0026ldquo;rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar\u0026rdquo; (p. 9).

After the cows have been milked, he suspiciously stays behind - and we later learn it was to make sure that the milk went to the pigs. Throughout the story we see similar efforts to seize more resources for himself and his upper class of pigs, such as his takeover of the farmhouse with its modern conveniences and his schemes to obtain apples and alcohol. The most dramatic expression of his greed is when he sacrifices Boxer\u0026rsquo;s life to purchase a crate of whisky towards the end of the story (pp. 81-84).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eNapoleon\u0026rsquo;s greed does not stop at resources, as he is also\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ehungry for power\u003c/strong\u003e. As the story progresses, we witness his gradual takeover of Animal Farm. At first, he is Snowball\u0026rsquo;s political rival and the two of them compete for control. However, the hostile takeover at the windmill meeting leaves Napoleon alone in a position of power. He takes advantage of this position to end the tradition of political debates and voting, putting all power in the hands of a special committee of pigs (p. 36).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eTowards the end of the story, Napoleon increasingly resembles\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ea dictator\u003c/strong\u003e. He lives in isolation and only shows himself when surrounded by his guard dogs. He even forms a cult of personality around himself, ensuring that all the animals become completely devoted to him and with the help of Squealer he spreads propaganda that greatly exaggerates his abilities (pp. 62-63).

He is also sceptical about Squealer\u0027s attempts to turn the Battle of the Windmill into a victory for the animals (p. 71). In both cases he is eventually convinced by Squealer, however, so he never truly rebels against the pigs.

He also presents a number of laws and principles that must be followed during and after the oncoming revolution (p. 6), which later become the foundation of Animalism (pp. 9-10) and the Seven Commandments (p. 15).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eEven after his death, he continues to play some role in the story, as the other animals regard him as an important symbol of their Rebellion - his skull is even preserved as an almost religious item which the animals show their respect to every Sunday (p. 38). However, when Napoleon abandons the ideology of the rebellion completely in an effort to appeal to his neighbours, the skull is buried and loses its significance (p. 94).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022\u003eClover\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eClover is one of the horses at the farm, introduced as \u0026ldquo;...a motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.\u0026rdquo; (p. 2).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eRight from the beginning, she is shown to be an unusually caring and compassionate animal, as one of her first act is to extend her foreleg to protect a group of orphaned ducklings (p. 2).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eClover is depicted as more intelligent than many of the other animals. Although she is at first one of the main supporters of Animalism (p. 11), she is also among the characters who seem most sceptical towards the changes the pigs gradually make on Animal Farm. She is often on the verge of realising that something disturbing is happening. However, whenever she decides to double-check the Seven Commandments or ask clarifying questions of Squealer, she is eventually brought around by the pigs\u0026rsquo; propaganda.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eHowever, at the climax of the story, Clover is the first one who seems to realise that the pigs standing on their hind legs and carrying whips means that the ideology of the pigs\u0026rsquo; regime has changed entirely, and that the Seven Commandments have probably changed too:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eBenjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder.

She is vain, and likes to show herself off to the other animals and looking at herself in the mirror. She is also described as more easily frightened than the others, as she runs and hides during their first major battle (p. 28).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAfter the Rebellion, she is shown to struggle with the principles of the new, free society of animals. She constantly tries to avoid work, making up all kinds of excuses for showing up late and leaving early (p. 30). She still likes to decorate herself even though it is against the new rules (p. 14) and later on she is seen in the company of a human from a neighbouring farm (p. 30). When she is confronted by this fact, she runs away. Soon after, it is revealed that she has returned to the ownership of humans. She seems to be happy with her return to the old ways, and the other animals never speak of her again (p. 31).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-10\u0022\u003eMoses the raven\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMoses is a minor character who only appears briefly in the book.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eHis role at the farm seems similar to some kind of religious preacher (which his name also reflects, Moses being a major figure in several religions). He does no work, but always tells tales of the wonderful Sugarcandy Mountain, which is a magical afterlife for all animals. The other animals generally dislike him, though many of them believe in his tales (pp. 10-11).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMoses is Jones\u0026rsquo; favourite pet (p. 10) and the only animal on the farm who does not join the Rebellion, instead choosing to escape with the Joneses (p. 12).

However, upon his return there are also signs that the pigs in fact find him useful to have around, since they allow him rations despite the fact that he does not work (p. 79).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-11\u0022\u003eMr. Jones\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMr. Jones is the original owner of the Manor Farm. He is described as an unsympathetic person, an alcoholic who cannot manage his farm properly (p. 11). He also hires incompetent and lazy workers, which eventually leads to his animals nearly starving and the beginning of the Rebellion (pp. 11-12).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eJones makes a desperate attempt to retake his farm later in the story, but is quickly defeated (pp. 26-27). Thereafter he seems content to leave the farm behind and he plays no further role in the story. A brief side note near the end informs us that he died in a home for alcoholics in some other part of England (p. 85). \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eJones is a symbol of Man\u0026rsquo;s tyranny in the eye of the animals, and even after the Rebellion has succeeded Squealer often uses his name as a threat to remind the other animals of his tyrannical rule (pp. 23, 37, 46). When trying to discredit Snowball, Squealer and Napoleon even claim he had been Jones\u0026rsquo; secret agent all along (p. 55).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-12\u0022\u003eMr. Frederick\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMr. Frederick owns Pinchfield, one of the farms neighbouring Animal Farm. He is introduced as \u0026ldquo;...a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains.\u0026rdquo; (p. 24) His political relationship with Animal Farm is complex, as Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s propaganda switches between describing him as an enemy and as a friend.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eShortly after Napoleon has made a deal with him to sell a pile of timber, he is clearly revealed as an enemy, as he has paid for the items with false money.

He initially helps Jones in his first attempt to take back the farm, but in the final chapter of the story he is shown to begin a friendly relationship with Napoleon and the other pigs, as he leads a human delegation sent to observe the farm and negotiate (pp. 90-91). However, the final paragraphs of the story heavily suggest that a new conflict between pigs and humans is coming soon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eYes, a violent quarrel was in progress. There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials.
