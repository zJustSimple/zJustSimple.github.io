Once he has gone to bed, the animals around the farm become active, making their way to the barn because they have heard rumours that old Major, Mr. Jones&rsquo; prize boar, has had a strange dream that he wishes to share with them.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We are introduced to each of the animals as they arrive. When everyone is present, Major begins his speech. He starts out by saying that he believes he will die soon and that he wishes to share his wisdom. Then he tells the other animals about the ways in which humans take advantage of them - feeding them barely enough to survive, and forcing them to work extremely hard, before finally slaughtering them when they are no longer useful. Major insists that England has plenty of resources for everyone - the problem is that humans keeps stealing them for themselves. Because of human beings&rsquo; crimes, Major tells the animals that the time will soon come for a rebellion. The animals agree that all of them must stand together as comrades in the struggle against humans - wild animals as well as farm animals.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Before moving on to his dream, Major notes that the animals must never descend to the level of human beings. To this end, he lists a number of rules or commandments that they must follow during and after the revolution. For example, no animal shall ever kill another animal. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Major then talks briefly about his dream of the earth as it will be when humans have vanished. Finally, he shares an old song called &lsquo;Beasts of England&rsquo;, which talks about the end of human beings&rsquo; reign. The animals sing the song together with great passion, before their meeting is finally brought to an end by Mr. Jones. He is awoken by the noise and shoots a gun from his window, believing a fox has entered the yard. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="afaf8bc5-2e17-44a3-8d14-e01b6d5a6f74">Chapter II</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Three nights after the meeting, old Major dies. His ideas continue to be popular among the animals, however, and the pigs take it upon themselves to educate the other animals on the principles necessary for achieving the revolution. Three pigs play especially important roles in this work - Napoleon, Snowball and Squealer. Together they create a form of political philosophy they call Animalism, and they try to teach the other animals about their ways. Some animals have trouble understanding the complex ideas they present, but they mostly accept them. The pigs particularly gain the loyalty of the two horses, Boxer and Clover.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We are briefly introduced to Mr. Jones&rsquo; pet raven Moses. Moses is unpopular among the animals because he does not work, but instead simply tells stories about Sugarcandy Mountain, a sort of animal paradise. Many of the animals believe his stories and the pigs find it difficult to change their minds.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The rebellion happens soon afterwards, almost by accident. Mr. Jones has grown increasingly drunken and irresponsible, which leads to the animals being left unfed for a long time. They finally break into Mr. Jones&rsquo; food stores. Mr. Jones and his men discover this and try to chase them away, but they do not expect the animals to resist and therefore quickly flee the farm when they are attacked - along with Mrs. Jones and Moses the raven.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At first the animals are extremely excited to be free. They tear down or burn parts of the farm that remind them of being oppressed. They carefully enter the farmhouse itself and decide that it should be preserved as a museum - but that no animal must ever live there. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The pigs reveal that they have learned to read and write, and they paint a new sign for the farm, naming their free community &lsquo;Animal Farm&rsquo;. They also make a formal list of seven commandments that all animals must obey, inspired by old Major&rsquo;s speech in Chapter I.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The animals find the commandments inspirational, but are soon distracted by impending farm work. The cows need milking and the pigs help them, but before it can be decided what is to happen with the resulting milk, Snowball leads the animals off to begin the harvest while Napoleon stays behind. When they come back in the evening, the milk is gone.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="0d980429-edfe-40bf-9c28-dae2956facdf">Chapter III</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The harvest is a great success, as the animals work efficiently together. The pigs assume leadership, while the other animals help in any way they can. The horse Boxer seems particularly excited by the new situation and works harder than ever before. Most of the animals seem very happy with their new lives, as they have both more food and more leisure time. The donkey, Benjamin, seems more sceptical about things.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We learn that Sundays are reserved for political meetings, in which the pigs propose resolutions and the animals all vote. Though all animals are in principle allowed to propose things, in practice the pigs are the only ones with the education to do so. Snowball and Napoleon make most of the proposals and lead most of the debates, though they never seem to agree on anything.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Snowball organises various classes and committees in the animals&rsquo; spare time, which leads to some of them learning to read or write to some extent. A simpler version of the Seven Commandments is created for the animals who are unable to remember them - &lsquo;four legs good, two legs bad&rsquo;. The sheep are particularly fond of this &ndash; they chant it whenever they can.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon decides to focus his efforts on educating the young, and takes nine new-born puppies to a secret room to train them.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">It is revealed that the milk that disappeared went to the pigs, along with all of the apples which were collected. Some of the other animals are upset by this, but Squealer explains to them that the pigs need proper nutrition if they are to work as leaders. He also threatens the animals by saying that Jones will return if the pigs cannot lead properly. This makes the protests die down, as no animal wants to see Jones return.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="8784fd49-2a76-447f-b1f9-c7c087fbe26c">Chapter IV</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The ideas behind the rebellion at Animal Farm start to spread to other animals in the area. The song &ldquo;Beasts of England&rdquo; becomes well-known everywhere and other animals start acting rebelliously in various ways. The humans first dismiss the stories about Animal Farm as ridiculous, but eventually grow frightened that the rebellion might spread to their farms as well. Finally, Jones organises an attempt to take back control of his farms - as all the other farmers are also interested in putting a stop to the rule of the animals.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Lead by Snowball, the animals swiftly manage to drive the humans away through clever tactics, though a sheep is killed by Jones&rsquo; rifle. After the battle, Boxer believes that he has killed a young stable-boy with a kick. He seems regretful, but Snowball tells him this kind of thing is to be expected in war. However, it turns out that the boy was only stunned, and he manages to escape while the animals are distracted.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The animals recover Mr. Jones&rsquo; gun and decide to fire it twice a year, in memory of their battle and of the Rebellion itself.</span></p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="076b4597-d800-4cc7-a881-6a260ffa4ce4">Chapter V</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The horse Mollie seems to struggle to adapt to life at Animal Farm. She constantly finds excuses to avoid work and she seems to miss being in contact with humans, who fed her sugar and gave her pretty ribbons to wear. As Clover confronts her with the fact that she has been seen with a human from the neighbouring farm, she seems distressed and denies everything. Soon after this, she runs away and is later seen in the property of a human, seemingly enjoying herself.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The farm falls upon hard times and the pigs secure more political power for themselves. Snowball and Napoleon still disagree violently on most issues, however, with Napoleon being critical of many of Snowball&rsquo;s ambitious plans to improve production and welfare. This is particularly clear in the case of Snowball&rsquo;s plan to construct a windmill. Snowball claims that while this will require a year of difficult labour, eventually the animals will only need to work three days a week. Napoleon instead recommends a focus on immediate food production and warns that the animals will starve to death if they join Snowball. Two political factions are formed on the issue. Only Benjamin the donkey remains neutral between them, sceptical that either will bring any improvement.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon and Snowball also disagree about the best way to defend the farm. Napoleon wishes to get firearms and train animals in their use, while Snowball argues that they should focus on encouraging rebellion on other farms, so they will eventually have no enemies to defend themselves against.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The day of the windmill vote arrives. Snowball seems to be winning the debate, but before the vote can begin nine vicious dogs arrive and chase him away. They are the puppies Napoleon took away for private training earlier on - and his military takeover now gives him full political control of the farm. He declares that there is no longer any reason to have political meetings, since they are a waste of time. He notes that all political leadership will go to a special committee of pigs, led by Napoleon himself.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Squealer goes to explain the new state of affairs to the other animals on the farm. He tells them that Napoleon has only assumed the heavy burden of leadership for the good of everyone, and further states that Snowball was little better than a criminal. He also repeats the threat that Jones will come back if the leadership is questioned.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">To the animals&rsquo; surprise, Napoleon later reveals that construction of the windmill will go ahead after all, and that it will require many sacrifices. He claims that Snowball originally stole the plans from him, and argues that this was why he opposed it at first. Thanks to the menacing guard dogs, the other animals eventually accept his questionable explanation and go along with the new plan.</span></p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="246e8430-f52d-4437-9601-ecc25cc9296a">Chapter VI</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The animals work extremely hard to complete the windmill plan, even getting extra work duties on Sundays. The harvest does not go as well as the year before, because they are focusing on the windmill. The building work is only possible because of the tireless power of Boxer the horse.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In general, the animals are still not worse off than before the Rebellion, however, but they start to need some resources that they cannot get on their own. Napoleon announces that they will start trading with the neighbouring farms to get these things.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The animals are a bit disturbed by this, as many of them recall that one of the old Major&rsquo;s main rules for the Rebellion was to avoid engaging in trade or similar human activities. Once again, Napoleon&rsquo;s dogs silence their protests. Furthermore, Napoleon reassures the animals that he will handle all human communication himself, so they will be spared human contact. Squealer once again makes his rounds on the farm, telling the animals that there had really been no rule against trade and that they must have dreamed it somehow.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Animal Farm becomes a somewhat more respected community among the humans, many of whom are impressed by the animals&rsquo; abilities. Rumours start spreading that Napoleon might be about to enter further business agreements.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The pigs decide to move into the farmhouse. Once again, the animals are upset, as this seems to contradict earlier rules. Once again, they are persuaded that this new arrangement is really for the common good. The pigs even start sleeping in human beds. Clover the horse and Muriel the goat are disturbed by this, as it seems to go against a written Commandment. However, when they check the Commandments on the wall, they discover that the new rules still fit with the Fourth Commandment, because of an addition about sheets that they do not remember being there before.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">By Autumn, the windmill is half complete. Though the animals suffer from lack of food, they are proud of the work they have done on the mill and look forward to a bright future. However, a violent storm leaves the windmill completely ruined. Napoleon tells the other animals that Snowball is responsible for the destruction and issues a death sentence against him, as well as a reward for his capture. The animals seem convinced by this explanation, as tracks of a pig are indeed found near the ruins, seemingly leading to a neighbouring farm. Napoleon finally declares that work on the windmill will continue, regardless of the setback.</span></p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="435aa0f8-9d7c-4688-bd64-b3115d78e131">Chapter VII</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Winter arrives. The lack of resources and the hard work involved in rebuilding the windmill (with thicker walls than before) makes the morale of the animals suffer greatly. Boxer and Clover still seem dedicated, however.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In January a failed potato crop leads to near-starvation at the farm. The animals are desperate to conceal this fact from the human neighbours, who must not detect any weakness. Napoleon uses various strategies to convince his human intermediary, Mr. Whymper, that the situation is better than it seems - and Mr. Whymper reports this optimistic view to the outside world. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon finally announces a drastic plan to counter the lack of food. He has made a contract that involves selling a large number of eggs in exchange for other food items. The hens are greatly upset by this and stage the first attempt at a rebellion against Napoleon. Napoleon responds by taking the hens&rsquo; rations away and after several days of hunger - and several deaths - they surrender and go along with the plan.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">It is reported that Snowball is sneaking into the farm at night. Whenever something bad happens from then on, Snowball is blamed for it. Napoleon and his dogs investigate, each time finding clear evidence that Snowball has been there. Eventually Squealer declares that it has been discovered that Snowball is in league with one of the neighbouring farms. He further claims that Snowball was Jones&rsquo; secret agent when the Rebellion began.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Some animals question this explanation, remembering how bravely Snowball fought against Jones earlier. Squealer insists on an alternative history of events in which Snowball was really trying to lead the animals to defeat, and his explanation is so convincing that the animals start to believe it.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Squealer mentions that secret agents of Snowball might be among them, and in a violent demonstration of power Napoleon later has his dogs pull up four pigs from the crowd at one of his meetings. They confess to all manner of crimes, before being brutally executed by Napoleon&rsquo;s dogs. He asks for more confessions, and a number of other animals step up, confess to committing crimes in league with Snowball, and are all executed.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The surviving animals get together and reflect on their sad new reality. They note that this is not the future they imagined when the Rebellion first started, and together they start singing &lsquo;Beasts of England&rsquo; to remember their ideals. Squealer arrives to tell them that &lsquo;Beasts of England&rsquo; is now forbidden, as it is no longer needed now that the Rebellion is completed and the remaining traitors gone.</span></p><h2 id="heading-8" data-guid="608722ee-de7f-4b35-b942-b67043edc6c1">Chapter VIII</h2><p><span style="color:black;">After the executions, some of the animals recall that one of the Seven Commandments stated that no animal shall kill any other animal, and they go to the wall of commandments to check. They discover that the Commandment states that no animal shall kill any other animal&nbsp;<em>without cause</em>, and therefore they cannot argue against Napoleon&rsquo;s acts.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Conditions become increasingly difficult on the farm. The animals work much harder and eat less food, though Squealer keeps trying to convince them that food production is better than ever. Napoleon increasingly isolates himself, and is only seen rarely - always escorted by his vicious dogs. At the same time, he becomes an increasingly important figure in the minds of the animals, as he gains more titles and fantastic tales are told about his goodness and excellent leadership. The farm&rsquo;s poet Minimus (whose identity is unclear) even composes a song in his honour, listing all of his great virtues.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Rumours of a new attack on the farm start to spread, and Napoleon tightens security around himself. He also spreads many disturbing tales about the evils of the neighbouring farmer, Frederick, who threatens their security.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The windmill is finally completed and Napoleon congratulates the animals on their hard work. He then reveals that he has made a business deal with Frederick - and claims that all of the previous evil tales about him must have been spread by Snowball and his agents. He further argues that the true enemy is the other neighbouring farmer, Pilkington.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon is proud of his business cunning, but soon after his deal with Frederick it is revealed that the money was fake and Frederick becomes the face of the enemy once more.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Soon after, Frederick and his men lead a direct attack on Animal Farm. The men have superior weapons and soon take control of the farm buildings. They go to the windmill and blow it to pieces with explosives. Enraged by this, the surviving animals renew their attack and eventually drive the humans off, though they suffer heavy losses in the process. Boxer the horse suffers a split hoof and various other injuries.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The animals feel defeated after the destruction of the windmill, but Squealer and Napoleon convince them that the day should really be counted as a victory, as they have chased the humans off their land.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The pigs discover some whisky left behind by Mr. Jones and they have a mysterious gathering in the farmhouse. The next morning it is announced that Napoleon is dying and has banned alcohol as his last act in life, though he swiftly gets better in the evening. Soon after, he embarks on a plan to grow barley and create a brewery.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">While this is going on, Squealer falls from a ladder near the Commandment wall, a can of white paint beside him. None of the animals can figure out what this means, with the possible exception of Benjamin the donkey. &nbsp;A few days later, the Commandment which prohibited alcohol is shown to have a new addition, and it now merely prohibits drinking to excess.</span></p><h2 id="heading-9" data-guid="38613d20-0198-4631-aa35-f398b4619ab4">Chapter IX</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Boxer&rsquo;s split hoof from the battle continues to trouble him and he is in constant pain, but is determined to work as hard as ever on rebuilding the mill. We learn that Animal Farm has established rules for retirement, which means that Boxer, being a horse, is able to retire when he is twelve years old.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The winter is as cold as the last one and food is once again short. Rations are reduced for everyone except dogs and pigs. Squealer continues to claim that they are better off than they ever were when Jones was in control, despite the harsh circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">A new generation of pigs are born, most seemingly fathered by Napoleon himself. New rules are established which give pigs more privileges compared to other animals, and resources are put aside to build a schoolroom for them.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Rations are reduced again, but the pigs mysteriously seem to grow fatter than ever. The brewing of beer begins, and it is included in the pigs&rsquo; rations but not available to anyone else.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon hosts a number of Spontaneous Demonstrations, which are political rallies meant to honour Animal Farm and its great leader, Comrade Napoleon. The Farm is turned into a Republic and Napoleon becomes President, with no one opposing him.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Moses the raven returns to the farm and continues to tell stories about a magical afterlife. The pigs publicly declare that his stories are lies, but they still permit him to stay and even give him a ration of beer.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Boxer continues to work hard, but his age is starting to show and his health is clearly in decline. Still, he remains determined to put in as much work as possible before his pension comes, dismissing advice that he should work less hard.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Eventually he collapses while at work, his lung giving out. Squealer arrives and assures the animals that Boxer will be sent to a hospital to get treatment. The animals are a bit nervous about this, but Squealer convinces them that the best treatment can be found among humans. Boxer partially recovers, and seems to be in good spirits and looking forward to his retirement years.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">A van arrives to take Boxer away and the animals excitedly gather around to say goodbye. However, Benjamin the donkey yells that they are all fools, and reveals that the wagon belongs to a horse butcher. The animals, horrified, try to warn Boxer to get out, but the van drives off with him despite his attempts to kick his way out.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Three days later, Squealer arrives to announce that Boxer sadly died in the hospital. He assures them that the rumours about a horse butcher are false, as he explains that the van merely used to belong to a butcher, before being taken over by the veterinarian. The animals seem convinced by this and they hold a funeral in Boxer&rsquo;s honour.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Shortly after Boxer&rsquo;s death, the pigs receive a delivery of another crate of whisky. It is unclear where the pigs got the money from.</span></p><h2 id="heading-10" data-guid="0125d8d9-2b78-4781-aabf-72cc8770fcf3">Chapter X</h2><p><span style="color:black;">The story jumps several years ahead, to a future when most of the animals from the old days are dead. Clover the horse, Benjamin the donkey, Moses the Raven and a few pigs remain, however (including Squealer and Napoleon).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Even though many animals have grown old, no-one has been allowed to retire. The pigs have grown fatter than ever. The windmill is complete, and the farm is doing well overall, though the windmill is used for profits rather than for improving the conditions of the working animals. The pigs and dogs seem to be doing very well, however.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The other animals are increasingly unable to remember a time when life has been any different, so they mostly accept things as they are. Despite hard labour and hunger, they still maintain a strong pride in belonging to Animal Farm, the only free farm operated entirely by animals. They still believe in a glorious future for all animals and they remain confident in the knowledge that all animals are equal in their world.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">One day, the animals enter the yard and see a terrible sight. The pigs have started to walk on their hind legs like humans, and Napoleon himself is even seen to be carrying a whip. The animals are shocked by this, but before they can react the sheep start repeating a new chant declaring that two legs are, in fact, better than four.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Clover and Benjamin are upset by this, and they make their way to the wall of commandments. Here, they discover that there is just a single commandment left: &ldquo;ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS&rdquo;.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The pigs all start carrying whips and they adopt more human-like habits. One day a large group of humans arrive, invited by Napoleon to see his farm. The animals are confused by this, but also curious. Eventually, they decide to sneak up on the farmhouse to see how Napoleon and the pigs get along with their human visitors.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">As they gaze into the room, Mr. Pilkington starts to give a speech praising Napoleon for his efficient methods, noting that he efficiently manages to deal with the lower animals, just as humans have to contend with the lower classes.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon makes a speech in reply, promising future cooperation. He also reassures the humans that any talk of spreading a revolution is silly, and that he is implementing measures to prevent any such thing from happening. Furthermore, he is renaming Animal Farm with its original name, the Manor Farm. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">As the animal cast a final glance on the gathering in the farm-house, they see that the meeting has turned into a violent discussion as Napoleon and Pilkington try to cheat each other in a card game. Furthermore, they are shocked to realise that the faces of pigs and men have both changed - and that it is now impossible to tell them apart.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../summary.html" title="Summary Animal Farm" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a><a href="../rezumat.html" title="Ferma animalelor Rezumat" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Once he has gone to bed, the animals around the farm become active, making their way to the barn because they have heard rumours that old Major, Mr. Jones\u0026rsquo; prize boar, has had a strange dream that he wishes to share with them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWe are introduced to each of the animals as they arrive. When everyone is present, Major begins his speech. He starts out by saying that he believes he will die soon and that he wishes to share his wisdom. Then he tells the other animals about the ways in which humans take advantage of them - feeding them barely enough to survive, and forcing them to work extremely hard, before finally slaughtering them when they are no longer useful. Major insists that England has plenty of resources for everyone - the problem is that humans keeps stealing them for themselves. Because of human beings\u0026rsquo; crimes, Major tells the animals that the time will soon come for a rebellion. The animals agree that all of them must stand together as comrades in the struggle against humans - wild animals as well as farm animals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eBefore moving on to his dream, Major notes that the animals must never descend to the level of human beings. To this end, he lists a number of rules or commandments that they must follow during and after the revolution. For example, no animal shall ever kill another animal. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMajor then talks briefly about his dream of the earth as it will be when humans have vanished. Finally, he shares an old song called \u0026lsquo;Beasts of England\u0026rsquo;, which talks about the end of human beings\u0026rsquo; reign. The animals sing the song together with great passion, before their meeting is finally brought to an end by Mr. Jones. He is awoken by the noise and shoots a gun from his window, believing a fox has entered the yard. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022afaf8bc5-2e17-44a3-8d14-e01b6d5a6f74\u0022\u003eChapter II\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThree nights after the meeting, old Major dies. His ideas continue to be popular among the animals, however, and the pigs take it upon themselves to educate the other animals on the principles necessary for achieving the revolution. Three pigs play especially important roles in this work - Napoleon, Snowball and Squealer. Together they create a form of political philosophy they call Animalism, and they try to teach the other animals about their ways. Some animals have trouble understanding the complex ideas they present, but they mostly accept them. The pigs particularly gain the loyalty of the two horses, Boxer and Clover.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWe are briefly introduced to Mr. Jones\u0026rsquo; pet raven Moses. Moses is unpopular among the animals because he does not work, but instead simply tells stories about Sugarcandy Mountain, a sort of animal paradise. Many of the animals believe his stories and the pigs find it difficult to change their minds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe rebellion happens soon afterwards, almost by accident. Mr. Jones has grown increasingly drunken and irresponsible, which leads to the animals being left unfed for a long time. They finally break into Mr. Jones\u0026rsquo; food stores. Mr. Jones and his men discover this and try to chase them away, but they do not expect the animals to resist and therefore quickly flee the farm when they are attacked - along with Mrs. Jones and Moses the raven.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt first the animals are extremely excited to be free. They tear down or burn parts of the farm that remind them of being oppressed. They carefully enter the farmhouse itself and decide that it should be preserved as a museum - but that no animal must ever live there. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe pigs reveal that they have learned to read and write, and they paint a new sign for the farm, naming their free community \u0026lsquo;Animal Farm\u0026rsquo;. They also make a formal list of seven commandments that all animals must obey, inspired by old Major\u0026rsquo;s speech in Chapter I.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe animals find the commandments inspirational, but are soon distracted by impending farm work. The cows need milking and the pigs help them, but before it can be decided what is to happen with the resulting milk, Snowball leads the animals off to begin the harvest while Napoleon stays behind. When they come back in the evening, the milk is gone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00220d980429-edfe-40bf-9c28-dae2956facdf\u0022\u003eChapter III\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe harvest is a great success, as the animals work efficiently together. The pigs assume leadership, while the other animals help in any way they can. The horse Boxer seems particularly excited by the new situation and works harder than ever before. Most of the animals seem very happy with their new lives, as they have both more food and more leisure time. The donkey, Benjamin, seems more sceptical about things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWe learn that Sundays are reserved for political meetings, in which the pigs propose resolutions and the animals all vote. Though all animals are in principle allowed to propose things, in practice the pigs are the only ones with the education to do so. Snowball and Napoleon make most of the proposals and lead most of the debates, though they never seem to agree on anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSnowball organises various classes and committees in the animals\u0026rsquo; spare time, which leads to some of them learning to read or write to some extent. A simpler version of the Seven Commandments is created for the animals who are unable to remember them - \u0026lsquo;four legs good, two legs bad\u0026rsquo;. The sheep are particularly fond of this \u0026ndash; they chant it whenever they can.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNapoleon decides to focus his efforts on educating the young, and takes nine new-born puppies to a secret room to train them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIt is revealed that the milk that disappeared went to the pigs, along with all of the apples which were collected. Some of the other animals are upset by this, but Squealer explains to them that the pigs need proper nutrition if they are to work as leaders. He also threatens the animals by saying that Jones will return if the pigs cannot lead properly. This makes the protests die down, as no animal wants to see Jones return.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u00228784fd49-2a76-447f-b1f9-c7c087fbe26c\u0022\u003eChapter IV\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe ideas behind the rebellion at Animal Farm start to spread to other animals in the area. The song \u0026ldquo;Beasts of England\u0026rdquo; becomes well-known everywhere and other animals start acting rebelliously in various ways. The humans first dismiss the stories about Animal Farm as ridiculous, but eventually grow frightened that the rebellion might spread to their farms as well. Finally, Jones organises an attempt to take back control of his farms - as all the other farmers are also interested in putting a stop to the rule of the animals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eLead by Snowball, the animals swiftly manage to drive the humans away through clever tactics, though a sheep is killed by Jones\u0026rsquo; rifle. After the battle, Boxer believes that he has killed a young stable-boy with a kick. He seems regretful, but Snowball tells him this kind of thing is to be expected in war. However, it turns out that the boy was only stunned, and he manages to escape while the animals are distracted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe animals recover Mr. Jones\u0026rsquo; gun and decide to fire it twice a year, in memory of their battle and of the Rebellion itself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022076b4597-d800-4cc7-a881-6a260ffa4ce4\u0022\u003eChapter V\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe horse Mollie seems to struggle to adapt to life at Animal Farm. She constantly finds excuses to avoid work and she seems to miss being in contact with humans, who fed her sugar and gave her pretty ribbons to wear. As Clover confronts her with the fact that she has been seen with a human from the neighbouring farm, she seems distressed and denies everything. Soon after this, she runs away and is later seen in the property of a human, seemingly enjoying herself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe farm falls upon hard times and the pigs secure more political power for themselves. Snowball and Napoleon still disagree violently on most issues, however, with Napoleon being critical of many of Snowball\u0026rsquo;s ambitious plans to improve production and welfare. This is particularly clear in the case of Snowball\u0026rsquo;s plan to construct a windmill. Snowball claims that while this will require a year of difficult labour, eventually the animals will only need to work three days a week. Napoleon instead recommends a focus on immediate food production and warns that the animals will starve to death if they join Snowball. Two political factions are formed on the issue. Only Benjamin the donkey remains neutral between them, sceptical that either will bring any improvement.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNapoleon and Snowball also disagree about the best way to defend the farm. Napoleon wishes to get firearms and train animals in their use, while Snowball argues that they should focus on encouraging rebellion on other farms, so they will eventually have no enemies to defend themselves against.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe day of the windmill vote arrives. Snowball seems to be winning the debate, but before the vote can begin nine vicious dogs arrive and chase him away. They are the puppies Napoleon took away for private training earlier on - and his military takeover now gives him full political control of the farm. He declares that there is no longer any reason to have political meetings, since they are a waste of time. He notes that all political leadership will go to a special committee of pigs, led by Napoleon himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSquealer goes to explain the new state of affairs to the other animals on the farm. He tells them that Napoleon has only assumed the heavy burden of leadership for the good of everyone, and further states that Snowball was little better than a criminal. He also repeats the threat that Jones will come back if the leadership is questioned.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTo the animals\u0026rsquo; surprise, Napoleon later reveals that construction of the windmill will go ahead after all, and that it will require many sacrifices. He claims that Snowball originally stole the plans from him, and argues that this was why he opposed it at first. Thanks to the menacing guard dogs, the other animals eventually accept his questionable explanation and go along with the new plan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022246e8430-f52d-4437-9601-ecc25cc9296a\u0022\u003eChapter VI\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe animals work extremely hard to complete the windmill plan, even getting extra work duties on Sundays. The harvest does not go as well as the year before, because they are focusing on the windmill. The building work is only possible because of the tireless power of Boxer the horse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIn general, the animals are still not worse off than before the Rebellion, however, but they start to need some resources that they cannot get on their own. Napoleon announces that they will start trading with the neighbouring farms to get these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe animals are a bit disturbed by this, as many of them recall that one of the old Major\u0026rsquo;s main rules for the Rebellion was to avoid engaging in trade or similar human activities. Once again, Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s dogs silence their protests. Furthermore, Napoleon reassures the animals that he will handle all human communication himself, so they will be spared human contact. Squealer once again makes his rounds on the farm, telling the animals that there had really been no rule against trade and that they must have dreamed it somehow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAnimal Farm becomes a somewhat more respected community among the humans, many of whom are impressed by the animals\u0026rsquo; abilities. Rumours start spreading that Napoleon might be about to enter further business agreements.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe pigs decide to move into the farmhouse. Once again, the animals are upset, as this seems to contradict earlier rules. Once again, they are persuaded that this new arrangement is really for the common good. The pigs even start sleeping in human beds. Clover the horse and Muriel the goat are disturbed by this, as it seems to go against a written Commandment. However, when they check the Commandments on the wall, they discover that the new rules still fit with the Fourth Commandment, because of an addition about sheets that they do not remember being there before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eBy Autumn, the windmill is half complete. Though the animals suffer from lack of food, they are proud of the work they have done on the mill and look forward to a bright future. However, a violent storm leaves the windmill completely ruined. Napoleon tells the other animals that Snowball is responsible for the destruction and issues a death sentence against him, as well as a reward for his capture. The animals seem convinced by this explanation, as tracks of a pig are indeed found near the ruins, seemingly leading to a neighbouring farm. Napoleon finally declares that work on the windmill will continue, regardless of the setback.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022 data-guid=\u0022435aa0f8-9d7c-4688-bd64-b3115d78e131\u0022\u003eChapter VII\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWinter arrives. The lack of resources and the hard work involved in rebuilding the windmill (with thicker walls than before) makes the morale of the animals suffer greatly. Boxer and Clover still seem dedicated, however.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIn January a failed potato crop leads to near-starvation at the farm. The animals are desperate to conceal this fact from the human neighbours, who must not detect any weakness. Napoleon uses various strategies to convince his human intermediary, Mr. Whymper, that the situation is better than it seems - and Mr. Whymper reports this optimistic view to the outside world. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNapoleon finally announces a drastic plan to counter the lack of food. He has made a contract that involves selling a large number of eggs in exchange for other food items. The hens are greatly upset by this and stage the first attempt at a rebellion against Napoleon. Napoleon responds by taking the hens\u0026rsquo; rations away and after several days of hunger - and several deaths - they surrender and go along with the plan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIt is reported that Snowball is sneaking into the farm at night. Whenever something bad happens from then on, Snowball is blamed for it. Napoleon and his dogs investigate, each time finding clear evidence that Snowball has been there. Eventually Squealer declares that it has been discovered that Snowball is in league with one of the neighbouring farms. He further claims that Snowball was Jones\u0026rsquo; secret agent when the Rebellion began.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSome animals question this explanation, remembering how bravely Snowball fought against Jones earlier. Squealer insists on an alternative history of events in which Snowball was really trying to lead the animals to defeat, and his explanation is so convincing that the animals start to believe it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSquealer mentions that secret agents of Snowball might be among them, and in a violent demonstration of power Napoleon later has his dogs pull up four pigs from the crowd at one of his meetings. They confess to all manner of crimes, before being brutally executed by Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s dogs. He asks for more confessions, and a number of other animals step up, confess to committing crimes in league with Snowball, and are all executed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe surviving animals get together and reflect on their sad new reality. They note that this is not the future they imagined when the Rebellion first started, and together they start singing \u0026lsquo;Beasts of England\u0026rsquo; to remember their ideals. Squealer arrives to tell them that \u0026lsquo;Beasts of England\u0026rsquo; is now forbidden, as it is no longer needed now that the Rebellion is completed and the remaining traitors gone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022 data-guid=\u0022608722ee-de7f-4b35-b942-b67043edc6c1\u0022\u003eChapter VIII\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAfter the executions, some of the animals recall that one of the Seven Commandments stated that no animal shall kill any other animal, and they go to the wall of commandments to check. They discover that the Commandment states that no animal shall kill any other animal\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ewithout cause\u003c/em\u003e, and therefore they cannot argue against Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s acts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eConditions become increasingly difficult on the farm. The animals work much harder and eat less food, though Squealer keeps trying to convince them that food production is better than ever. Napoleon increasingly isolates himself, and is only seen rarely - always escorted by his vicious dogs. At the same time, he becomes an increasingly important figure in the minds of the animals, as he gains more titles and fantastic tales are told about his goodness and excellent leadership. The farm\u0026rsquo;s poet Minimus (whose identity is unclear) even composes a song in his honour, listing all of his great virtues.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eRumours of a new attack on the farm start to spread, and Napoleon tightens security around himself.

He then reveals that he has made a business deal with Frederick - and claims that all of the previous evil tales about him must have been spread by Snowball and his agents. He further argues that the true enemy is the other neighbouring farmer, Pilkington.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNapoleon is proud of his business cunning, but soon after his deal with Frederick it is revealed that the money was fake and Frederick becomes the face of the enemy once more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eSoon after, Frederick and his men lead a direct attack on Animal Farm. The men have superior weapons and soon take control of the farm buildings. They go to the windmill and blow it to pieces with explosives. Enraged by this, the surviving animals renew their attack and eventually drive the humans off, though they suffer heavy losses in the process. Boxer the horse suffers a split hoof and various other injuries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe animals feel defeated after the destruction of the windmill, but Squealer and Napoleon convince them that the day should really be counted as a victory, as they have chased the humans off their land.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe pigs discover some whisky left behind by Mr. Jones and they have a mysterious gathering in the farmhouse. The next morning it is announced that Napoleon is dying and has banned alcohol as his last act in life, though he swiftly gets better in the evening.

None of the animals can figure out what this means, with the possible exception of Benjamin the donkey. \u0026nbsp;A few days later, the Commandment which prohibited alcohol is shown to have a new addition, and it now merely prohibits drinking to excess.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-9\u0022 data-guid=\u002238613d20-0198-4631-aa35-f398b4619ab4\u0022\u003eChapter IX\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eBoxer\u0026rsquo;s split hoof from the battle continues to trouble him and he is in constant pain, but is determined to work as hard as ever on rebuilding the mill.
