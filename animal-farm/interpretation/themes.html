However, Old Major also recalls Vladimir Lenin, a central figure in the early days of the Soviet Union. Lenin served as the head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 (the time of the October Revolution) until his death in 1924. Just as Lenin&rsquo;s ideas encouraged a group of Russians to rebel against the rule of Tsar Nicholas II, Old Major&rsquo;s ideas inspire the animals to rebel against the oppressive rule of Mr. Jones.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">After Lenin&rsquo;s death, a cult of personality was established around Lenin and his ideas, and his body was preserved and displayed in Red Square in Moscow (where it remains to this day). This is recalled by the way in which Old Major&rsquo;s skull is dug up, cleaned and presented as an object of veneration for the animals.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">In the new society, Napoleon and Snowball become the main rivals for political power, just as Josef Stalin and Leon Trotsky had their rivalries in the early days of the Soviet Union. Eventually, Napoleon seizes power and chases Snowball away, echoing how Stalin seized power and forced Trotsky into exile. The way Napoleon and Squealer try to discredit Snowball&rsquo;s reputation as a war hero mirrors the negative stories Stalin and his allies spread about Trotsky&rsquo;s military efficiency as a leader of the Red Army. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Napoleon&rsquo;s dramatic show of confessions and executions in Chapter VII mirrors Stalin&rsquo;s Great Purge, in which hundreds of thousands of political opponents were either directly executed or sent to die in prison or labour camps. Much like in&nbsp;<em>Animal Farm</em>, the &lsquo;confessions&rsquo; of the criminals were often fabrications (or at least very unreliable) since they had often been produced through torture, or were exaggerated by the government afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In general, Squealer&rsquo;s attempts to persuade the animals that Napoleon&rsquo;s rule is benefitting them and that production is improved since Jones&rsquo; time recalls Stalin&rsquo;s reliance on propaganda, which he used to brainwash citizens and convince them of his programme&rsquo;s success. Alongside this, Stalin used a network of secret police (the KGB), informers and prison camps (the gulags) in order to create an atmosphere of terror and to control his citizens. In&nbsp;<em>Animal Farm</em>, this aspect is reflected in the role of the dogs, who combine forces with Squealer to stop the animals from questioning the propaganda they are given</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Towards the end of the novel, the plot starts to reflect the events of World War II.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Mr. Frederick, the neighbour who at first seems to be Napoleon&rsquo;s ally, eventually betrays him by paying him with forged money, and then attacks Animal Farm. This reflects the relationship between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler during WWII, as they initially had a non-aggression pact, but ended up at war when Hitler attacked. &lsquo;The Battle of the Windmill&rsquo; represents Hitler&rsquo;s invasion of the Soviet Union and the ongoing efforts of the Soviets to fight back - which eventually succeeded, but with heavy losses in the process.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Mr. Pilkington and his friends represent the various capitalist powers of the world, such as the US and Great Britain. Mr. Pilkington is characterised as being &ldquo;...an easy-going gentleman-farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting&hellip;&rdquo; (p. 24). This particularly reflects Britain as characteristically being home to the upper class. The description also points to the way in which Britain and particularly the US refused to get involved with the Soviet Union or WWII until it began to affect them directly, and when they saw that it could be profitable.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">At first, Animal Farm views Mr. Pilkington as an enemy, but eventually Napoleon&rsquo;s society comes to resemble the surrounding farms and he reaches out to join them on equal terms. This echoes the way in which Stalin reached out to Britain and the US during the latter half of WWII, when the powers became allies to defeat Germany. The fact that the humans and pigs become indistinguishable (p. 95) points to the way in which the Soviet Union had started off as a radical form of Communism, but had eventually become so focused on industry and profit (especially during the war) that its methods became almost indistinguishable from those of the Capitalist Western powers.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The signs of renewed violent conflict at the very end foreshadow the strained relationship between Western powers and the Soviet Union after WWII, which eventually turned into the Cold War (though note that the novel was published a few years before the Cold War began in earnest). &nbsp;</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="c5230332-36e6-487f-83c1-4a7e7c3ef455">Revolutions in general</h2><p><span style="color:black;">Though the novel is meant as a direct parallel to the Russian Revolution (see above), it also touches upon more general concerns that apply to the idea of revolution. Many of the tendencies described can be observed in other historical revolutions - for example, the initial, joyful feeling of victory and liberation in contrast to the difficult, practical struggle involved in creating a functional government to replace the old one.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The political power struggles between various members of the rebellion, which is shown through the conflict between Snowball and Napoleon, can also be observed in many historical revolutions. The question of who is to govern the new, free society may seem simple during the time of rebellion, but quickly becomes complicated once the dust has settled and a new political reality sets in.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="54da8728-7962-4a97-80b1-6990eb3e1f36">The power of propaganda</h2><p><span style="color:black;">An important theme in&nbsp;<em>Animal Farm</em>&nbsp;is connected to the power of political propaganda. Even though their condition becomes more and more terrible, the efficient propaganda</span><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;delivered by Squealer in both speech and text usually manages to convince the other animals that they are actually well off, and effectively prevent any real attempts to rebel against Napoleon and the pigs.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The novel also shows the way propaganda can be used to&nbsp;<strong>alter the history</strong>&nbsp;of a nation, changing details to fit the story that the government wants people to believe. Creative rewriting of history is a common propaganda technique in dictatorships, and even today examples of this can be found in some states. By showing an extreme version of how history can be altered by governments, the reader is also led to consider how the way in which historical events are perceived can be subtly influenced by the political ideology of the current government.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">We also see examples of propaganda in action in the way&nbsp;<strong>enemies of the state</strong>are described, particularly in the way the stories change dramatically depending on whom Napoleon is most closely allied with at any given moment (Frederick vs. Pilkington).</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">Finally, the novel shows the efficiency of creating a&nbsp;<strong>cult of personality</strong>&nbsp;around a supreme leader, which is another technique frequently used in dictatorships (even today). This technique is based on creating an image in which the nation&rsquo;s leader is presented as superhuman with immense personal qualities, and as single-handedly responsible for the welfare and security of the nation. By creating a cult of personality, Napoleon (and Stalin) ensured that citizens were less likely to question the leader&rsquo;s decisions and made them more likely to accept even contradictory or unclear information. In&nbsp;<em>Animal Farm</em>, this is particularly seen in the character of Boxer, who repeats the phrase &lsquo;Napoleon is always right&rsquo; to reassure himself and others.</span></p><p><span style="color:black;">The sheep could be seen as a symbol of state-controlled media, repeating the information given to them by the government. This shows how government propaganda can be strengthened and shared, effectively drowning out any attempt at protests.</span></p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="allegory.html" title="Allegory | Animal Farm" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Allegory</span></a><a href="message.html" title="Message | Animal Farm" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Message</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, Old Major also recalls Vladimir Lenin, a central figure in the early days of the Soviet Union. Lenin served as the head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 (the time of the October Revolution) until his death in 1924. Just as Lenin\u0026rsquo;s ideas encouraged a group of Russians to rebel against the rule of Tsar Nicholas II, Old Major\u0026rsquo;s ideas inspire the animals to rebel against the oppressive rule of Mr. Jones.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAfter Lenin\u0026rsquo;s death, a cult of personality was established around Lenin and his ideas, and his body was preserved and displayed in Red Square in Moscow (where it remains to this day). This is recalled by the way in which Old Major\u0026rsquo;s skull is dug up, cleaned and presented as an object of veneration for the animals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eIn the new society, Napoleon and Snowball become the main rivals for political power, just as Josef Stalin and Leon Trotsky had their rivalries in the early days of the Soviet Union. Eventually, Napoleon seizes power and chases Snowball away, echoing how Stalin seized power and forced Trotsky into exile. The way Napoleon and Squealer try to discredit Snowball\u0026rsquo;s reputation as a war hero mirrors the negative stories Stalin and his allies spread about Trotsky\u0026rsquo;s military efficiency as a leader of the Red Army. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eNapoleon\u0026rsquo;s dramatic show of confessions and executions in Chapter VII mirrors Stalin\u0026rsquo;s Great Purge, in which hundreds of thousands of political opponents were either directly executed or sent to die in prison or labour camps. Much like in\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/em\u003e, the \u0026lsquo;confessions\u0026rsquo; of the criminals were often fabrications (or at least very unreliable) since they had often been produced through torture, or were exaggerated by the government afterwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eIn general, Squealer\u0026rsquo;s attempts to persuade the animals that Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s rule is benefitting them and that production is improved since Jones\u0026rsquo; time recalls Stalin\u0026rsquo;s reliance on propaganda, which he used to brainwash citizens and convince them of his programme\u0026rsquo;s success. Alongside this, Stalin used a network of secret police (the KGB), informers and prison camps (the gulags) in order to create an atmosphere of terror and to control his citizens. In\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/em\u003e, this aspect is reflected in the role of the dogs, who combine forces with Squealer to stop the animals from questioning the propaganda they are given\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eTowards the end of the novel, the plot starts to reflect the events of World War II.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMr. Frederick, the neighbour who at first seems to be Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s ally, eventually betrays him by paying him with forged money, and then attacks Animal Farm. This reflects the relationship between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler during WWII, as they initially had a non-aggression pact, but ended up at war when Hitler attacked. \u0026lsquo;The Battle of the Windmill\u0026rsquo; represents Hitler\u0026rsquo;s invasion of the Soviet Union and the ongoing efforts of the Soviets to fight back - which eventually succeeded, but with heavy losses in the process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eMr. Pilkington and his friends represent the various capitalist powers of the world, such as the US and Great Britain. Mr. Pilkington is characterised as being \u0026ldquo;...an easy-going gentleman-farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (p. 24). This particularly reflects Britain as characteristically being home to the upper class. The description also points to the way in which Britain and particularly the US refused to get involved with the Soviet Union or WWII until it began to affect them directly, and when they saw that it could be profitable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAt first, Animal Farm views Mr. Pilkington as an enemy, but eventually Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s society comes to resemble the surrounding farms and he reaches out to join them on equal terms. This echoes the way in which Stalin reached out to Britain and the US during the latter half of WWII, when the powers became allies to defeat Germany. The fact that the humans and pigs become indistinguishable (p. 95) points to the way in which the Soviet Union had started off as a radical form of Communism, but had eventually become so focused on industry and profit (especially during the war) that its methods became almost indistinguishable from those of the Capitalist Western powers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe signs of renewed violent conflict at the very end foreshadow the strained relationship between Western powers and the Soviet Union after WWII, which eventually turned into the Cold War (though note that the novel was published a few years before the Cold War began in earnest). \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c5230332-36e6-487f-83c1-4a7e7c3ef455\u0022\u003eRevolutions in general\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThough the novel is meant as a direct parallel to the Russian Revolution (see above), it also touches upon more general concerns that apply to the idea of revolution. Many of the tendencies described can be observed in other historical revolutions - for example, the initial, joyful feeling of victory and liberation in contrast to the difficult, practical struggle involved in creating a functional government to replace the old one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe political power struggles between various members of the rebellion, which is shown through the conflict between Snowball and Napoleon, can also be observed in many historical revolutions. The question of who is to govern the new, free society may seem simple during the time of rebellion, but quickly becomes complicated once the dust has settled and a new political reality sets in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002254da8728-7962-4a97-80b1-6990eb3e1f36\u0022\u003eThe power of propaganda\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eAn important theme in\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;is connected to the power of political propaganda. Even though their condition becomes more and more terrible, the efficient propaganda\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003e\u0026nbsp;delivered by Squealer in both speech and text usually manages to convince the other animals that they are actually well off, and effectively prevent any real attempts to rebel against Napoleon and the pigs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe novel also shows the way propaganda can be used to\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ealter the history\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;of a nation, changing details to fit the story that the government wants people to believe. Creative rewriting of history is a common propaganda technique in dictatorships, and even today examples of this can be found in some states. By showing an extreme version of how history can be altered by governments, the reader is also led to consider how the way in which historical events are perceived can be subtly influenced by the political ideology of the current government.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eWe also see examples of propaganda in action in the way\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eenemies of the state\u003c/strong\u003eare described, particularly in the way the stories change dramatically depending on whom Napoleon is most closely allied with at any given moment (Frederick vs. Pilkington).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eFinally, the novel shows the efficiency of creating a\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ecult of personality\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;around a supreme leader, which is another technique frequently used in dictatorships (even today). This technique is based on creating an image in which the nation\u0026rsquo;s leader is presented as superhuman with immense personal qualities, and as single-handedly responsible for the welfare and security of the nation. By creating a cult of personality, Napoleon (and Stalin) ensured that citizens were less likely to question the leader\u0026rsquo;s decisions and made them more likely to accept even contradictory or unclear information. In\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/em\u003e, this is particularly seen in the character of Boxer, who repeats the phrase \u0026lsquo;Napoleon is always right\u0026rsquo; to reassure himself and others.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:black;\u0022\u003eThe sheep could be seen as a symbol of state-controlled media, repeating the information given to them by the government.
