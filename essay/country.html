De la orașe dens populate și decorate cu zgârie-nori până la cultura din satele liniștite, Eseul ne descrie atât frumusețea tradiționalistă a japoniei, cât și obiceiurile stricte urmate de oameni în această țară. În Japonia se spune că făra profesori nu ar exista conducători, așa că citeștee Essay about Japan pentru a-ți onora profesorul cu o compunere bine scrisă, iar acesta te va onora cu o notă de 10.</p><h3 id="heading-vp5m2" title="ID: heading-vp5m2">Essay</h3><p>Also known as &ldquo;The Land of the Rising Sun&rdquo;, Japan is a unique and intriguing country situated on the most eastern part of Asia. You will find that the country has a rich history, a vast culture and beautiful landscapes. Be it immense cities with skyscrapers and shining lights or a quiet village with lots of spectacular flowers, you will find what you are looking for in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>People who live in this country tend to pay a lot of attention to details, manners and hard work. The school system is renowned for being harsh and rewarding those who do their best. They take immense pride in their family name and honour, so dropping out of school is considered extremely disrespectful to one&rsquo;s ancestors. Education is taken so seriously that the only people who are not required to bow down before the emperor are teachers, because they think that without educators there would be no rulers.</p><p>Furthermore, they value manners, which also stem from education. Go into any given store, bank or other business and you shall be greeted not by one, but by every staff member that is present. This automatically makes you feel as if you are a welcomed guest, but I imagine it can get fairly annoying for people to have to do this every day with every customer that arrives or departs. Nevertheless, it is a sign of respect and it should be appreciated as such. They also have strict policies when entering someone&rsquo;s home, when accepting a gift, when waiting in line for the bus or train and for all other sorts of activities. As well-intended as they may be, one has to question how stressful all this strictness is to a human.</p><p>Economically speaking, Japan is well known for its stable economy and availability for work positions as long as you&rsquo;ve got the necessary skills. Competition is harsh in the better paying job market due to the high education rate of the country, but usually not too many people get left behind because of the ever increasing number of businesses. But with an immense population and money being so numerous comes inflation. Prices aren&rsquo;t great in crowded cities such as Tokyo, especially when it comes to renting an apartment. But the Japanese have seemingly found a solution for this as well, because a lot of them opt for a subscription to an internet coffee shop where they spend days and nights searching for jobs in their ever growing market.</p><p>I almost forgot to mention their extraordinary cuisine. Japan is renowned for their sushi, which has garnered popularity all around the globe. Their cuisine has arguably become an exotic delicacy and a gourmand&rsquo;s number one choice every so often. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re missing until you have not tried it.</p><p>Suffice to say that each country has its fair share of good and bad things, but Japan has a talent of making all the imperfect aspects fade away when compared to all the glorious stuff that they have. If you have the chance to visit this unique and superb country, do not hesitate, go for it, because you will most likely find a place that you would want to one day call &ldquo;home&rdquo;.</p><h2 id="heading-67vpp" title="ID: heading-67vpp" data-guid="4710e14b-8e78-487c-b909-6171b33dfb6b">Essay about China</h2><p>Essay about China este un eseu care ne prezintă detalii despre una dintre cele mai populate țări din lume, China. Desi majoritatea oamenilor știu cele trei cuvinte clasice &bdquo;Made in China&rdquo;, Essay about China este aici să ne prezinte câteva dintre evenimentele petrecute în această țară, precum și personalități din istoria Chinei, pentru a ne ajuta să vedem dincolo de etichetă. Citește Essay about China pentru a avea un exemplu de nota 10, care te va ajuta să impresionezi orice profesor de engleză.</p><h3 id="heading-87urc" title="ID: heading-87urc">Essay</h3><p>What&rsquo;s the most spoken language on the planet? Internationally, it&rsquo;s English, but at a native level it&rsquo;s Chinese. Being the most heavily populated state in the entire world, that comes as no surprise. China has a long and abundant history, followed by a tragic downfall during the days of Mao Zedong&rsquo;s rule over the country. Nowadays, it has gained the potential to become a superpower in international affairs, but they mostly get mocked for the cheap products labelled &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo;.</p><p>Unofficially, the first dynasty to rule over China was the Xia. But why unofficially? Because archaeologists thought of the Xia Dynasty to be only legend until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites somewhere in the past century. But even then, there was still a clear lack of evidence that could link the findings to either the Xia or some other culture that was around at the time. That&rsquo;s why this first dynasty&rsquo;s rule remains somewhat of a myth. So, officially, the Shang Dynasty is the first to ever rule China, as attested by contemporary records.</p><p>As you can see, the Chinese have history far beyond our reach, which makes them an intriguing group of people. China is also home to one of the most renowned philosophers in the entire world, Confucius, who lived between 551 and 479 BC. Although beginning in ancient times, Confucianism&rsquo;s teachings are still relevant today, as they advocate for meritocracy, self-cultivation and the attainment of skilled judgement rather than the knowledge of rules. Although religious in nature, some argue that at its core, Confucianism is a form of secular thought because of the emphasis on morality rather than spirituality.</p><p>Leaving aside the past, at least partially, what is the most notable tourist attraction in the entire country? It&rsquo;s the Great Wall of China, which some claimed it is visible from space, though that turned out to be an exaggeration, but nevertheless, the wall is still huge and packed with history. The wall was built between 220 and 206 BC in order to protect the Chinese states and empires against Eurasian invaders. Other uses for the wall might sound familiar in the modern era: border control, imposing taxes on traded goods, regulations of free trade and control over immigration and emigration.</p><p>As you clearly see, China has a long history of innovation and culture. Although far too long to be told in such a short time, one can still get an image of how the country used to be and how it is today. Although communism broke their spirit and sent them back technology-wise, the Chinese can still be proud of their past achievements and of their ancestors. They have a lot of traditions that have survived throughout the years and they cherish each one of them as anyone should. Though the country brings up some controversy from time to time, when it comes to trading, China is a good ally who has plenty of resources and cheap labour.</p><h2 id="heading-biaxd" title="ID: heading-biaxd" data-guid="7286ad77-1e48-463d-b755-0514a35bf89a">Essay about Europe</h2><p>Essay about Europe este o lucrare care descrie continentul pe care traim, Europa. Analizând din punctul de vedere al unui turist, Essay about Europe prezintă atât câteva detalii istorice, despre Europa și țările ei, cât și sfaturi pentru orice turist dornic să exploreze continentul. Fie că preferi vacanțele la munte, la mare, vizitele la muzee și diversitatea culturală sau pur și simplu vrei să vezi un loc nou, Essay about Europe te poate ajuta atât cu un sfat cât și cu inspirație pentru următorul test.</p><h3 id="heading-gxtn1" title="ID: heading-gxtn1">Esssay</h3><p>Europe is the continent in which we live. It is a continent that has a rich history, a vast culture, hosts a lot of countries, which makes it probably the most varied continent of them all, and it is home to our own country, Romania.</p><p>Most, if not all, countries in Europe have two major influences when it comes to language: Germanic and Latin or roman. Hence the terms &ldquo;Germanic languages&rdquo; and &ldquo;Romance languages&rdquo;. The European landscape has changed a lot throughout history, as it saw the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the cruel, bloody, Dark Ages, the Renaissance, industrialization and two world wars, for which the continent was the main battleground. Nowadays, Europe is mostly prosperous and appreciated in all industry domains.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not from Europe and you want to visit but have no idea which country to pick, do not worry, for there are a lot of countries worth visiting for many different reasons. If you&rsquo;re the type who likes cold weather and beautiful mountain views, you might consider going to the northern part of Europe, the Scandinavian countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, Finland or Norway. You will also find beautiful mountains in France, Russia, Germany and Romania. If you&rsquo;re the type who likes the big city life, you might consider going to the capitals of any country located on this continent. My personal favourites are Prague from the Czech Republic, Amsterdam from The Netherlands, Paris from France and Vienna from Austria.</p><p>If you want to go to the beach, there are several to be found in Italy and Spain, where the weather during the summer is perfect just for that. The Mediterranean Sea is absolutely gorgeous once you see it in person. Also worth noting is Portugal, as the west and south sides of the country face towards the Atlantic Ocean. If your budget is tight you may also consider Greece, which features huge price drops, or Romania and Bulgaria, which are both known for their low prices and excellent view of the Black Sea. Of course, those aren&rsquo;t the only reasons you should visit this continent.</p><p>As stated near the beginning, Europe is known for its culture. You will find lots of museums, sculptures, paintings, libraries and festivals which will surely be of some interest to you. Getting from one country to another is also fairly easy, as most of the states are in the Schengen Area, so there are no borders between them, but even if you have to pass a border, the patrol isn&rsquo;t usually too strict and if your passport is in order, passing by shouldn&rsquo;t be a major obstacle. Whatever your interests might be, visiting Europe is a guarantee that you will find something attractive. The key word that describes this continent is diversity. In no other continent will you find countries with such vast differences and cultures. Make sure your next vacation will be a European one.</p><h2 id="heading-z4rx9" title="ID: heading-z4rx9" data-guid="5027ba2a-d148-45ff-8453-651663f9d318"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about immigration in the United States</span></h2><p><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about immigration in the United States este o lucrare care pune în lumină una dintre problemele cele mai dezbătute pe teritoriul Statelor Unite, imigrația. Deși este o problemă mai puțin întâlnită și discutată pe teritoriul României, Essay about immigration in the United States ne prezintă problema, așa cum este ea pentru Americani aducând în discuție atât avantajele și dezavantajele imigrației, trasând o linie foarte clară între migrația legală și ilegală, dar și a clauzelor care justifică aceste acțiuni.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-hxypc" title="ID: heading-hxypc"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay</span></h3><p>Immigration represents one of the biggest issues in the US today. The country has been moulded by immigrants ever since its inception, but the times and the context of immigration have changed a lot since the beginning.</p><p>Some Americans believe that immigrants should be welcome inside the country, no matter their legal status, while others are frightened at the sight of what happened in Europe since mass immigration started. Some might consider the need of a passport or green card as oppressive, while others view it as a means of keeping the nation secured. Having a few immigrants here and there, who are registered and come to the US for work isn&rsquo;t a big deal, but massive immigration can represent a huge problem, as most of the illegal immigrants come for welfare checks, which are paid for by the citizens of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, illegal immigration also represents a huge cost for the American people, simply because whenever the government detects an undocumented person and deports them, they do it by using public money, AKA the money gathered from taxes paid by citizens. To be fair, there are people who want to migrate to the US to escape from poverty, war zones and other horrible situations. We all know that getting a visa for this country can be very hard, so in some cases, it is forgivable, at least in my opinion, to try to immigrate no matter what. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning the cases when immigration is done through legal means, because those situations offer advantages both to the country&rsquo;s citizens and to the immigrant at hand.</p><p>Educated people who immigrate through legal means have the potential of making the country and themselves richer. It is far better for everyone to give preferential passage to this type of individuals rather than those who come for the minimum wage jobs. Some people may consider this statement as racist, but I don&rsquo;t think education is limited to only a few ethnic groups. I think everyone can evolve with a little work, it&rsquo;s important to make people understand that this is an important aspect of life and they should consider this when pursuing a career, no matter what country they&rsquo;re targeting.</p><p>Although heavily influenced by bureaucracy in this regard, the US does offer certain programs which make working and traveling to the country much easier. One of these programs, which I&rsquo;ve heard of, is suggestively titled &ldquo;work &amp; travel&rdquo; and it offers university students the opportunity of spending their summer in a city of their choosing with the goal of working, so that they gain experience, and also traveling throughout the country. I know a few people who have applied successfully and rather easily for this program and I intend to do so myself when I&rsquo;m going to be at university.&nbsp;</p><p>From their stories, I have gathered that Americans are nice people and that they too have their problems, just like us. Even though they don&rsquo;t usually have good opinions about immigrants, I can somewhat sympathize with them, especially when I think about how big of a problem mass immigration has become in Europe in the past years.</p><h2 id="heading-xtdzk" title="ID: heading-xtdzk" data-guid="cc6590c3-a2aa-481b-bbb1-4b9267490d23">Essay about Australia</h2><p>Essay about Australia este un eseu care îți prezintă ideile scriitorului asupra țării menționate în titlu. Eseul despre Australia redactat pentru ora de limba engleză îți va servi drept exemplu atunci când vei dori să redactezi propriul tău material.</p><h3 id="heading-zkffy" title="ID: heading-zkffy">Essay</h3><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Australia has the unique distinction of being both a continent and a country at the same time. Although it&rsquo;s the smallest continent of them all, when it comes to country size, it&rsquo;s the sixth largest on the planet. Although big enough to fit a large portion of the Earth&rsquo;s population, very few of its coastal areas receive enough rainfall to support such an endeavour, thus it is quite thinly populated as a result of this condition.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">The largest group of Australian people live in two large cities, Sydney and Melbourne. The vast interior is mainly desert or grassland and there are very few settlements. As a whole, the country has a density of six people per square mile. This does however offer them such advantages as having vast landscapes, bright sunshine throughout the year and a large number of unusual animals that can be found nowhere else, such as kangaroos, platypuses, koalas and other breeds of marsupials.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">But when it comes to wildlife, Australia also has some of the most dangerous creatures imaginable. All sorts of venomous snakes, huge spiders and crocodiles and other frightening creatures live inside the outback. You might remember Steve Irwin, who hosted a show called &ldquo;Crocodile Hunter&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;ve seen any of his episodes, you&rsquo;ve got a good idea of what creatures lie in this country. You might have also noticed that their flag has a miniature British flag in the upper left corner.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Australia was originally formed as a prison colony by the UK in the late 1700s, so most of the people are now of English descent, while aboriginals barely represent 1% of the populace. This explains why their flag was designed the way it is. They also borrowed some other aspects from the British, including driving on the left side of the road, drinking tea and having English as their official language. Even so, the Australian English has lots of differences when compared to British English.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">The British immigrant who came to this continent needed new words to describe the many new, never before seen, plants and animals, so they felt free to borrow a few words from the Aborigines, such as &ldquo;kangaroo&rdquo; and &ldquo;koala&rdquo;. Pioneer settlers in the Australian interior also invented a large and different vocabulary. Ranches became known as stations, wild horses as brundies, and bucking broncos as buckjumpers.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Australians are also well known for their enjoyment of outdoor sports. Most popular are sky diving, surfing, swimming, boating, golf and tennis. You can clearly see a preference for water related sports, as the land is surrounded by water.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">There are a lot more things to say about this country, but it would take a lot of time to go into too much detail. It&rsquo;s a shame that it&rsquo;s so far away from any other country out there and that the only means of travelling there is by plane. Otherwise, a visit to Australia is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to explore this vast and diverse planet.</span></p><h2 id="heading-420b0" title="ID: heading-420b0" data-guid="f958d989-abf4-4e54-9f95-882729980406">Essay about Korea</h2><p>Essay about Korea este o lucrare care ne învață câteva lucruri despre una dintre cele mai controversate zone, Coreea. Fiind o zonă ocupată de doua state complet diferite, Essay about Korea scoate în evidență contrastul extrem dintre Republica Populară Democrată Coreeană și Republica Coreea.</p><h3 id="heading-wwt57" title="ID: heading-wwt57">Essay</h3><p>Korea is a region and historical state in north-eastern Asia, which has been separated into two sovereign states since the year 1945. These two states are suggestively named North Korea and South Korea, though their official names are &ldquo;The Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic&rdquo; for the north and &ldquo;The Republic of Korea&rdquo; in the south.</p><p>The two stated are separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone. As you may know, North Korea is under heavy dictatorship, currently being held by Kim Jong Un. Any and all attempts to flee over to the south through this DMZ will be met with extreme force and possible life imprisonment. The two countries are very different, some would argue that they are exact opposites, which is quite intriguing when you think about the fact that they were once a single state.</p><p>But how did this division occur? Why is the north under a total communist regime, while the south takes joy in the free market that capitalism has to offer? It began after World War II, after the Japanese surrendered. Both superpowers &ndash; the US and the Soviet Union &ndash; gained control of the peninsula. Both super-states had extremely different views about economics, politics and state management, thus they could not come to an agreement. This brought the Korean War in 1950, with the two states fighting for supreme power, but none of them won and the tensions of that war still live today. The animosity between the two is high, even if there is no more official war.</p><p>One might wonder just how different are these two states. North Korea is under a totalitarian regime, as stated above. Although they do have &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; elections, only one candidate is ever present on the ballot, and electing them is imposed by law. Free speech and free thought are an alien thing in that place, as people are indoctrinated since birth that their leader and the ones before are gods who graciously give them all that they need. Suffice to say that all leaders from the inception of the NK and until now suffered from what is labelled as &ldquo;cult of personality&rdquo; in popular terms.</p><p>On the other hand, South Korea is as liberal as any state can get when it comes to economics. If you look at pictures of the Korean peninsula at night, you will see that the south is heavily illuminated, while the north is kept in darkness. The markets are booming in the south and the country&rsquo;s favourite pastime seems to be online video games, as South Korea has been ranked number one for years on end at Starcraft, League of Legends and Dota. The country can also receive credit for being the place in which the most popular Youtube video of all time was created &ndash; Psy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gangnam Style&rdquo; song, which heavily criticizes and parodies the people from the wealthiest district in Seoul, the capital of South Korea.</p><p>As you can see, the countries are basically polar opposites. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone can find something similar between them, apart from the fact that they&rsquo;re on the same peninsula and continent, no matter how hard they&rsquo;d try. This just goes to show you how much government and economics affect our day to day lives and how important liberty is.</p><h2 id="heading-1tyj0" title="ID: heading-1tyj0" data-guid="8a21505d-4727-4185-8d63-3e7270d81945">Essay on Multicultural Britain&nbsp;</h2><p>"We celebrate the diversity in our country, get strength from the cultures and the races that go to make up Britain today." <span style="color:#003366;"><i>Prime Minister Tony Blair, 2 October 2001</i></span></p><p>There is much talk about multicultural societies now a days and Britain is a good country to look at if you want to know how these things works. In Britain people of different cultures live side by side. They have their own religion with churches, mosques, and so on all supported by the government to help the growth of multiculturalism.</p><p>And the immigrants have helped Britain in many ways making the kingdom better and stronger. Combining knowledge from different cultures has changed Britain to the country it is today.</p><p>And it is now sort of a brand for Britain that there is a lot of different people living there and believe it or not, they earn a lot of money on that brand, big companies settle in London to get the best from all cultures in their company, and they are able to get that in the cultural melting pot that is Britain.</p><p>But around Britain there is a concern, after the bombings of the London subway, people have lost trust in one another and a new movement is going on in Britain. They call them selves neo-fascists, some would call them racists. They believe that stopping the constant flow of immigrants to Britain will lower the crime rates, raise the state budget and make Britain a much wealthier and prouder nation.</p><p>But of course it is not all British people who feel this way a lot of people still thinks that immigration is a good idea for example the ex foreign secretary Robyn Cook who believe that immigration is what saved Britain and what is still running it and is what Britain needs to stay at the top in the years to come.</p><p>Unfortunately because of the financial crisis people are only thinking of them selves and not on the wellbeing of their country in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>They just made a law that looks a lot like the Australian immigration law, it is a point based system which divides people into five tiers the tiers are divided after education so if you are for example an engineer your in tier one if you are a fruit picker you are in tier five and so on, this has been made so that it is easier to control the amount of immigrants that comes from beyond Europe so that Britain only get the workers they need and the workers that can make Britain a better place to live and avoid the people who just want to exploit the British welfare system.</p><p>Until Brexit, the immigration to Britain from within Europe could not be controlled in the same way because of the Schengen-treaty that opens the borders within Europe.</p><p>The thing about multiculturalism is that it like everything else have good and bad sides, on the bad side it is not good thing to a society to get a lot of people who exploit the wealth of the country. But on the other hand it is nice to mix it up a little get a fresh face to look at a problem or maybe get a new view on things by talking to people of other cultures or believes. Right now the Brits are torn between tolerance or nationalism which side will win no one knows but I know who I will root for.</p><h2 id="heading-g2vcu" title="ID: heading-g2vcu" data-guid="9717d030-dc4f-473b-aab8-b11753827321">America as a multicultural country</h2><p>The first Chinese immigrants arrived with boat in 1820. &nbsp;Most of the immigrants were low educational males with bad jobs, such as mining and laborer. A big part of the first immigrants came from the Guangdong province and they all wanted a new start. &nbsp;The Chinese Americans was growing rapidly and already in 1852 there was over 25&nbsp;000 immigrants living in America. One of the greatest reasons for this was the big gold rush in 1848. More and more Chinese left their home country and in 1880 the number of Chinese immigrants was as high as 105&nbsp;000, but there were more to come. In 1885 the US government, with Grover Cleveland as president, banned the Chinese from immigrating. The Chinese immigration was heavily restricted until Lynden B. Johnson gave the Chinese a thumb up in 1965.</p><p>During the 1970 the Chinese immigration to America began for full, but most of the Chinese who moved came from Chinas capitol, Hong Kong. Although America had become a civilized country the immigration continued, and today Chinese is the third most speaking language in America.</p><p>But how do they keep there culture? One of the biggest reasons I think is Chinatown. Chinatown is a city district where everything is Chinese. I have been in Chinatown in New York and in San Francisco, and when you walk through the Chinatown gate it&rsquo;s almost like walking into another country. Kilometers with Chinese stores, restaurants and markets make Chinatown a perfect place for Chinese Americans and tourists. Today the district has around 300&nbsp;000 habitants and still growing. Another way of keeping the Chinese culture is the festivals the Chinese Americans always arrange. The biggest and most popular is the New Year celebration, Chinese culture and art festival in Seattle, the dragon Boat festival and the mid-autumn festival.</p><p>Another ethnic group in America is Cuban Americans. If you want to be a Cuban American witch I doubt you want, you need to have Cuban parents. When the first Cubans came to America most of them settled in Florida, Miami and West New York and tried to start a new life. Most of them left Cuba because of the government with Fidel Castro as leader.</p><p>Fidel Castro was a communist and a dictator, but believe it or not in the beginning of his &ldquo;New Cuba&rdquo; he admired America, but after talking to Vice-president Richard Nixon and almost getting killed by the CSA several times, he changed his thoughts about America. Fidel Castro instead built a friendship to the communistic country Russia. At that time in Cuba there was no freedom of speech and Castro is believed to have his own secret police force.</p><p>I think the situation in Cuba is almost the only reason some of the Cubans moved to America. I think the Cubans in difference to the Chinese didn&rsquo;t care that much about the gold rush and all that, but fled for their life.&nbsp;</p><p>To sum up both the Chinese and the Cubans has adapted quite well into the American society. Both of them has places they meet up with other from their country, especially the Chinese witch has Chinatown. America is because of these two and many other countries the world&rsquo;s most multicultural country and therefore America is rich of different culture and traditions.</p><h2 id="heading-qcfr8" title="ID: heading-qcfr8" data-guid="d62539b9-b689-4ffc-99e5-d212ce83d9b2">Essay about New York</h2><p>Essay about New York este structurat astfel încât să îl poți folosi ca sursă de inspirație atunci când ai de redactat un eseu pentru limba engleză. Argumentele despre tema din titlu au fost create de autorul nostru astfel încât să fie accesibile elevilor de liceu, indiferent de clasă sau nivel</p><h3 id="heading-jo9cw" title="ID: heading-jo9cw">Essay</h3><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard lots of songs about this city. You&rsquo;re even more likely to hear about it on the news or on your favorite TV shows and movies from time to time. I remember first hearing about The Big Apple in Spider-Man cartoons. To my childish 6 year old mind, I thought it was just a fictional city, like Gotham from Batman or Metropolis from Superman&rsquo;s comics, but no, it was actually a real city located in the US.</p><p>New York is the most populated area in the entire Northern American region. Suffice to say, you will find lots of tourist attractions and things to do within this huge city. Who hasn&rsquo;t heard of the Statue of Liberty? Or who wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to visit the Twin Towers when they were still standing? Who doesn&rsquo;t want to take a stroll through the huge Central Park? Who wouldn&rsquo;t like going to a concert or any sort of packed event held at Madison Square Garden or celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Eve in Times Square? It&rsquo;s safe to assume that any person you will ever meet wants to visit New York at least once in their lifetime.</p><p>Living in New York, on the other hand, is not as fabulous as one might think. Sure, the streets are well organised, so you will have a chance of learning all the routes fairly easy, but as you can imagine, with such dense population comes great traffic and generally the streets can be very crowded. Decent hotels and rents aren&rsquo;t cheap either, and the ones who are cheap tend to be very sleazy and unpleasant. But on the bright side, living in the Big Apple will present you a lot of career and educational opportunities, though you will have to get through all the competition that such a populated area offers.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not a United States citizen, travelling to New York or going to live there might prove a difficult task, as you will need certain documents before you can set foot in the country. However, there are a few work &amp; travel programs that can handle this mess, assuming you&rsquo;re going there both for work and leisure, and not just for touring the city. Otherwise, you will have to get the necessary documents and visas elsewhere. But if you succeed somehow, the truly big city life awaits you.</p><p>As far as climate goes, New York is influenced by two major climate types: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold dry one from the northwest. Depending on which part of the city you visit, it might get just a little too cold during the winter, but on the plus side, summers are relatively cool so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with any massive heat wave. As far as the economy goes, New York is the leading financial center of the world. With places such as Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Tech Valley and flourishing tourism and events it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see why.</p><p>So do yourself a favour and visit the Big Apple at least once in your life. Getting there might not be easy, but you&rsquo;ll most probably feel satisfied when doing so. After all, it didn&rsquo;t get so famous by just being another ordinary town with nothing to see and do. Make sure to visit all the landmarks and share your stories from your travels with friends and family.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay/education" title="Essay about education" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about education</span></a><a href="/essay/famous-person" title="Essay about a famous person | Nelson Mandela, J.K.Rowling, Bill Gates" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about a famous person</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

De la orașe dens populate și decorate cu zgârie-nori până la cultura din satele liniștite, Eseul ne descrie atât frumusețea tradiționalistă a japoniei, cât și obiceiurile stricte urmate de oameni în această țară. În Japonia se spune că făra profesori nu ar exista conducători, așa că citeștee Essay about Japan pentru a-ți onora profesorul cu o compunere bine scrisă, iar acesta te va onora cu o notă de 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-vp5m2\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-vp5m2\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso known as \u0026ldquo;The Land of the Rising Sun\u0026rdquo;, Japan is a unique and intriguing country situated on the most eastern part of Asia. You will find that the country has a rich history, a vast culture and beautiful landscapes. Be it immense cities with skyscrapers and shining lights or a quiet village with lots of spectacular flowers, you will find what you are looking for in Japan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople who live in this country tend to pay a lot of attention to details, manners and hard work. The school system is renowned for being harsh and rewarding those who do their best. They take immense pride in their family name and honour, so dropping out of school is considered extremely disrespectful to one\u0026rsquo;s ancestors. Education is taken so seriously that the only people who are not required to bow down before the emperor are teachers, because they think that without educators there would be no rulers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, they value manners, which also stem from education. Go into any given store, bank or other business and you shall be greeted not by one, but by every staff member that is present. This automatically makes you feel as if you are a welcomed guest, but I imagine it can get fairly annoying for people to have to do this every day with every customer that arrives or departs. Nevertheless, it is a sign of respect and it should be appreciated as such. They also have strict policies when entering someone\u0026rsquo;s home, when accepting a gift, when waiting in line for the bus or train and for all other sorts of activities. As well-intended as they may be, one has to question how stressful all this strictness is to a human.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomically speaking, Japan is well known for its stable economy and availability for work positions as long as you\u0026rsquo;ve got the necessary skills. Competition is harsh in the better paying job market due to the high education rate of the country, but usually not too many people get left behind because of the ever increasing number of businesses. But with an immense population and money being so numerous comes inflation. Prices aren\u0026rsquo;t great in crowded cities such as Tokyo, especially when it comes to renting an apartment. But the Japanese have seemingly found a solution for this as well, because a lot of them opt for a subscription to an internet coffee shop where they spend days and nights searching for jobs in their ever growing market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI almost forgot to mention their extraordinary cuisine. Japan is renowned for their sushi, which has garnered popularity all around the globe. Their cuisine has arguably become an exotic delicacy and a gourmand\u0026rsquo;s number one choice every so often. You don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re missing until you have not tried it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuffice to say that each country has its fair share of good and bad things, but Japan has a talent of making all the imperfect aspects fade away when compared to all the glorious stuff that they have. If you have the chance to visit this unique and superb country, do not hesitate, go for it, because you will most likely find a place that you would want to one day call \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-67vpp\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-67vpp\u0022 data-guid=\u00224710e14b-8e78-487c-b909-6171b33dfb6b\u0022\u003eEssay about China\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about China este un eseu care ne prezintă detalii despre una dintre cele mai populate țări din lume, China. Desi majoritatea oamenilor știu cele trei cuvinte clasice \u0026bdquo;Made in China\u0026rdquo;, Essay about China este aici să ne prezinte câteva dintre evenimentele petrecute în această țară, precum și personalități din istoria Chinei, pentru a ne ajuta să vedem dincolo de etichetă. Citește Essay about China pentru a avea un exemplu de nota 10, care te va ajuta să impresionezi orice profesor de engleză.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-87urc\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-87urc\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s the most spoken language on the planet? Internationally, it\u0026rsquo;s English, but at a native level it\u0026rsquo;s Chinese. Being the most heavily populated state in the entire world, that comes as no surprise. China has a long and abundant history, followed by a tragic downfall during the days of Mao Zedong\u0026rsquo;s rule over the country. Nowadays, it has gained the potential to become a superpower in international affairs, but they mostly get mocked for the cheap products labelled \u0026ldquo;Made in China\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnofficially, the first dynasty to rule over China was the Xia. But why unofficially? Because archaeologists thought of the Xia Dynasty to be only legend until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites somewhere in the past century. But even then, there was still a clear lack of evidence that could link the findings to either the Xia or some other culture that was around at the time. That\u0026rsquo;s why this first dynasty\u0026rsquo;s rule remains somewhat of a myth. So, officially, the Shang Dynasty is the first to ever rule China, as attested by contemporary records.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, the Chinese have history far beyond our reach, which makes them an intriguing group of people. China is also home to one of the most renowned philosophers in the entire world, Confucius, who lived between 551 and 479 BC. Although beginning in ancient times, Confucianism\u0026rsquo;s teachings are still relevant today, as they advocate for meritocracy, self-cultivation and the attainment of skilled judgement rather than the knowledge of rules. Although religious in nature, some argue that at its core, Confucianism is a form of secular thought because of the emphasis on morality rather than spirituality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeaving aside the past, at least partially, what is the most notable tourist attraction in the entire country? It\u0026rsquo;s the Great Wall of China, which some claimed it is visible from space, though that turned out to be an exaggeration, but nevertheless, the wall is still huge and packed with history. The wall was built between 220 and 206 BC in order to protect the Chinese states and empires against Eurasian invaders. Other uses for the wall might sound familiar in the modern era: border control, imposing taxes on traded goods, regulations of free trade and control over immigration and emigration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you clearly see, China has a long history of innovation and culture. Although far too long to be told in such a short time, one can still get an image of how the country used to be and how it is today. Although communism broke their spirit and sent them back technology-wise, the Chinese can still be proud of their past achievements and of their ancestors. They have a lot of traditions that have survived throughout the years and they cherish each one of them as anyone should. Though the country brings up some controversy from time to time, when it comes to trading, China is a good ally who has plenty of resources and cheap labour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-biaxd\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-biaxd\u0022 data-guid=\u00227286ad77-1e48-463d-b755-0514a35bf89a\u0022\u003eEssay about Europe\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about Europe este o lucrare care descrie continentul pe care traim, Europa. Analizând din punctul de vedere al unui turist, Essay about Europe prezintă atât câteva detalii istorice, despre Europa și țările ei, cât și sfaturi pentru orice turist dornic să exploreze continentul. Fie că preferi vacanțele la munte, la mare, vizitele la muzee și diversitatea culturală sau pur și simplu vrei să vezi un loc nou, Essay about Europe te poate ajuta atât cu un sfat cât și cu inspirație pentru următorul test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-gxtn1\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-gxtn1\u0022\u003eEsssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEurope is the continent in which we live. It is a continent that has a rich history, a vast culture, hosts a lot of countries, which makes it probably the most varied continent of them all, and it is home to our own country, Romania.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost, if not all, countries in Europe have two major influences when it comes to language: Germanic and Latin or roman. Hence the terms \u0026ldquo;Germanic languages\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Romance languages\u0026rdquo;. The European landscape has changed a lot throughout history, as it saw the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the cruel, bloody, Dark Ages, the Renaissance, industrialization and two world wars, for which the continent was the main battleground. Nowadays, Europe is mostly prosperous and appreciated in all industry domains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not from Europe and you want to visit but have no idea which country to pick, do not worry, for there are a lot of countries worth visiting for many different reasons. If you\u0026rsquo;re the type who likes cold weather and beautiful mountain views, you might consider going to the northern part of Europe, the Scandinavian countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, Finland or Norway. You will also find beautiful mountains in France, Russia, Germany and Romania. If you\u0026rsquo;re the type who likes the big city life, you might consider going to the capitals of any country located on this continent. My personal favourites are Prague from the Czech Republic, Amsterdam from The Netherlands, Paris from France and Vienna from Austria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to go to the beach, there are several to be found in Italy and Spain, where the weather during the summer is perfect just for that. The Mediterranean Sea is absolutely gorgeous once you see it in person. Also worth noting is Portugal, as the west and south sides of the country face towards the Atlantic Ocean. If your budget is tight you may also consider Greece, which features huge price drops, or Romania and Bulgaria, which are both known for their low prices and excellent view of the Black Sea. Of course, those aren\u0026rsquo;t the only reasons you should visit this continent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs stated near the beginning, Europe is known for its culture. You will find lots of museums, sculptures, paintings, libraries and festivals which will surely be of some interest to you. Getting from one country to another is also fairly easy, as most of the states are in the Schengen Area, so there are no borders between them, but even if you have to pass a border, the patrol isn\u0026rsquo;t usually too strict and if your passport is in order, passing by shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a major obstacle. Whatever your interests might be, visiting Europe is a guarantee that you will find something attractive. The key word that describes this continent is diversity. In no other continent will you find countries with such vast differences and cultures. Make sure your next vacation will be a European one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-z4rx9\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-z4rx9\u0022 data-guid=\u00225027ba2a-d148-45ff-8453-651663f9d318\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about immigration in the United States\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about immigration in the United States este o lucrare care pune în lumină una dintre problemele cele mai dezbătute pe teritoriul Statelor Unite, imigrația. Deși este o problemă mai puțin întâlnită și discutată pe teritoriul României, Essay about immigration in the United States ne prezintă problema, așa cum este ea pentru Americani aducând în discuție atât avantajele și dezavantajele imigrației, trasând o linie foarte clară între migrația legală și ilegală, dar și a clauzelor care justifică aceste acțiuni.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-hxypc\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-hxypc\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eImmigration represents one of the biggest issues in the US today. The country has been moulded by immigrants ever since its inception, but the times and the context of immigration have changed a lot since the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome Americans believe that immigrants should be welcome inside the country, no matter their legal status, while others are frightened at the sight of what happened in Europe since mass immigration started. Some might consider the need of a passport or green card as oppressive, while others view it as a means of keeping the nation secured. Having a few immigrants here and there, who are registered and come to the US for work isn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal, but massive immigration can represent a huge problem, as most of the illegal immigrants come for welfare checks, which are paid for by the citizens of the United States.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, illegal immigration also represents a huge cost for the American people, simply because whenever the government detects an undocumented person and deports them, they do it by using public money, AKA the money gathered from taxes paid by citizens. To be fair, there are people who want to migrate to the US to escape from poverty, war zones and other horrible situations. We all know that getting a visa for this country can be very hard, so in some cases, it is forgivable, at least in my opinion, to try to immigrate no matter what. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning the cases when immigration is done through legal means, because those situations offer advantages both to the country\u0026rsquo;s citizens and to the immigrant at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEducated people who immigrate through legal means have the potential of making the country and themselves richer. It is far better for everyone to give preferential passage to this type of individuals rather than those who come for the minimum wage jobs. Some people may consider this statement as racist, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think education is limited to only a few ethnic groups. I think everyone can evolve with a little work, it\u0026rsquo;s important to make people understand that this is an important aspect of life and they should consider this when pursuing a career, no matter what country they\u0026rsquo;re targeting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough heavily influenced by bureaucracy in this regard, the US does offer certain programs which make working and traveling to the country much easier. One of these programs, which I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of, is suggestively titled \u0026ldquo;work \u0026amp; travel\u0026rdquo; and it offers university students the opportunity of spending their summer in a city of their choosing with the goal of working, so that they gain experience, and also traveling throughout the country. I know a few people who have applied successfully and rather easily for this program and I intend to do so myself when I\u0026rsquo;m going to be at university.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom their stories, I have gathered that Americans are nice people and that they too have their problems, just like us. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t usually have good opinions about immigrants, I can somewhat sympathize with them, especially when I think about how big of a problem mass immigration has become in Europe in the past years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-xtdzk\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-xtdzk\u0022 data-guid=\u0022cc6590c3-a2aa-481b-bbb1-4b9267490d23\u0022\u003eEssay about Australia\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about Australia este un eseu care îți prezintă ideile scriitorului asupra țării menționate în titlu.

Although it\u0026rsquo;s the smallest continent of them all, when it comes to country size, it\u0026rsquo;s the sixth largest on the planet. Although big enough to fit a large portion of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s population, very few of its coastal areas receive enough rainfall to support such an endeavour, thus it is quite thinly populated as a result of this condition.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eThe largest group of Australian people live in two large cities, Sydney and Melbourne. The vast interior is mainly desert or grassland and there are very few settlements. As a whole, the country has a density of six people per square mile. This does however offer them such advantages as having vast landscapes, bright sunshine throughout the year and a large number of unusual animals that can be found nowhere else, such as kangaroos, platypuses, koalas and other breeds of marsupials.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eBut when it comes to wildlife, Australia also has some of the most dangerous creatures imaginable. All sorts of venomous snakes, huge spiders and crocodiles and other frightening creatures live inside the outback. You might remember Steve Irwin, who hosted a show called \u0026ldquo;Crocodile Hunter\u0026rdquo;. If you\u0026rsquo;ve seen any of his episodes, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a good idea of what creatures lie in this country.

This explains why their flag was designed the way it is. They also borrowed some other aspects from the British, including driving on the left side of the road, drinking tea and having English as their official language. Even so, the Australian English has lots of differences when compared to British English.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eThe British immigrant who came to this continent needed new words to describe the many new, never before seen, plants and animals, so they felt free to borrow a few words from the Aborigines, such as \u0026ldquo;kangaroo\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;koala\u0026rdquo;. Pioneer settlers in the Australian interior also invented a large and different vocabulary. Ranches became known as stations, wild horses as brundies, and bucking broncos as buckjumpers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eAustralians are also well known for their enjoyment of outdoor sports.

These two states are suggestively named North Korea and South Korea, though their official names are \u0026ldquo;The Democratic People\u0026rsquo;s Republic\u0026rdquo; for the north and \u0026ldquo;The Republic of Korea\u0026rdquo; in the south.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two stated are separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone. As you may know, North Korea is under heavy dictatorship, currently being held by Kim Jong Un. Any and all attempts to flee over to the south through this DMZ will be met with extreme force and possible life imprisonment. The two countries are very different, some would argue that they are exact opposites, which is quite intriguing when you think about the fact that they were once a single state.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut how did this division occur? Why is the north under a total communist regime, while the south takes joy in the free market that capitalism has to offer? It began after World War II, after the Japanese surrendered. Both superpowers \u0026ndash; the US and the Soviet Union \u0026ndash; gained control of the peninsula. Both super-states had extremely different views about economics, politics and state management, thus they could not come to an agreement. This brought the Korean War in 1950, with the two states fighting for supreme power, but none of them won and the tensions of that war still live today. The animosity between the two is high, even if there is no more official war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne might wonder just how different are these two states. North Korea is under a totalitarian regime, as stated above. Although they do have \u0026ldquo;democratic\u0026rdquo; elections, only one candidate is ever present on the ballot, and electing them is imposed by law. Free speech and free thought are an alien thing in that place, as people are indoctrinated since birth that their leader and the ones before are gods who graciously give them all that they need. Suffice to say that all leaders from the inception of the NK and until now suffered from what is labelled as \u0026ldquo;cult of personality\u0026rdquo; in popular terms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, South Korea is as liberal as any state can get when it comes to economics. If you look at pictures of the Korean peninsula at night, you will see that the south is heavily illuminated, while the north is kept in darkness. The markets are booming in the south and the country\u0026rsquo;s favourite pastime seems to be online video games, as South Korea has been ranked number one for years on end at Starcraft, League of Legends and Dota. The country can also receive credit for being the place in which the most popular Youtube video of all time was created \u0026ndash; Psy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Gangnam Style\u0026rdquo; song, which heavily criticizes and parodies the people from the wealthiest district in Seoul, the capital of South Korea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, the countries are basically polar opposites. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if anyone can find something similar between them, apart from the fact that they\u0026rsquo;re on the same peninsula and continent, no matter how hard they\u0026rsquo;d try. This just goes to show you how much government and economics affect our day to day lives and how important liberty is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-1tyj0\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-1tyj0\u0022 data-guid=\u00228a21505d-4727-4185-8d63-3e7270d81945\u0022\u003eEssay on Multicultural Britain\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0022We celebrate the diversity in our country, get strength from the cultures and the races that go to make up Britain today.\u0022 \u003cspan style=\u0022color:#003366;\u0022\u003e\u003ci\u003ePrime Minister Tony Blair, 2 October 2001\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is much talk about multicultural societies now a days and Britain is a good country to look at if you want to know how these things works. In Britain people of different cultures live side by side. They have their own religion with churches, mosques, and so on all supported by the government to help the growth of multiculturalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the immigrants have helped Britain in many ways making the kingdom better and stronger. Combining knowledge from different cultures has changed Britain to the country it is today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it is now sort of a brand for Britain that there is a lot of different people living there and believe it or not, they earn a lot of money on that brand, big companies settle in London to get the best from all cultures in their company, and they are able to get that in the cultural melting pot that is Britain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut around Britain there is a concern, after the bombings of the London subway, people have lost trust in one another and a new movement is going on in Britain. They call them selves neo-fascists, some would call them racists. They believe that stopping the constant flow of immigrants to Britain will lower the crime rates, raise the state budget and make Britain a much wealthier and prouder nation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut of course it is not all British people who feel this way a lot of people still thinks that immigration is a good idea for example the ex foreign secretary Robyn Cook who believe that immigration is what saved Britain and what is still running it and is what Britain needs to stay at the top in the years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately because of the financial crisis people are only thinking of them selves and not on the wellbeing of their country in the years to come.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey just made a law that looks a lot like the Australian immigration law, it is a point based system which divides people into five tiers the tiers are divided after education so if you are for example an engineer your in tier one if you are a fruit picker you are in tier five and so on, this has been made so that it is easier to control the amount of immigrants that comes from beyond Europe so that Britain only get the workers they need and the workers that can make Britain a better place to live and avoid the people who just want to exploit the British welfare system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUntil Brexit, the immigration to Britain from within Europe could not be controlled in the same way because of the Schengen-treaty that opens the borders within Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing about multiculturalism is that it like everything else have good and bad sides, on the bad side it is not good thing to a society to get a lot of people who exploit the wealth of the country. But on the other hand it is nice to mix it up a little get a fresh face to look at a problem or maybe get a new view on things by talking to people of other cultures or believes. Right now the Brits are torn between tolerance or nationalism which side will win no one knows but I know who I will root for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-g2vcu\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-g2vcu\u0022 data-guid=\u00229717d030-dc4f-473b-aab8-b11753827321\u0022\u003eAmerica as a multicultural country\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first Chinese immigrants arrived with boat in 1820. \u0026nbsp;Most of the immigrants were low educational males with bad jobs, such as mining and laborer. A big part of the first immigrants came from the Guangdong province and they all wanted a new start. \u0026nbsp;The Chinese Americans was growing rapidly and already in 1852 there was over 25\u0026nbsp;000 immigrants living in America. One of the greatest reasons for this was the big gold rush in 1848. More and more Chinese left their home country and in 1880 the number of Chinese immigrants was as high as 105\u0026nbsp;000, but there were more to come. In 1885 the US government, with Grover Cleveland as president, banned the Chinese from immigrating. The Chinese immigration was heavily restricted until Lynden B. Johnson gave the Chinese a thumb up in 1965.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the 1970 the Chinese immigration to America began for full, but most of the Chinese who moved came from Chinas capitol, Hong Kong. Although America had become a civilized country the immigration continued, and today Chinese is the third most speaking language in America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut how do they keep there culture? One of the biggest reasons I think is Chinatown. Chinatown is a city district where everything is Chinese. I have been in Chinatown in New York and in San Francisco, and when you walk through the Chinatown gate it\u0026rsquo;s almost like walking into another country. Kilometers with Chinese stores, restaurants and markets make Chinatown a perfect place for Chinese Americans and tourists. Today the district has around 300\u0026nbsp;000 habitants and still growing. Another way of keeping the Chinese culture is the festivals the Chinese Americans always arrange. The biggest and most popular is the New Year celebration, Chinese culture and art festival in Seattle, the dragon Boat festival and the mid-autumn festival.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother ethnic group in America is Cuban Americans. If you want to be a Cuban American witch I doubt you want, you need to have Cuban parents. When the first Cubans came to America most of them settled in Florida, Miami and West New York and tried to start a new life. Most of them left Cuba because of the government with Fidel Castro as leader.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFidel Castro was a communist and a dictator, but believe it or not in the beginning of his \u0026ldquo;New Cuba\u0026rdquo; he admired America, but after talking to Vice-president Richard Nixon and almost getting killed by the CSA several times, he changed his thoughts about America. Fidel Castro instead built a friendship to the communistic country Russia. At that time in Cuba there was no freedom of speech and Castro is believed to have his own secret police force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the situation in Cuba is almost the only reason some of the Cubans moved to America. I think the Cubans in difference to the Chinese didn\u0026rsquo;t care that much about the gold rush and all that, but fled for their life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo sum up both the Chinese and the Cubans has adapted quite well into the American society. Both of them has places they meet up with other from their country, especially the Chinese witch has Chinatown. America is because of these two and many other countries the world\u0026rsquo;s most multicultural country and therefore America is rich of different culture and traditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-qcfr8\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-qcfr8\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d62539b9-b689-4ffc-99e5-d212ce83d9b2\u0022\u003eEssay about New York\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about New York este structurat astfel încât să îl poți folosi ca sursă de inspirație atunci când ai de redactat un eseu pentru limba engleză.

You\u0026rsquo;re even more likely to hear about it on the news or on your favorite TV shows and movies from time to time. I remember first hearing about The Big Apple in Spider-Man cartoons. To my childish 6 year old mind, I thought it was just a fictional city, like Gotham from Batman or Metropolis from Superman\u0026rsquo;s comics, but no, it was actually a real city located in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York is the most populated area in the entire Northern American region. Suffice to say, you will find lots of tourist attractions and things to do within this huge city. Who hasn\u0026rsquo;t heard of the Statue of Liberty? Or who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have wanted to visit the Twin Towers when they were still standing? Who doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to take a stroll through the huge Central Park? Who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like going to a concert or any sort of packed event held at Madison Square Garden or celebrate New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve in Times Square? It\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that any person you will ever meet wants to visit New York at least once in their lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiving in New York, on the other hand, is not as fabulous as one might think. Sure, the streets are well organised, so you will have a chance of learning all the routes fairly easy, but as you can imagine, with such dense population comes great traffic and generally the streets can be very crowded. Decent hotels and rents aren\u0026rsquo;t cheap either, and the ones who are cheap tend to be very sleazy and unpleasant. But on the bright side, living in the Big Apple will present you a lot of career and educational opportunities, though you will have to get through all the competition that such a populated area offers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not a United States citizen, travelling to New York or going to live there might prove a difficult task, as you will need certain documents before you can set foot in the country. However, there are a few work \u0026amp; travel programs that can handle this mess, assuming you\u0026rsquo;re going there both for work and leisure, and not just for touring the city. Otherwise, you will have to get the necessary documents and visas elsewhere. But if you succeed somehow, the truly big city life awaits you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs far as climate goes, New York is influenced by two major climate types: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold dry one from the northwest. Depending on which part of the city you visit, it might get just a little too cold during the winter, but on the plus side, summers are relatively cool so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with any massive heat wave. As far as the economy goes, New York is the leading financial center of the world. With places such as Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Tech Valley and flourishing tourism and events it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to see why.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo do yourself a favour and visit the Big Apple at least once in your life. Getting there might not be easy, but you\u0026rsquo;ll most probably feel satisfied when doing so. After all, it didn\u0026rsquo;t get so famous by just being another ordinary town with nothing to see and do.
