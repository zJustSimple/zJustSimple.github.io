Deși știm cu toții că este greșit să judeci pe cineva după prima impresie, Essay about how the first impression can be misleading ne arată ca această atitudine este folosită mai des decât am vrea să recunoaștem, dând mai multă importanță felului în care ne prezentăm, dar în același timp dând naștere unor atitudini și prejudicii care de cele mai multe ori nu sunt deloc binevenite. Citește Essay about how the first impression can be misleading pentru a da o bună impresie la următorul examen, și a prinde nota mult așteptată.</p><h3 id="heading-hxv0f" title="ID: heading-hxv0f">Essay</h3><p>We know that judging others is wrong sometimes, especially when the assumptions we make are based on things that we know very little of. There&rsquo;s no doubt that first impressions matter quite a lot in any given situation, but they can also be very misleading. Not everything is as it seems, especially beings as complex as humans are.</p><p>As hypocritical as it may be to judge someone based on their looks alone, we have to admit that to a certain degree, we all do it. Even teachers tell us that judging people is bad, but still judge us by the way we dress, for example, on the first day of classes. Judging people is inevitable, as it is part of the very essence of human nature. Sure, you might say that you can get an idea from what a person is like even from the first impression, but it can be very misleading, especially if the person knows how to act accordingly and tell you what you want to hear.</p><p>In theory, observing a person&rsquo;s behaviour, their body language, their tone, their vocabulary and other things can give us a good but possibly misleading first impression. A good speaker may convince you that they&rsquo;re trustworthy, yet when it comes down to sharing important information with them, you might find out that your secrets are now known by everyone in the vicinity. On the flipside, a person who seems shy and introverted at first glance, might actually be a party animal or very talkative given a certain group of individuals and a certain environment.</p><p>Stereotypes are yet another misleading factor when it comes to first impressions. They create a pre-established image in our head about how an individual with certain characteristics might be. For instance, we all know the classic racial stereotypes or the stereotypes about people who listen to different genres of music. We rely too much on labelling people and we tend to forget that we are all human. Every person that you will ever meet is a unique individual. Just because they share certain characteristics within a group doesn&rsquo;t mean that they share all of the attributes of said group.</p><p>The bottom line is that although first impressions matter, it is not wise to judge people based only on that little knowledge that we receive the first time seeing them. You never know what surprises are in store when establishing a connection with someone. Sometimes, they might be exactly as you expected them to be from the start, but most of the time, the reality is far different from the image in our head. We should learn to judge little and observe more, because, after all, only through observation and communication can we truly understand humans.</p><h2 id="heading-hl3ts" title="ID: heading-hl3ts" data-guid="d91ff284-1581-483d-9ad1-fab14cc3cc6a">Essay about an embarrassing moment</h2><p>Essay about an embarrassing moment este o lucrare care empatizează cu fiecare dintre noi, având ca temă, un moment jenant din viața noastră. Fie că este vorba de o situație în care ne-am făcut de rușine, fie că este vorba de o situație în care altcineva ne-am făcut de rușine, eseuș ne arată că avem cu toții momentele noastre neplăcute, încurajându-ne să acceptăm această realitate crudă, și să facem eforturi să trecem peste, cu capul sus și pieptul înainte. Evită grijile și stresul unui moment neplăcut și citește Essay about an embarrassing moment pentru a ieși cu capul sus și cu un 10 la următorul test sau examen.</p><h3 id="heading-8p9as" title="ID: heading-8p9as">Essay</h3><p>I think we have all experienced several embarrassing moments during our lifetime. There are no exceptions, we all have our very own little awkward moments that make life unpleasant. The trick to getting past such moments is to not lose focus and scoff them off or devise a strategy to ensure that we can avoid them as many times as needed.</p><p>Being mostly introverted, I have a huge fear of speaking in public. I&rsquo;d much rather spend a night in a creepy, sleazy motel room than to be forced to partake in the act of public speaking. Regardless, in school we are all forced to do this thing at least a few times a year, when answering the teacher&rsquo;s question or when an oral exam is on its way. For me, the less people there are in the room, the better. Formalities tend to make me feel nervous, especially when a large group is involved.</p><p>Whenever I have to do this type of thing, I tend to stutter, my face turns red and I can barely keep calm. However, I have moved on past most of these moments, because teachers are trained to empathize with emotional people. But there were a few exceptions when the teacher&rsquo;s remarks about my stuttering and lack of ability to focus have made me even more nervous than I was initially. The most embarrassing moment of this type that I can clearly remember occurred when I was in the 5th grade.</p><p>Our entire school held a sermon for Romania&rsquo;s National Day. The children who were good at singing had to perform certain traditional songs from our country, while me and others were practically forced to memorize poems and recite them in front of the entire school yard. Memorizing the poem was not a big issue for me, but when the time came to face my fear of public speaking in front of so many people I trembled. My face turned red and I started stuttering. I recited my poem very quietly while a teacher in the back kept telling me to speak louder.</p><p>I felt so embarrassed that I started to recite the poem as fast as I could just so I would get it over with. Fortunately for me, almost everyone knew that I had stage fright and no one laughed, but I knew, deep down, that they looked at me with pitifulness. I felt so embarrassed that I immediately left school afterwards and avoided coming the next day. To make matters worse, the teacher who instructed me to memorize the poem subtly reminded me of the event every time she got the opportunity. I hated her so much for this.</p><p>Nevertheless, I scoffed it off as if it never happened and I had very good classmates who always tried to encourage me and give me advice about how to lose this stage fright of mine. I think we can all move past embarrassing events if we have the right people by our side. We shouldn&rsquo;t let others make us feel ashamed, for it is in our nature to fail from time to time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-ytl15" title="ID: heading-ytl15" data-guid="01bf1827-93de-4de6-800c-007a890bd9bf">Essay about imagination</h2><p>Essay about imagination este o lucrare ce ne amintește de una dintre cele mai frumoase capabilități ale minții noastre, imaginația. Fiind o abilitate pe care majoritatea o avem încă de când suntem mici, Essay about imagination ne arată puterea, importanța și posibilitățile deschise de această aptitudine ce de multe ori este ignorată sau luată în râs. Citește eseul pentru a-ți întări cunoștințele.</p><h3 id="heading-3c8jb" title="ID: heading-3c8jb">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Imagination is the core of all creativity and knowledge. What would the world be if people wouldn&rsquo;t use their imagination? It would certainly be a lot more boring. Ever since we are children, we use imagination to make up different scenarios, think about the future, come up with ideas and escape reality.</p><p>Imagination cannot be touched, it is unreal, it is all in our head. But it is so good to be able to imagine things, even events of stuff that isn&rsquo;t possible in real life. Just think about all the books, movies and games that were created by people&rsquo;s imagination. Life with be boring without it, that&rsquo;s for certain. The good thing about imagination is that it&rsquo;s not just an escape from reality, but it can also be useful to us. You may want to approach someone regarding the problem. In this case, use your imagination to figure out all the possibilities and plan out the conversation accordingly.</p><p>Of course, the use of imagination also applies into critical thinking problems. You&rsquo;ve probably heard about things on the internet called &ldquo;life hacks&rdquo;. Those are great examples of people using their imagination to make life easier or certain tasks less stressful. Being able to make life easy without sacrificing its complexity is a sign of a healthy imagination. One can also use this power to solve problems that don&rsquo;t necessarily have an obligatory way of being dealt with. There are times in life where you may only see one solution, but try to keep calm and use your imagination and instincts to see if there isn&rsquo;t another way.</p><p>Leaving problems and solutions aside, I cannot imagine how life would have been without my favourite forms of entertainment. I can&rsquo;t imagine how it would have been not reading my favourite books, not watching my favourite movies or playing my favourite video games. These are all products of human imagination that we use daily. If there is a parallel universe where imagination doesn&rsquo;t exist, then I certainly don&rsquo;t want to be part of that world. I&rsquo;d much rather live in this world, with all its flaws than in one that doesn&rsquo;t display any form of imagination.</p><p>I just tried using my imagination to imagine a world without this. I think it&rsquo;s probably the best metaphor for hell that anyone could&rsquo;ve come up with. And it&rsquo;s as ironic as it can be. Using your imagination to imagine a world without this exact same thing is extremely ironic, just thinking about how paradoxical this is makes my head hurt. As a conclusion, this is exactly the magic I was talking about. Through imagination, I just created a paradox. I and many others have created situations that couldn&rsquo;t possibly exist in real life, and that is beautiful. Use your imagination as often as you can, for it is the most powerful tool at mankind&rsquo;s disposal.</p><h2 id="heading-hwgjm" title="ID: heading-hwgjm" data-guid="4d304e74-ab54-40be-8af6-f6e99cf17188">Essay about graffiti</h2><p>Dacă te-ai uitat vreodată pe un perete, neștiind dacă ceea ce vezi este artă sau vandalism, Essay about graffiti poate să-ti clarifice situația. Trasând o linie clară între cele două extreme, Essay about graffiti explică diferențele, și definește condițiile ca un desen pe un perete să poată fi considerat o formă artistică de exprimare, și nu doar o altă vandalizare fară gust. Citește eseul despre graffiti pentru a-ți rafina gusturile în arta stradală.</p><h3 id="heading-q8ehg" title="ID: heading-q8ehg">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Art is an evolutionary act. The shape of art and its role in society is constantly changing. At no point is art static. There are no rules.&rdquo;</p><p>Many people still debate whether graffiti is art or vandalism. I think it can be both. To put it in the simplest way possible, if it looks good, expresses something, takes talent and time to produce but it was done on someone else&rsquo;s property, then it is vandal art. It&rsquo;s that simple. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Not all graffiti is vandalism, for the simple reason that in some cases the owner agrees beforehand that a wall on his property shall be painted by someone else. This is the most preferable way to do graffiti, because it is harmless and affects no one.&nbsp;</p><p>In other cases, it&rsquo;s not art at all, just plain vandalism. I can&rsquo;t remember how many times I&rsquo;ve been through ghettos and seen lots of poorly drawn graffiti, or graffiti that represented simple words with no special &ldquo;font&rdquo;, or drawings that could&rsquo;ve been done by grade schoolers, or even vulgar drawings executed with poor taste. Sadly, these are the examples that make people have such bad opinions about graffiti and that&rsquo;s a shame, because it has the potential to be a new art form.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a shame. Looking at some of the murals that were painted on large buildings in urban areas, with the approval of the owner, and then seeing jerks writing vulgar words on walls just because they can and then having the two compared and be considered the same thing really annoys me. The first example is art, whilst the second is vandalism, no doubt about it. Yet it is these kinds of acts that make people have such a bad opinion about graffiti overall. It&rsquo;s sad because street artists who actually have talent and ethics get compared to vandals.</p><p>Some might argue that the purposes and motivations that drive artists to put up their work in certain public spaces can be summed up as a form of protest. Taking free speech into consideration, one cannot deny another person&rsquo;s right to protest, but even when doing so, you have to be careful not to deny other people&rsquo;s rights. When vandalizing another person&rsquo;s property, that&rsquo;s exactly what you are doing. You are defacing another human being&rsquo;s building without their permission, thus the reason it can no longer be considered free speech.</p><p>I think we can all agree that graffiti does have the potential of becoming a new art form. Some people already consider it just that, hence the preferential terms &ldquo;street art&rdquo; and &ldquo;urban art&rdquo;. Though misunderstood by the majority of the population, graffiti artists can turn around their image by doing what they do best, legally. It is up to them and to other art lovers to help promote this movement and shed light on what it actually is, so that the negative image people have will eventually disappear.</p><h2 id="heading-xf2t0" title="ID: heading-xf2t0" data-guid="bf7f40b4-e642-4acf-904a-cfaa28fa8833">Essay about journalism</h2><p>Fie că vorbim despre știri, ziare sau articole, Essay about journalism le pune pe toate într-o singură categorie. Deși nu este una dintre cele mai bine văzute profesii, eseul despre jurnalism încearcă să dea la o parte stigmatizarea adusă jurnalismului, arătând adevăratele valori și merite ale acestei meserii cu rădăcini nobile. Eseul scoate în evidență greutățile și provocările meseriei, fiind un material excelent pentru oricine dorește să scrie un eseu care să impresioneze cititorul, și să ridice rating-ul lucrării la 100%.</p><h3 id="heading-td6tz" title="ID: heading-td6tz">Esssay</h3><p>&ldquo;All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone's feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>Journalists tend to get a lot of hate from people, sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad reasons. Although tabloids have infested our society with unnecessary news about some celebrity&rsquo;s haircut, we have to respect the reporters and newspaper writers who strive to give out important information to the public.</p><p>Journalism involves ethics, morality and devotement. Although certain outlets and shady news site do not respect these principles, we cannot condemn the jobs of journalists as a whole. The freedom of expression was fought for exactly so that we could be free to read, write and say anything we wanted. The first principle of journalism is to be impartial and to not try to sway people&rsquo;s opinions one way or the other. But there are certain exceptions to this, such as blog posts and opinion pieces, in which the author is free to give out his own personal thoughts regarding an issue.</p><p>Another principle which is as important, is to never give out false information or misinformation. Obviously, there are a lot of outlets that tend to do just that, which is sad, especially considering the fact that they tend to get away with it. This is one of the reasons why people try to avoid the press and reading newspapers. Having such a profession be stained by these acts is heart breaking when you consider the fact that in the past journalists even got wounded or killed in the field when trying to get classified information to the public. In that regard, I think anyone should respect or at least try to understand the importance of this job in our society.</p><p>Of course, journalism is not a one-man job. There are many people involved in a news company. There are people who investigate the stories and write them, there are editors who correct mistakes or reformulate certain phrases, there are redactors who choose the importance of articles and where they should go on the newspaper, website or when they should air in case of televised news, there are reporters whose job is to report directly in front of the place of which the article talks about and, of course there are presenters who basically narrate and host televised news.</p><p>As you can see, journalism isn&rsquo;t necessarily easy. It involves ethics, hard work, team work and inspiration in order to make articles sound better and draw the attention of the reader. I think we can all respect journalism as a job, at the very least, even if we don&rsquo;t respect certain journalists and news outlets.</p><h2 id="heading-uc0s5" title="ID: heading-uc0s5" data-guid="ea204bbd-5bfe-4a7e-994f-eb33394772f4">Essay about hobbies</h2><p>Fie că vorbim despre citit, un anumit sport sau o altă activitate facută de bună voie în timpul liber, Essay about hobbies ne spune că vorbim defapt despre un hobby. Deși uneori văzute ca și pierderi de timp, Essay about hobbies ne arată că activitațile din timpul liber, au o importanță crucială pentru persoana care le practică, oferind noi aptitudini cum ar fi condiția fizică, reflexele mai bune sau pur și simplu un prilej de relaxare. Essay about hobbies încurajează cititorii să facă ceea ce le place în timpul liber și oferă un exemplu excelent.</p><h3 id="heading-ldtae" title="ID: heading-ldtae">Essay</h3><p>Hobbies are activities done regularly during a person&rsquo;s leisure time for pleasure. They can range from a wide variety of pastimes based on a certain individual&rsquo;s interests. Hobbies can dramatically improve one&rsquo;s personality and character traits. Through them we can discover talents and abilities that would otherwise be hidden from us. For instance, if you&rsquo;re hobby is sports, then you will inevitably get better and better, thus giving you an extra physical advantage over others.</p><p>My personal hobbies include video games, reading books and listening to music. But how do these types of hobbies help a person, you may ask? Well, video games are a known way to improve one&rsquo;s reflexes and hand-to-eye coordination. Reading books gives me new information and inspires my imagination. Listening to music soothes my stress and gives me good feelings.</p><p>So, what are your hobbies? Perhaps you enjoy going for a walk in the woods. Or maybe you try to relax yourself while gardening. If you think that you don&rsquo;t know what suits you exactly, try out different things and see what works for you. We all need to get away from the daily stress of a monotone life. Doing things that don&rsquo;t recreate your soul can be depressing. That&rsquo;s why people need to find pastimes suited to their own personality and interests.</p><p>I would like to elaborate a little more about my personal favorite hobby, so that you can better understand how exactly it has helped me overcome the daily struggle of real life. I started playing video games from quite a fragile age. I was around 5 or 6 years old. Even as a child, some video games that I played tended to be quite violent. Titles such as Mortal Kombat or Doom come to mind in an instant. Now, we all know the stigma that this sort of activity gets, especially when done by children. Actually, I can confirm from experience that it&rsquo;s quite the opposite. Along with talks from my parents, I understood that violent behavior has no place in the real world and that it should only stay in the virtual environment. Instead of turning into a violent person, over the years, this types of games were simply entertainment for me and nothing more. It was actually quite the opposite, they helped me relax in times of anger and stress.</p><p>Furthermore, some video games, such as the Metal Gear series, have intriguing stories that will ultimately captivate you just as much as good books like The picture of Dorian Gravy, for example. I can testify that I learned a lot from these experiences and that they ultimately made me a better person than I was. Don&rsquo;t let others disconsider you because of your hobbies. Take pride in them and let them make you a unique individual.</p><p>As an end note, I would like to conclude that hobbies help us not just relax, but be better at certain things. Whether it&rsquo;s about physical or brain activity, you have nothing to lose while engaging into a hobby, but there is a lot of experience to be earned and lessons to be learned.</p><h2 id="heading-y0wca" title="ID: heading-y0wca">Essay about a dream</h2><p>Essay about a dream este o lucrare care discută un aspect fundamental în viața oricărei persoane, visele. A nu fi confundată cu o lucrare freudiană despre natura subconștientului, Essay about a dream este o lucrare care discută visele ca fiind obiective individuale ale fiecăruia dintre noi, importanța acestora, precum și sfaturi pentru a le atinge evitând descurajările ce pot apărea de-a lungul drumului. Dacă unul dintre obiectivele tale este să iei un 10 la următorul examen, eseul este o lucrare care îți va putea oferi o mâna de ajutor.</p><h3 id="heading-4hgqa" title="ID: heading-4hgqa">Essay</h3><p>Most people already know Martin Luther King&rsquo;s famous speech &ldquo;I have a dream&rdquo;, in which he described a world where racism would be abolished and every person, no matter what skin colour, would live alongside one another in peace. Although that dream hasn&rsquo;t fully developed, we are way above how racist issues were treated in the last century.</p><p>Just like his dream, our dreams take hard work, patience and time in order to be achieved. I do believe that our dreams are worth fighting for, especially if they make us happy and the world a better place. In a sense, our dreams define us as persons, they are the essence of what we want to achieve. Who we are is only a stepping stone to what who can become. There are numerous things that we may want to change in this world, or in our community. What is important is to keep focus and never lose hope. After all, Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day.</p><p>There are many examples of people who achieved their dreams. Celebrities, for instance, always tell stories about how they were just regular people like us and how they came to make their dreams come true. Some stories involve a lot of luck, while others will tell you that talent and hard work are required. I think a combination of those two is ideal in achieving our goals. Of course, the dreams that we pursue and the context of fulfilling them vary from person to person. It is very rare that you will find stories that are similar on all aspects. We can conclude from this that a lot of creativity might be involved in the process of making our dreams come true.</p><p>Some dreams are smaller and some are bigger, what matters is for us to realize the complexity of our dreams and what strategies we need to come up with in order to succeed. People often forget that dreaming without actually doing anything does nothing but tempt our wishes even further without accomplishing anything. Sure, we might get stuck on our way sometimes, we might find ourselves in a place from which we don&rsquo;t know how to escape, but the important thing is to keep focused and realize that anything has a solution, if you know where to look. Any road has its fair share of bumps along the way.</p><p>Even as we grow up, we need to work in order to advance. Even something that seems trivial, such as education, is earned through hard work. Sure, today we have lots of methods at our disposal, but even then we need to put off effort to retain all our acquired information. Whatever your dreams may be, it is also important to be realistic. Try not to grab something that is unreachable when starting out. For instance, when opening a new business, do not try to compete against huge corporations. You have to work your way up to building your brand and getting customers, and only then can you truly compete against the bigger guys. But that&rsquo;s just one example out of many. Dreams can be made out of a lot of things. Cling on to them, cherish them, strive to achieve them and always keep a level-headed mentality.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="fashion-and-beauty.html" title="Essay about fashion, beauty &amp; love" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about fashion and beauty</span></a></div></div></div></div>

Deși știm cu toții că este greșit să judeci pe cineva după prima impresie, Essay about how the first impression can be misleading ne arată ca această atitudine este folosită mai des decât am vrea să recunoaștem, dând mai multă importanță felului în care ne prezentăm, dar în același timp dând naștere unor atitudini și prejudicii care de cele mai multe ori nu sunt deloc binevenite. Citește Essay about how the first impression can be misleading pentru a da o bună impresie la următorul examen, și a prinde nota mult așteptată.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-hxv0f\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-hxv0f\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe know that judging others is wrong sometimes, especially when the assumptions we make are based on things that we know very little of. There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that first impressions matter quite a lot in any given situation, but they can also be very misleading. Not everything is as it seems, especially beings as complex as humans are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs hypocritical as it may be to judge someone based on their looks alone, we have to admit that to a certain degree, we all do it. Even teachers tell us that judging people is bad, but still judge us by the way we dress, for example, on the first day of classes. Judging people is inevitable, as it is part of the very essence of human nature. Sure, you might say that you can get an idea from what a person is like even from the first impression, but it can be very misleading, especially if the person knows how to act accordingly and tell you what you want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn theory, observing a person\u0026rsquo;s behaviour, their body language, their tone, their vocabulary and other things can give us a good but possibly misleading first impression. A good speaker may convince you that they\u0026rsquo;re trustworthy, yet when it comes down to sharing important information with them, you might find out that your secrets are now known by everyone in the vicinity. On the flipside, a person who seems shy and introverted at first glance, might actually be a party animal or very talkative given a certain group of individuals and a certain environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStereotypes are yet another misleading factor when it comes to first impressions. They create a pre-established image in our head about how an individual with certain characteristics might be. For instance, we all know the classic racial stereotypes or the stereotypes about people who listen to different genres of music. We rely too much on labelling people and we tend to forget that we are all human. Every person that you will ever meet is a unique individual. Just because they share certain characteristics within a group doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that they share all of the attributes of said group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bottom line is that although first impressions matter, it is not wise to judge people based only on that little knowledge that we receive the first time seeing them. You never know what surprises are in store when establishing a connection with someone. Sometimes, they might be exactly as you expected them to be from the start, but most of the time, the reality is far different from the image in our head. We should learn to judge little and observe more, because, after all, only through observation and communication can we truly understand humans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-hl3ts\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-hl3ts\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d91ff284-1581-483d-9ad1-fab14cc3cc6a\u0022\u003eEssay about an embarrassing moment\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about an embarrassing moment este o lucrare care empatizează cu fiecare dintre noi, având ca temă, un moment jenant din viața noastră.

There are no exceptions, we all have our very own little awkward moments that make life unpleasant. The trick to getting past such moments is to not lose focus and scoff them off or devise a strategy to ensure that we can avoid them as many times as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing mostly introverted, I have a huge fear of speaking in public. I\u0026rsquo;d much rather spend a night in a creepy, sleazy motel room than to be forced to partake in the act of public speaking. Regardless, in school we are all forced to do this thing at least a few times a year, when answering the teacher\u0026rsquo;s question or when an oral exam is on its way. For me, the less people there are in the room, the better. Formalities tend to make me feel nervous, especially when a large group is involved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhenever I have to do this type of thing, I tend to stutter, my face turns red and I can barely keep calm. However, I have moved on past most of these moments, because teachers are trained to empathize with emotional people. But there were a few exceptions when the teacher\u0026rsquo;s remarks about my stuttering and lack of ability to focus have made me even more nervous than I was initially. The most embarrassing moment of this type that I can clearly remember occurred when I was in the 5th grade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur entire school held a sermon for Romania\u0026rsquo;s National Day. The children who were good at singing had to perform certain traditional songs from our country, while me and others were practically forced to memorize poems and recite them in front of the entire school yard. Memorizing the poem was not a big issue for me, but when the time came to face my fear of public speaking in front of so many people I trembled. My face turned red and I started stuttering. I recited my poem very quietly while a teacher in the back kept telling me to speak louder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI felt so embarrassed that I started to recite the poem as fast as I could just so I would get it over with. Fortunately for me, almost everyone knew that I had stage fright and no one laughed, but I knew, deep down, that they looked at me with pitifulness. I felt so embarrassed that I immediately left school afterwards and avoided coming the next day. To make matters worse, the teacher who instructed me to memorize the poem subtly reminded me of the event every time she got the opportunity. I hated her so much for this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, I scoffed it off as if it never happened and I had very good classmates who always tried to encourage me and give me advice about how to lose this stage fright of mine. I think we can all move past embarrassing events if we have the right people by our side. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let others make us feel ashamed, for it is in our nature to fail from time to time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ytl15\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ytl15\u0022 data-guid=\u002201bf1827-93de-4de6-800c-007a890bd9bf\u0022\u003eEssay about imagination\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about imagination este o lucrare ce ne amintește de una dintre cele mai frumoase capabilități ale minții noastre, imaginația. Fiind o abilitate pe care majoritatea o avem încă de când suntem mici, Essay about imagination ne arată puterea, importanța și posibilitățile deschise de această aptitudine ce de multe ori este ignorată sau luată în râs. Citește eseul pentru a-ți întări cunoștințele.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-3c8jb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-3c8jb\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagination is the core of all creativity and knowledge. What would the world be if people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use their imagination? It would certainly be a lot more boring. Ever since we are children, we use imagination to make up different scenarios, think about the future, come up with ideas and escape reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagination cannot be touched, it is unreal, it is all in our head. But it is so good to be able to imagine things, even events of stuff that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible in real life. Just think about all the books, movies and games that were created by people\u0026rsquo;s imagination. Life with be boring without it, that\u0026rsquo;s for certain. The good thing about imagination is that it\u0026rsquo;s not just an escape from reality, but it can also be useful to us. You may want to approach someone regarding the problem. In this case, use your imagination to figure out all the possibilities and plan out the conversation accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, the use of imagination also applies into critical thinking problems. You\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard about things on the internet called \u0026ldquo;life hacks\u0026rdquo;. Those are great examples of people using their imagination to make life easier or certain tasks less stressful. Being able to make life easy without sacrificing its complexity is a sign of a healthy imagination. One can also use this power to solve problems that don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have an obligatory way of being dealt with. There are times in life where you may only see one solution, but try to keep calm and use your imagination and instincts to see if there isn\u0026rsquo;t another way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeaving problems and solutions aside, I cannot imagine how life would have been without my favourite forms of entertainment. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine how it would have been not reading my favourite books, not watching my favourite movies or playing my favourite video games. These are all products of human imagination that we use daily. If there is a parallel universe where imagination doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, then I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t want to be part of that world. I\u0026rsquo;d much rather live in this world, with all its flaws than in one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t display any form of imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI just tried using my imagination to imagine a world without this. I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably the best metaphor for hell that anyone could\u0026rsquo;ve come up with. And it\u0026rsquo;s as ironic as it can be. Using your imagination to imagine a world without this exact same thing is extremely ironic, just thinking about how paradoxical this is makes my head hurt. As a conclusion, this is exactly the magic I was talking about. Through imagination, I just created a paradox. I and many others have created situations that couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly exist in real life, and that is beautiful. Use your imagination as often as you can, for it is the most powerful tool at mankind\u0026rsquo;s disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-hwgjm\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-hwgjm\u0022 data-guid=\u00224d304e74-ab54-40be-8af6-f6e99cf17188\u0022\u003eEssay about graffiti\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă te-ai uitat vreodată pe un perete, neștiind dacă ceea ce vezi este artă sau vandalism, Essay about graffiti poate să-ti clarifice situația.

Citește eseul despre graffiti pentru a-ți rafina gusturile în arta stradală.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-q8ehg\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-q8ehg\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Art is an evolutionary act. The shape of art and its role in society is constantly changing. At no point is art static. There are no rules.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people still debate whether graffiti is art or vandalism. I think it can be both. To put it in the simplest way possible, if it looks good, expresses something, takes talent and time to produce but it was done on someone else\u0026rsquo;s property, then it is vandal art. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Not all graffiti is vandalism, for the simple reason that in some cases the owner agrees beforehand that a wall on his property shall be painted by someone else. This is the most preferable way to do graffiti, because it is harmless and affects no one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other cases, it\u0026rsquo;s not art at all, just plain vandalism. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember how many times I\u0026rsquo;ve been through ghettos and seen lots of poorly drawn graffiti, or graffiti that represented simple words with no special \u0026ldquo;font\u0026rdquo;, or drawings that could\u0026rsquo;ve been done by grade schoolers, or even vulgar drawings executed with poor taste. Sadly, these are the examples that make people have such bad opinions about graffiti and that\u0026rsquo;s a shame, because it has the potential to be a new art form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame. Looking at some of the murals that were painted on large buildings in urban areas, with the approval of the owner, and then seeing jerks writing vulgar words on walls just because they can and then having the two compared and be considered the same thing really annoys me. The first example is art, whilst the second is vandalism, no doubt about it. Yet it is these kinds of acts that make people have such a bad opinion about graffiti overall. It\u0026rsquo;s sad because street artists who actually have talent and ethics get compared to vandals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome might argue that the purposes and motivations that drive artists to put up their work in certain public spaces can be summed up as a form of protest. Taking free speech into consideration, one cannot deny another person\u0026rsquo;s right to protest, but even when doing so, you have to be careful not to deny other people\u0026rsquo;s rights. When vandalizing another person\u0026rsquo;s property, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you are doing. You are defacing another human being\u0026rsquo;s building without their permission, thus the reason it can no longer be considered free speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we can all agree that graffiti does have the potential of becoming a new art form. Some people already consider it just that, hence the preferential terms \u0026ldquo;street art\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;urban art\u0026rdquo;. Though misunderstood by the majority of the population, graffiti artists can turn around their image by doing what they do best, legally. It is up to them and to other art lovers to help promote this movement and shed light on what it actually is, so that the negative image people have will eventually disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-xf2t0\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-xf2t0\u0022 data-guid=\u0022bf7f40b4-e642-4acf-904a-cfaa28fa8833\u0022\u003eEssay about journalism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFie că vorbim despre știri, ziare sau articole, Essay about journalism le pune pe toate într-o singură categorie.

Eseul scoate în evidență greutățile și provocările meseriei, fiind un material excelent pentru oricine dorește să scrie un eseu care să impresioneze cititorul, și să ridice rating-ul lucrării la 100%.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-td6tz\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-td6tz\u0022\u003eEsssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone\u0027s feelings.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJournalists tend to get a lot of hate from people, sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad reasons. Although tabloids have infested our society with unnecessary news about some celebrity\u0026rsquo;s haircut, we have to respect the reporters and newspaper writers who strive to give out important information to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJournalism involves ethics, morality and devotement. Although certain outlets and shady news site do not respect these principles, we cannot condemn the jobs of journalists as a whole. The freedom of expression was fought for exactly so that we could be free to read, write and say anything we wanted. The first principle of journalism is to be impartial and to not try to sway people\u0026rsquo;s opinions one way or the other. But there are certain exceptions to this, such as blog posts and opinion pieces, in which the author is free to give out his own personal thoughts regarding an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother principle which is as important, is to never give out false information or misinformation. Obviously, there are a lot of outlets that tend to do just that, which is sad, especially considering the fact that they tend to get away with it. This is one of the reasons why people try to avoid the press and reading newspapers. Having such a profession be stained by these acts is heart breaking when you consider the fact that in the past journalists even got wounded or killed in the field when trying to get classified information to the public. In that regard, I think anyone should respect or at least try to understand the importance of this job in our society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, journalism is not a one-man job. There are many people involved in a news company. There are people who investigate the stories and write them, there are editors who correct mistakes or reformulate certain phrases, there are redactors who choose the importance of articles and where they should go on the newspaper, website or when they should air in case of televised news, there are reporters whose job is to report directly in front of the place of which the article talks about and, of course there are presenters who basically narrate and host televised news.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, journalism isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily easy. It involves ethics, hard work, team work and inspiration in order to make articles sound better and draw the attention of the reader. I think we can all respect journalism as a job, at the very least, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t respect certain journalists and news outlets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-uc0s5\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-uc0s5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ea204bbd-5bfe-4a7e-994f-eb33394772f4\u0022\u003eEssay about hobbies\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFie că vorbim despre citit, un anumit sport sau o altă activitate facută de bună voie în timpul liber, Essay about hobbies ne spune că vorbim defapt despre un hobby. Deși uneori văzute ca și pierderi de timp, Essay about hobbies ne arată că activitațile din timpul liber, au o importanță crucială pentru persoana care le practică, oferind noi aptitudini cum ar fi condiția fizică, reflexele mai bune sau pur și simplu un prilej de relaxare. Essay about hobbies încurajează cititorii să facă ceea ce le place în timpul liber și oferă un exemplu excelent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-ldtae\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ldtae\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHobbies are activities done regularly during a person\u0026rsquo;s leisure time for pleasure. They can range from a wide variety of pastimes based on a certain individual\u0026rsquo;s interests. Hobbies can dramatically improve one\u0026rsquo;s personality and character traits. Through them we can discover talents and abilities that would otherwise be hidden from us. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re hobby is sports, then you will inevitably get better and better, thus giving you an extra physical advantage over others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy personal hobbies include video games, reading books and listening to music. But how do these types of hobbies help a person, you may ask? Well, video games are a known way to improve one\u0026rsquo;s reflexes and hand-to-eye coordination. Reading books gives me new information and inspires my imagination. Listening to music soothes my stress and gives me good feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what are your hobbies? Perhaps you enjoy going for a walk in the woods. Or maybe you try to relax yourself while gardening. If you think that you don\u0026rsquo;t know what suits you exactly, try out different things and see what works for you. We all need to get away from the daily stress of a monotone life. Doing things that don\u0026rsquo;t recreate your soul can be depressing. That\u0026rsquo;s why people need to find pastimes suited to their own personality and interests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would like to elaborate a little more about my personal favorite hobby, so that you can better understand how exactly it has helped me overcome the daily struggle of real life. I started playing video games from quite a fragile age. I was around 5 or 6 years old. Even as a child, some video games that I played tended to be quite violent. Titles such as Mortal Kombat or Doom come to mind in an instant. Now, we all know the stigma that this sort of activity gets, especially when done by children. Actually, I can confirm from experience that it\u0026rsquo;s quite the opposite. Along with talks from my parents, I understood that violent behavior has no place in the real world and that it should only stay in the virtual environment. Instead of turning into a violent person, over the years, this types of games were simply entertainment for me and nothing more. It was actually quite the opposite, they helped me relax in times of anger and stress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, some video games, such as the Metal Gear series, have intriguing stories that will ultimately captivate you just as much as good books like The picture of Dorian Gravy, for example. I can testify that I learned a lot from these experiences and that they ultimately made me a better person than I was. Don\u0026rsquo;t let others disconsider you because of your hobbies. Take pride in them and let them make you a unique individual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an end note, I would like to conclude that hobbies help us not just relax, but be better at certain things. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s about physical or brain activity, you have nothing to lose while engaging into a hobby, but there is a lot of experience to be earned and lessons to be learned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-y0wca\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-y0wca\u0022\u003eEssay about a dream\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about a dream este o lucrare care discută un aspect fundamental în viața oricărei persoane, visele. A nu fi confundată cu o lucrare freudiană despre natura subconștientului, Essay about a dream este o lucrare care discută visele ca fiind obiective individuale ale fiecăruia dintre noi, importanța acestora, precum și sfaturi pentru a le atinge evitând descurajările ce pot apărea de-a lungul drumului. Dacă unul dintre obiectivele tale este să iei un 10 la următorul examen, eseul este o lucrare care îți va putea oferi o mâna de ajutor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-4hgqa\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-4hgqa\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost people already know Martin Luther King\u0026rsquo;s famous speech \u0026ldquo;I have a dream\u0026rdquo;, in which he described a world where racism would be abolished and every person, no matter what skin colour, would live alongside one another in peace. Although that dream hasn\u0026rsquo;t fully developed, we are way above how racist issues were treated in the last century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust like his dream, our dreams take hard work, patience and time in order to be achieved. I do believe that our dreams are worth fighting for, especially if they make us happy and the world a better place. In a sense, our dreams define us as persons, they are the essence of what we want to achieve. Who we are is only a stepping stone to what who can become. There are numerous things that we may want to change in this world, or in our community. What is important is to keep focus and never lose hope. After all, Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many examples of people who achieved their dreams. Celebrities, for instance, always tell stories about how they were just regular people like us and how they came to make their dreams come true. Some stories involve a lot of luck, while others will tell you that talent and hard work are required. I think a combination of those two is ideal in achieving our goals. Of course, the dreams that we pursue and the context of fulfilling them vary from person to person. It is very rare that you will find stories that are similar on all aspects. We can conclude from this that a lot of creativity might be involved in the process of making our dreams come true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome dreams are smaller and some are bigger, what matters is for us to realize the complexity of our dreams and what strategies we need to come up with in order to succeed. People often forget that dreaming without actually doing anything does nothing but tempt our wishes even further without accomplishing anything. Sure, we might get stuck on our way sometimes, we might find ourselves in a place from which we don\u0026rsquo;t know how to escape, but the important thing is to keep focused and realize that anything has a solution, if you know where to look. Any road has its fair share of bumps along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven as we grow up, we need to work in order to advance. Even something that seems trivial, such as education, is earned through hard work. Sure, today we have lots of methods at our disposal, but even then we need to put off effort to retain all our acquired information. Whatever your dreams may be, it is also important to be realistic. Try not to grab something that is unreachable when starting out. For instance, when opening a new business, do not try to compete against huge corporations. You have to work your way up to building your brand and getting customers, and only then can you truly compete against the bigger guys. But that\u0026rsquo;s just one example out of many. Dreams can be made out of a lot of things. Cling on to them, cherish them, strive to achieve them and always keep a level-headed mentality.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Other themes of essays (dreams, hobbies, imagination, journalism, etc)","MetaDescription":"Essay about how the first impression can be misleading este o lucrare despre unul dintre lucrurile mai controversate pe care le întâlnim în viața de zi cu zi, prima impresie.
