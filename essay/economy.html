Deși pare ca un subiect trivial, Essay about economics ne arată impactul acestei științe asupra vieții noastre de zi cu zi, în special când vine vorba de produsele la care avem acces și prețul lor. Fie că vorbim despre o periuță de dinți sau o mașină, Essay about economics ne arată diferite metode de a privi procesul economic, rolul cumpărătorilor și al industriilor, implicarea statului pe piață, totul pentru a te ajuta să iei o notă cât mai mare la urmatorul test.</p><h3 id="heading-zpdq1" title="ID: heading-zpdq1">Essay</h3><p>Economics is a social science which studies production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. There are several different viewpoints regarding economics, some of them effective, while others less effective. Each school of thought regards economics in a certain way that can represent either an advantage or disadvantage for certain groups of people.</p><p>Even with different views over the economy, one cannot ignore basic principles such as &ldquo;supply and demand&rdquo;. This principle refers to the rate by which items are supplied to the populace depending on their demand. If the demand is high but products are scarce, then that makes those products more valuable and thus more expensive. If supply is high but demand is low, then the product becomes cheaper and overall less valuable.</p><p>Moreover, this also affects services. The amount of labour isn&rsquo;t necessarily equal to the price of the product or service, but demand is what makes the difference. As an excellent example, in the US, a bottle of Coca-Cola is as cheap as a bottle of water, and they require different amounts of work for production. This is due to both of them being in high demand but on an even higher supply, which dictates their relatively cheap value. The production of bottled water is relatively easy, as the only worries that the company has are transport, marketing and manufacturing the bottles. When it comes to Coke, the production process is more complex, but it is made easier by using machines.</p><p>What are the various economic theories used around the world? We have the Marxist theory which is still being used in socialist and communist countries, we have Keynesian economics, neoclassical economics and Austrian economics. Marxist, or Marxian, economics put a heavy focus on the labour theory of value and the surplus theory. Both of these theories are inapplicable in the real world because they don&rsquo;t take into factor the demand for products. For example, a carriage may take more time to be created by a single human that it would take a robot to manufacture a car, but we all know which of these products is more valuable.</p><p>Keynesian economics churned out a huge mistake, now known simply as the &ldquo;broken window&rdquo; fallacy. This theory implies that having something broken by an outside force stimulates the economy by creating more demand for said product that needs fixing. Obviously, a lot of people made fun of the matter by saying that we should have more hurricanes and natural disasters in order to fix the economy.</p><p>Neoclassical and Austrian economics are currently being used in the majority of developed countries to a certain extent. They advocate for free markets as the best response for a person&rsquo;s needs. Of course, government interference may vary depending on the country, so that&rsquo;s why we have yet to see what these theories can fully provide to society. Economics clashing with politics is nothing new, so just hope that your government is smart enough to take economic theories seriously and try not to regulate the market too much.</p><p>Like it or not, in the end the world economy will affect you one way or another. So be sure to study this science as much as you can, so you will always know what to expect.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-7nzam" title="ID: heading-7nzam" data-guid="0c95c079-c7bc-4938-a10a-3002592a9f0a">Essay about money</h2><p>Ce sunt banii si ce valoare punem pe ei? Essay about money este o lucrare facuta special ca sa raspunda la aceasta intrebare. Fie ca suntem de acord sau nu cu zicala &rdquo;banii nu aduc fericirea&bdquo; , Essay about money prezinta mai multe puncte de vedere asupra acestei dileme, si ne arata diferite opinii asupra unei probleme vechi de cand s-au inventat monedele. Essay about money este o lucrare redactata cu atentie, care poate pune pe ganduri cititorul, oferind si un model excelent pentru teste si examene.</p><h3 id="heading-40n0q" title="ID: heading-40n0q">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Money may not buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in a Jaguar than on a bus.&rdquo;</p><p>It is no secret that money is an important issue for many people on the planet. Some may think money makes you greedy or arrogant, while others think that having money is a sign of intelligence and hard work. Both of those opinions are true to a certain extent.</p><p>Money comes in a variety of forms, or currencies to be exact. It is not necessarily an item itself, as much as it represents a certain value. As we all know, most money isn&rsquo;t even printed on paper, it&rsquo;s just numbers on computers. With that said, there are a variety of ways to store money, both online and offline and there are also a number of unofficial currencies, such as bitcoin and litecoin. But without getting too technical, at the end of the day, from an objective perspective, money simply represents value.</p><p>From an ethical standpoint, being wealthy is fine as long as the resources have been gathered fairly, as in hard work, innovation and intelligence. It is not, nor should it be, acceptable to earn money through mischievous schemes such as stealing, lying, cheating or accepting bribes for different favors. But why is money so important in our society? The answer is simple, really. To make the lives of sellers and consumers alike easier. Imagine how inconvenient it would be if you would have to trade an item every time you wanted to buy a cup of coffee.</p><p>But does money bring happiness? People keep hearing the classical saying &ldquo;money can&rsquo;t buy happiness&rdquo;. Suffice to say that statement is purely subjective. What makes you happy might not necessarily work on others and vice versa. Sure, everyone needs friends, family and love. I think that would make any person happy. But, as stated earlier, there are also other things that may make some of us cheerful. For example, I was extremely excited when I finally got a laptop. No longer would I need to rely solely on my smartphone when I was going out of town for a long period of time.</p><p>You know what else money can buy and definitely makes people happy? Treatment for a variety of illnesses, both when it comes to researching and developing them and when it comes down to buying said medication. Do you want yet another humanistic example? Buying food and clothes for homeless people offers both the donor and the receiver tremendous joy. So, in practicality, money does buy happiness, it can bring tears to the eyes of a person who hasn&rsquo;t had anything to eat in days, as yet another example.<br>As you can see, we just disproved that old saying. I think the problem is that people who are unhappy with their money don&rsquo;t know what to spend it on, or they simply have everything that money can buy and feel no more satisfaction.</p><p>In conclusion, money should be looked at objectively. Money itself is neither good, nor evil, it all depends on what people are spending it on. If you want to make the world a better place, a financial donation to the right people can make all the difference.</p><h2 id="heading-8u8x4" title="ID: heading-8u8x4" data-guid="60d5dddf-0d55-48b4-9b4e-60ca84171a16">Essay about digital banking</h2><p>Dacă ți-ai comandat vreodată ceva de pe internet, ai plătit facturi în mod digital sau ai transferat bani fară să pleci din fața calculatorului, probabil că ești familiar cu conținutul din Essay about digital banking. Trăind într-o lume în care suntem la un click distanță de aproape orice, Essay about digital banking ia în vizor unul dintre serviciile care a devenit extrem de popular în ultimii ani printre posesorii de conturi bancare. Aratându-ne avantajele unei rețele bancare accesibile de oriunde dar și pericolele prezentate de furtul de identitate, acest material este o sursă de inspirație pentru orice elev.</p><h3 id="heading-tg966" title="ID: heading-tg966">Essay</h3><p>Along with the advancement of digital technology comes yet another commodity which aims to make life much easier for people: internet banking. Years ago, whenever we wanted to transfer money, we would have to be physically present at a bank kiosk in order to deposit, convert or retrieve currency. Nowadays, we can easily do such transactions on the web, and if we ever need cash, we can just go to ATM machines, which also connect to our bank account digitally, through the magic of the internet.</p><p>This is beneficial to everyone, as it makes transactions between people and organizations seamless and rapid. However, this thing also comes with its disadvantages that may hinder the otherwise convenient user experience. First and foremost, there are certain tariffs put in place for the management of you online banking account. Depending on the service provider, you may have to pay a monthly fee, which can vary depending on the bank and on your and education status, or you may have to pay interest rates to the bank for every transaction that exceeds a certain amount of money.</p><p>Furthermore, no operating system or program is ever a hundred percent secure. Doing things digitally leaves you vulnerable to skilled hackers, as shown by the millions of cases of identity theft and fraud that have been committed worldwide. If an intruder gains access to your account, they automatically see all your personal information, as well as your credit card information, giving them all the necessary details to do transactions in your name. Thus, they can drain your entire bank account, and depending on the type of contract that you&rsquo;re on, they might even exceed past the sum that you have deposited.</p><p>To be fair, this can happen even if you don&rsquo;t have internet banking, as your credit card information is required by any website in order to complete a transaction. The advantage of having a digital banking account in this case is that you get notified whenever a transaction is made, so if something suspicious is happening, you can always call the bank and tell them about it. From there, you can request an emergency lock on your account and credit card so that no further damage can be committed. The bank then further investigates along with the police to track down the criminal.</p><p>However, if you want to be compensated for the sum of money that you just lost, you have to go through an extensive bureaucratic process in order to prove that you weren&rsquo;t the one doing all those transactions. Even so, it is way better than losing the money forever. If you are careful and vigilant, having an internet banking account can really help you resolve such issues, thus negating the bad aspects of digital banking. You always have to be careful with your information, especially on the internet, so knowing how to combat the disadvantages is the key to secure digital banking.</p><h2 id="heading-vcv81" title="ID: heading-vcv81" data-guid="f5dd12d9-3962-4b64-9a84-471725a866db">Essay about advertising</h2><p>Peste tot în jurul nostru avem reclame. Essay about advertising este aici să ne explice de unde au apărut reclamele pe pereți, și ce caută poze artistice pe cutiile de hârtie igienică. Prezentând un scurt istoric al reclamelor, Essay about advertising ne povestește istoria acestei industrii controversate, și ne prezintă oamenii din spatele acesteia.</p><h3 id="heading-tvnto" title="ID: heading-tvnto">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Ads sell a great deal more than products. They sell values, images, and concepts of success and worth.&rdquo;</p><p>I think advertising is a form of art, simply because a lot of creativity is necessary in order to ensure the creation of a successful ad campaign. There are, however, examples of advertising that make people cringe when they hear this word. People have been promoting their products ever since ancient times, but the ad industry merely took off in its current form in late Victorian England.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas J. Barratt was the chairman of a soap manufacturing company called &ldquo;Pears &amp; Soap&rdquo;. His idea to promote the high class cleanliness of the product was to place a painting in their advertisement. The painting depicted a child playing with bubbles, drawn in the style of that time period. The feedback to this move was both positive and negative, with consumers adoring the idea and marching forward to buy the product, while critics kept saying that it wasn&rsquo;t art, because the painter had sold his work for money, which was a big misdemeanor from artist&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>After this event, the industry as we know it was born. Loads of artists started to work in this field. Names such as Alphonse Mucha, Salvador Dali, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, Andy Warhol and lots others put their stamp on advertising campaigns, designs and logos. Art and advertising were like brothers from here on out. Not to mention all the campaign that paid homage or parodied well known paintings and sculptures, such as Levi&rsquo;s David ad campaign or the numerous commercials featuring Da Vinci&rsquo;s Mona Lisa.</p><p>To a certain extent, advertising manipulates the public&rsquo;s expectations, it enriches their imagination in order to sell a certain product. But if it wasn&rsquo;t for this industry&rsquo;s endeavor, we wouldn&rsquo;t have all these well-known, top quality brands that we enjoy buying today. If a product is good but fails to promote itself, then it has failed on the market. On the flipside, if a product is bad but has good promotion, the backlash against it will be even more furious, so it&rsquo;s a win-win situation in either case.</p><p>The main technique used by marketing people is branding. This allows them to create a unique image for a certain product or brand, thus making it easier for people to identify it in a crowded sector of a shopping center. Standing out from the crowd is important in this trade, that&rsquo;s why they put so much emphasis on the physical aspect and on TV commercials.</p><p>In conclusion, advertising can be false at times, but it is merely means to an end. While we are bombarded with commercials everywhere we go, we are not obligated to buy or even try the products, so no harm is done. Instead, we should appreciate creative ads, the ones with high emotional impact, the ones who stand out and are original and the memorable ads from back when we were kids, because they offer us nostalgia from those times. Like anything else, ads offer a sense of what it was like during a certain era, and they should be appreciated for putting that thing into perspective.</p><h2 id="heading-bla7i" title="ID: heading-bla7i" data-guid="113fff93-0224-4b81-aa12-c2d6ff479de6">Essay about doctors</h2><p>Essay about doctors este o lucrare care descrie niște personaje din viața noastră pe cât de înfricoșătoare, pe atât de eroice. Fie că ai o durere de burtă, un dinte de scos sau o operație de apendicită, Essay about doctors ne prezintă eroii în halate albe care ne fac viața mai bună și de multe ori chiar o salvează.</p><h3 id="heading-gcgub" title="ID: heading-gcgub">Essay</h3><p>Doctors are people who treat the ill and save countless lives with each passing day. They are professionals who have been training for years in order to achieve these goals. If you&rsquo;re feeling sick, there is no other person more qualified to treat you than a doctor. Furthermore, do not take advice from some shady person on the internet and instead, seek out professional help, or else you might regret the decision.</p><p>While in medical school, future doctors take up to 6 years to train for their profession and become experts in a certain medical field. As with all schools, there are bound to be drop-out students, but those who remain and learn until the end are bound to become surgeons, dentists, oncologists, ophthalmologists and other specializations. It is no easy task to learn everything possible about the human body.</p><p>When they finally begin their careers, doctors undertake The Hippocratic Oath, by which they swear to uphold certain ethical standards on their chosen path. Things included in this oath include respect for the hard work and achievements of those who have come before, applying all measures necessary in order to heal a patient, not being afraid to admit not knowing things which another doctor may know, to treat patients as human beings and respect their privacy etc.</p><p>One look at this oath is enough for anyone to realize what a huge task lies ahead of these special people. They dedicate their lives for others, they know what it means to truly be human and they know how to treat people with respect and patience. Of course, they are also human and they are bound to have their fair share of mistakes. There can also be bad doctors who got through med school by bribing the right people. Make sure to ask around about a certain doctor before deciding to pay them a visit.</p><p>This becomes especially important when searching for a surgeon who&rsquo;s going to make a sensitive operation. There have been countless malpractice cases all around the world, so your best bet in case of a surgeon is to search for someone who&rsquo;s renowned for their fineness, care and precision. Do not go to someone who is still in the practice stages, even if they are being supervised and are cheaper. Sure, all great surgeons had to start somewhere, but for important operations such as brain or heart surgery, it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>All in all, as a profession, the medical field is to be admired because it helps humankind. It may have its fair share of rotten apples, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from admiring people who actually put effort into their profession.</p><p>Show them the respect they deserve and never hesitate to contact these specialists whenever you feel ill. You have absolutely nothing to lose, only health to gain, and health is one of the most important gifts anyone can have.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay/family" title="Essay about family" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about family</span></a><a href="/essay/nature" title="Essay about nature" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about nature</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Deși pare ca un subiect trivial, Essay about economics ne arată impactul acestei științe asupra vieții noastre de zi cu zi, în special când vine vorba de produsele la care avem acces și prețul lor. Fie că vorbim despre o periuță de dinți sau o mașină, Essay about economics ne arată diferite metode de a privi procesul economic, rolul cumpărătorilor și al industriilor, implicarea statului pe piață, totul pentru a te ajuta să iei o notă cât mai mare la urmatorul test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-zpdq1\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-zpdq1\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomics is a social science which studies production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. There are several different viewpoints regarding economics, some of them effective, while others less effective. Each school of thought regards economics in a certain way that can represent either an advantage or disadvantage for certain groups of people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven with different views over the economy, one cannot ignore basic principles such as \u0026ldquo;supply and demand\u0026rdquo;. This principle refers to the rate by which items are supplied to the populace depending on their demand. If the demand is high but products are scarce, then that makes those products more valuable and thus more expensive. If supply is high but demand is low, then the product becomes cheaper and overall less valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, this also affects services. The amount of labour isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily equal to the price of the product or service, but demand is what makes the difference. As an excellent example, in the US, a bottle of Coca-Cola is as cheap as a bottle of water, and they require different amounts of work for production. This is due to both of them being in high demand but on an even higher supply, which dictates their relatively cheap value. The production of bottled water is relatively easy, as the only worries that the company has are transport, marketing and manufacturing the bottles. When it comes to Coke, the production process is more complex, but it is made easier by using machines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are the various economic theories used around the world? We have the Marxist theory which is still being used in socialist and communist countries, we have Keynesian economics, neoclassical economics and Austrian economics. Marxist, or Marxian, economics put a heavy focus on the labour theory of value and the surplus theory. Both of these theories are inapplicable in the real world because they don\u0026rsquo;t take into factor the demand for products. For example, a carriage may take more time to be created by a single human that it would take a robot to manufacture a car, but we all know which of these products is more valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeynesian economics churned out a huge mistake, now known simply as the \u0026ldquo;broken window\u0026rdquo; fallacy. This theory implies that having something broken by an outside force stimulates the economy by creating more demand for said product that needs fixing. Obviously, a lot of people made fun of the matter by saying that we should have more hurricanes and natural disasters in order to fix the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNeoclassical and Austrian economics are currently being used in the majority of developed countries to a certain extent. They advocate for free markets as the best response for a person\u0026rsquo;s needs. Of course, government interference may vary depending on the country, so that\u0026rsquo;s why we have yet to see what these theories can fully provide to society. Economics clashing with politics is nothing new, so just hope that your government is smart enough to take economic theories seriously and try not to regulate the market too much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike it or not, in the end the world economy will affect you one way or another. So be sure to study this science as much as you can, so you will always know what to expect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7nzam\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-7nzam\u0022 data-guid=\u00220c95c079-c7bc-4938-a10a-3002592a9f0a\u0022\u003eEssay about money\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCe sunt banii si ce valoare punem pe ei? Essay about money este o lucrare facuta special ca sa raspunda la aceasta intrebare. Fie ca suntem de acord sau nu cu zicala \u0026rdquo;banii nu aduc fericirea\u0026bdquo; , Essay about money prezinta mai multe puncte de vedere asupra acestei dileme, si ne arata diferite opinii asupra unei probleme vechi de cand s-au inventat monedele. Essay about money este o lucrare redactata cu atentie, care poate pune pe ganduri cititorul, oferind si un model excelent pentru teste si examene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-40n0q\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-40n0q\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Money may not buy happiness, but I\u0027d rather cry in a Jaguar than on a bus.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is no secret that money is an important issue for many people on the planet. Some may think money makes you greedy or arrogant, while others think that having money is a sign of intelligence and hard work. Both of those opinions are true to a certain extent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoney comes in a variety of forms, or currencies to be exact. It is not necessarily an item itself, as much as it represents a certain value. As we all know, most money isn\u0026rsquo;t even printed on paper, it\u0026rsquo;s just numbers on computers. With that said, there are a variety of ways to store money, both online and offline and there are also a number of unofficial currencies, such as bitcoin and litecoin. But without getting too technical, at the end of the day, from an objective perspective, money simply represents value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom an ethical standpoint, being wealthy is fine as long as the resources have been gathered fairly, as in hard work, innovation and intelligence. It is not, nor should it be, acceptable to earn money through mischievous schemes such as stealing, lying, cheating or accepting bribes for different favors. But why is money so important in our society? The answer is simple, really. To make the lives of sellers and consumers alike easier. Imagine how inconvenient it would be if you would have to trade an item every time you wanted to buy a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut does money bring happiness? People keep hearing the classical saying \u0026ldquo;money can\u0026rsquo;t buy happiness\u0026rdquo;. Suffice to say that statement is purely subjective. What makes you happy might not necessarily work on others and vice versa. Sure, everyone needs friends, family and love. I think that would make any person happy. But, as stated earlier, there are also other things that may make some of us cheerful. For example, I was extremely excited when I finally got a laptop. No longer would I need to rely solely on my smartphone when I was going out of town for a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou know what else money can buy and definitely makes people happy? Treatment for a variety of illnesses, both when it comes to researching and developing them and when it comes down to buying said medication. Do you want yet another humanistic example? Buying food and clothes for homeless people offers both the donor and the receiver tremendous joy. So, in practicality, money does buy happiness, it can bring tears to the eyes of a person who hasn\u0026rsquo;t had anything to eat in days, as yet another example.\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, we just disproved that old saying. I think the problem is that people who are unhappy with their money don\u0026rsquo;t know what to spend it on, or they simply have everything that money can buy and feel no more satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, money should be looked at objectively. Money itself is neither good, nor evil, it all depends on what people are spending it on. If you want to make the world a better place, a financial donation to the right people can make all the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8u8x4\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-8u8x4\u0022 data-guid=\u002260d5dddf-0d55-48b4-9b4e-60ca84171a16\u0022\u003eEssay about digital banking\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă ți-ai comandat vreodată ceva de pe internet, ai plătit facturi în mod digital sau ai transferat bani fară să pleci din fața calculatorului, probabil că ești familiar cu conținutul din Essay about digital banking. Trăind într-o lume în care suntem la un click distanță de aproape orice, Essay about digital banking ia în vizor unul dintre serviciile care a devenit extrem de popular în ultimii ani printre posesorii de conturi bancare. Aratându-ne avantajele unei rețele bancare accesibile de oriunde dar și pericolele prezentate de furtul de identitate, acest material este o sursă de inspirație pentru orice elev.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-tg966\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tg966\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlong with the advancement of digital technology comes yet another commodity which aims to make life much easier for people: internet banking. Years ago, whenever we wanted to transfer money, we would have to be physically present at a bank kiosk in order to deposit, convert or retrieve currency. Nowadays, we can easily do such transactions on the web, and if we ever need cash, we can just go to ATM machines, which also connect to our bank account digitally, through the magic of the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is beneficial to everyone, as it makes transactions between people and organizations seamless and rapid. However, this thing also comes with its disadvantages that may hinder the otherwise convenient user experience. First and foremost, there are certain tariffs put in place for the management of you online banking account. Depending on the service provider, you may have to pay a monthly fee, which can vary depending on the bank and on your and education status, or you may have to pay interest rates to the bank for every transaction that exceeds a certain amount of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, no operating system or program is ever a hundred percent secure. Doing things digitally leaves you vulnerable to skilled hackers, as shown by the millions of cases of identity theft and fraud that have been committed worldwide. If an intruder gains access to your account, they automatically see all your personal information, as well as your credit card information, giving them all the necessary details to do transactions in your name. Thus, they can drain your entire bank account, and depending on the type of contract that you\u0026rsquo;re on, they might even exceed past the sum that you have deposited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, this can happen even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have internet banking, as your credit card information is required by any website in order to complete a transaction. The advantage of having a digital banking account in this case is that you get notified whenever a transaction is made, so if something suspicious is happening, you can always call the bank and tell them about it. From there, you can request an emergency lock on your account and credit card so that no further damage can be committed. The bank then further investigates along with the police to track down the criminal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you want to be compensated for the sum of money that you just lost, you have to go through an extensive bureaucratic process in order to prove that you weren\u0026rsquo;t the one doing all those transactions. Even so, it is way better than losing the money forever. If you are careful and vigilant, having an internet banking account can really help you resolve such issues, thus negating the bad aspects of digital banking. You always have to be careful with your information, especially on the internet, so knowing how to combat the disadvantages is the key to secure digital banking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-vcv81\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-vcv81\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f5dd12d9-3962-4b64-9a84-471725a866db\u0022\u003eEssay about advertising\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeste tot în jurul nostru avem reclame. Essay about advertising este aici să ne explice de unde au apărut reclamele pe pereți, și ce caută poze artistice pe cutiile de hârtie igienică. Prezentând un scurt istoric al reclamelor, Essay about advertising ne povestește istoria acestei industrii controversate, și ne prezintă oamenii din spatele acesteia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-tvnto\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tvnto\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ads sell a great deal more than products. They sell values, images, and concepts of success and worth.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think advertising is a form of art, simply because a lot of creativity is necessary in order to ensure the creation of a successful ad campaign. There are, however, examples of advertising that make people cringe when they hear this word. People have been promoting their products ever since ancient times, but the ad industry merely took off in its current form in late Victorian England.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThomas J. Barratt was the chairman of a soap manufacturing company called \u0026ldquo;Pears \u0026amp; Soap\u0026rdquo;. His idea to promote the high class cleanliness of the product was to place a painting in their advertisement. The painting depicted a child playing with bubbles, drawn in the style of that time period. The feedback to this move was both positive and negative, with consumers adoring the idea and marching forward to buy the product, while critics kept saying that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t art, because the painter had sold his work for money, which was a big misdemeanor from artist\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter this event, the industry as we know it was born. Loads of artists started to work in this field. Names such as Alphonse Mucha, Salvador Dali, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, Andy Warhol and lots others put their stamp on advertising campaigns, designs and logos. Art and advertising were like brothers from here on out. Not to mention all the campaign that paid homage or parodied well known paintings and sculptures, such as Levi\u0026rsquo;s David ad campaign or the numerous commercials featuring Da Vinci\u0026rsquo;s Mona Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo a certain extent, advertising manipulates the public\u0026rsquo;s expectations, it enriches their imagination in order to sell a certain product. But if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for this industry\u0026rsquo;s endeavor, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have all these well-known, top quality brands that we enjoy buying today. If a product is good but fails to promote itself, then it has failed on the market. On the flipside, if a product is bad but has good promotion, the backlash against it will be even more furious, so it\u0026rsquo;s a win-win situation in either case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main technique used by marketing people is branding. This allows them to create a unique image for a certain product or brand, thus making it easier for people to identify it in a crowded sector of a shopping center. Standing out from the crowd is important in this trade, that\u0026rsquo;s why they put so much emphasis on the physical aspect and on TV commercials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, advertising can be false at times, but it is merely means to an end. While we are bombarded with commercials everywhere we go, we are not obligated to buy or even try the products, so no harm is done. Instead, we should appreciate creative ads, the ones with high emotional impact, the ones who stand out and are original and the memorable ads from back when we were kids, because they offer us nostalgia from those times. Like anything else, ads offer a sense of what it was like during a certain era, and they should be appreciated for putting that thing into perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-bla7i\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-bla7i\u0022 data-guid=\u0022113fff93-0224-4b81-aa12-c2d6ff479de6\u0022\u003eEssay about doctors\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about doctors este o lucrare care descrie niște personaje din viața noastră pe cât de înfricoșătoare, pe atât de eroice. Fie că ai o durere de burtă, un dinte de scos sau o operație de apendicită, Essay about doctors ne prezintă eroii în halate albe care ne fac viața mai bună și de multe ori chiar o salvează.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-gcgub\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-gcgub\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoctors are people who treat the ill and save countless lives with each passing day. They are professionals who have been training for years in order to achieve these goals. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling sick, there is no other person more qualified to treat you than a doctor. Furthermore, do not take advice from some shady person on the internet and instead, seek out professional help, or else you might regret the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile in medical school, future doctors take up to 6 years to train for their profession and become experts in a certain medical field. As with all schools, there are bound to be drop-out students, but those who remain and learn until the end are bound to become surgeons, dentists, oncologists, ophthalmologists and other specializations. It is no easy task to learn everything possible about the human body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen they finally begin their careers, doctors undertake The Hippocratic Oath, by which they swear to uphold certain ethical standards on their chosen path. Things included in this oath include respect for the hard work and achievements of those who have come before, applying all measures necessary in order to heal a patient, not being afraid to admit not knowing things which another doctor may know, to treat patients as human beings and respect their privacy etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne look at this oath is enough for anyone to realize what a huge task lies ahead of these special people. They dedicate their lives for others, they know what it means to truly be human and they know how to treat people with respect and patience. Of course, they are also human and they are bound to have their fair share of mistakes. There can also be bad doctors who got through med school by bribing the right people. Make sure to ask around about a certain doctor before deciding to pay them a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis becomes especially important when searching for a surgeon who\u0026rsquo;s going to make a sensitive operation. There have been countless malpractice cases all around the world, so your best bet in case of a surgeon is to search for someone who\u0026rsquo;s renowned for their fineness, care and precision. Do not go to someone who is still in the practice stages, even if they are being supervised and are cheaper. Sure, all great surgeons had to start somewhere, but for important operations such as brain or heart surgery, it\u0026rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll in all, as a profession, the medical field is to be admired because it helps humankind. It may have its fair share of rotten apples, but that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop you from admiring people who actually put effort into their profession.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShow them the respect they deserve and never hesitate to contact these specialists whenever you feel ill. You have absolutely nothing to lose, only health to gain, and health is one of the most important gifts anyone can have.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about economy, money, digital banking, advertising, doctors","MetaDescription":"Essay about economics este o lucrare care ne dă câteva detalii despre una dintre cele mai importante științe ale timpurilor noastre, economia.
