Având în vizor Africa de Sud, Essay about Nelson Mandela ne dă un caz concret, unde simțul dreptății, pasiunea și perseverența s-au dovedit mai presus decât orice formă de opresiune. Essay about Nelson Mandela este o lucrare care ne arată faptul că eroii apar din cele mai neașteptate locuri, în cele mai neprielnice momente, dar actiunile și faptele lor afectează lumea în cele mai neașteptate moduri, ca în final să fie pentru totdeauna scrise în istorie.</span></p><h3 id="heading-j99lu" title="ID: heading-j99lu"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay</span></h3><p>Heroes are people who save others without thinking too much of themselves. That is one of the traits that Nelson Mandela had - he was a hero. Known also by his nicknames: Madiba, Tata, Dalibunga, he became famous for his anti-apartheid, political and philanthropic movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Having come from an illiterate family, hopes of him becoming someone noticeable were low, but despite this prejudice, he is now known as one of the world&rsquo;s greatest heroes and liberator of South Africa. Nelson attended law school and was the only black person in his entire class due to the racial conflicts in the region. He was starting to become annoyed by the racial prejudices so he got involved in political causes to make things better.</p><p>He began attending meetings of the African National Congress, a rebel movement whose aim was to bring down the apartheid which was subsequently oppressing and separating black Africans from the rest of the population. He later helped form the African National Congress Youth League with the sole purpose of fighting for voting rights and equality amongst black South Africans.&nbsp;</p><p>A decade later, he and 100 of his associates were arrested for treason against the government. They were later absolved, but the ANC got banned. In 1964, Nelson got a life sentence in prison for the so-called crimes committed against apartheid. He spent 27 hard years in prison and upon his release, he kept fighting for his cause, never backing down. He managed to finally organize multi-racial elections in his country in 1994 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his endeavours.</p><p>He became president of South Africa in that election, which was the first truly democratic demonstration in the country. He sought a peaceful resolution after decades of oppressive laws against black people, thus avoiding a full-blown civil war. April 27 is celebrated even to this day as a commemoration of the first democratic election in the country and as a day of freedom. Nelson served the country until 1999 and refused to partake in his second presidential term, but the impact he had on the country and its culture remains relevant after so much time.</p><p>So what can we learn from people like him? We can see the importance and urgency of changing unjust laws from his acts. We can learn to be compassionate and caring for others. One man who had such a little chance of being noticed managed to change an entire country and to a certain extent, the entire world. You may think that your opinion doesn&rsquo;t matter, but Nelson Mandela thought otherwise.</p><p>Anyone can change the world, it&rsquo;s just a matter of how you decide to resolve the issues. Even when Mandela was considered a criminal and therefore imprisoned, he still did not give up chasing his dreams. That takes a great amount of courage and passion. So don&rsquo;t just stand there. If you want to change something, go and do it!</p><h2 id="heading-lgo0g" title="ID: heading-lgo0g" data-guid="c6363881-be4f-40da-912e-96d7b92e98d4"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about J.K.

Aratând câteva aspecte din viața autoarei, Essay about J.K.Rowling ne prezintă o mică biografie, concentrându-se pe aspectele academice care au pavat drumul de succes al scriitoarei, greutățile întâmpinate precum și motivele pentru care Harry Potter a devenit pentru mulți oameni, sinonim cu copilăria. Fie că ești un fan al filmelor, preferi cărtile sau pur și simplu vrei să iei o notă mai bună la urmatoarea lucrare, Essay about J.K.Rowling este eseul pentru tine.</span></p><h3 id="heading-2x2ck" title="ID: heading-2x2ck"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay</span></h3><p>Born on July 31st 1965 in England, United Kingdom, J.K. Rowling became the first billionaire book author and the first and only British female on the billion-dollar chart. She became famous because of her &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo; book series, with which she managed to captivate the imagination of millions of children and adults worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>She began writing as a hobby at the fragile age of 5. She attended university at Exeter, where she studied French, after which she became a bilingual secretary. After a short while, she realised that this job was not suited for her, so she quit and started doing her favourite hobby yet again. She moved to Portugal, married and had a daughter, but the marriage didn&rsquo;t last long, as she filed for divorce and moved back to England along with her daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Further down the line, she requested and received a grant from the Scottish Arts council in order to complete a book. The book was titled &ldquo;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone&rdquo; in Europe, and in the United Stated it was renamed &ldquo;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone&rdquo;. Both versions became an immense success for the author, as they sold out on a whim. There are several reasons why her book became so popular. She loves writing, she&rsquo;s passionate about it. She has an extraordinary imagination, proven by all of the seven books in the Harry Potter franchise.</p><p>The way she tells the stories is very accessible to children, but elegant enough that adults will also find them intriguing. Her books have been adapted into blockbuster movies, which subsequently brought fame and money to the cast as well. Her writing basically had so much appeal that it did not make just her famous, but also a few young actors. If that isn&rsquo;t enough proof about how efficient her writing style is, then I don&rsquo;t know what could be enough proof. As of now, the Harry Potter main franchise has come to an end, both in movie and book form, but we will soon witness a spin-off from this series titled &ldquo;Fantastic Beasts and where to find them&rdquo;.</p><p>It is safe to assume that this spin-off will also be successful, as J.K. Rowling has become a household name for so many people around the planet. An entire generation of people have grown up along with the actors, so they identify with the brand on a sentimental level. I remember watching the premiere of the last Harry Potter movie and as I saw the three main actors hugging each other and crying because it was over, I felt immense joy because I was lucky to grow up along with them, but also sadness because a big part of my childhood was not over. I cherish Rowling&rsquo;s books and the movies that she inspired very much. I and other millions of people couldn&rsquo;t imagine having to grow up again without our favourite characters. She has impacted us all on an emotional level. With all this said, she has all my respect.</p><h2 id="heading-lchd7" title="ID: heading-lchd7" data-guid="1ef63751-b6d2-4f9c-9e1b-b1c94c0fb802">Essay about Bill Gates</h2><p>Essay about Bill Gates este o lucrare, care ne povestește câteva lucruri despre creatorul sistemului de operare pe care cel mai probabil îl folosești acum, Bill Gates. Fiind unul dintre cei mai bogați oameni din lume, eseul îl descrie atât ca și un antreprenor dedicat, care a reușit să acapareze piața, cât și ca pe un filantrop care își folosește veniturile în scopuri caritabile. Essay about Bill Gates este o lucrare despre unul dintre cei mai influenti oameni ai secolului 21.</p><h3 id="heading-zrzog" title="ID: heading-zrzog">Essay</h3><p>Bill Gates is known to most people as the richest man on the planet and as founder of Microsoft, one of the biggest corporations in history. He has currently retired from the CEO position at Microsoft, but still remains its founder and takes a lot of royalties. He was married to Melinda Gates and they have three children.</p><p>Of course, he has had other endeavours apart from Microsoft, with the most known after it being the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, established in the year 2000. Their primary aims are to help combat extreme poverty and provide better healthcare worldwide. The foundation has received a lot of merits for being the most transparent private foundation on the entire planet. So, as you can see, the man is also a dedicated philanthropist, not just a tech geek and businessman.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what the man is most known for. His company, Microsoft, which he has co-founded along his best friend, Paul Allen, and the Windows operating systems for personal computers. The company was formed by these two in 1975, with their first endeavours in the market being different software issued for then-giant IBM, who was a PC manufacturing company. They also wrote an operating system, codenamed &ldquo;Altair&rdquo;, which was available on punch cards for computers with such reading capabilities. Believe it or not, the CD and hard drive were yet to be vastly popular back then, as they were expensive and considered futuristic at that time.</p><p>Furthermore, in 1984 they released their first version of the Windows operating system, which featured probably the greatest innovation in personal computers ever: the graphical desktop, which we now take for granted. Before that, operating systems only displayed texts and the only way to operate them was by actually typing commands and learning how to do that was a slow and nerve-wrecking process. Although almost all versions of this OS came with their fair share of criticism, I am happy that I live in a time where I don&rsquo;t need to retain so much information to do tasks that are considered basic by today&rsquo;s standards.</p><p>Bill Gates is currently the world&rsquo;s richest man, with an income of over 80 billion US dollars as of November 2016. He&rsquo;s been rigorously holding this position, with a few exceptions in some years, but he has never fallen off from the top 10 in the world. Does he deserve to have this much money? In my opinion, I think the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. He is responsible for technological things that we now take for granted. He has contributed to all sorts of charities countless times. The foundation that he co-directs along with his wife has helped technological development in less favourable countries. I admire him greatly, because he truly is a philanthropist, so he deserves all the credit that he gets, because he also gives part of his wealth to people that he doesn&rsquo;t know.

Essay about Nelson Mandela este o lucrare care ne arată faptul că eroii apar din cele mai neașteptate locuri, în cele mai neprielnice momente, dar actiunile și faptele lor afectează lumea în cele mai neașteptate moduri, ca în final să fie pentru totdeauna scrise în istorie.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-j99lu\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-j99lu\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeroes are people who save others without thinking too much of themselves. That is one of the traits that Nelson Mandela had - he was a hero. Known also by his nicknames: Madiba, Tata, Dalibunga, he became famous for his anti-apartheid, political and philanthropic movements.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving come from an illiterate family, hopes of him becoming someone noticeable were low, but despite this prejudice, he is now known as one of the world\u0026rsquo;s greatest heroes and liberator of South Africa. Nelson attended law school and was the only black person in his entire class due to the racial conflicts in the region. He was starting to become annoyed by the racial prejudices so he got involved in political causes to make things better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe began attending meetings of the African National Congress, a rebel movement whose aim was to bring down the apartheid which was subsequently oppressing and separating black Africans from the rest of the population. He later helped form the African National Congress Youth League with the sole purpose of fighting for voting rights and equality amongst black South Africans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA decade later, he and 100 of his associates were arrested for treason against the government. They were later absolved, but the ANC got banned. In 1964, Nelson got a life sentence in prison for the so-called crimes committed against apartheid. He spent 27 hard years in prison and upon his release, he kept fighting for his cause, never backing down. He managed to finally organize multi-racial elections in his country in 1994 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his endeavours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe became president of South Africa in that election, which was the first truly democratic demonstration in the country. He sought a peaceful resolution after decades of oppressive laws against black people, thus avoiding a full-blown civil war. April 27 is celebrated even to this day as a commemoration of the first democratic election in the country and as a day of freedom. Nelson served the country until 1999 and refused to partake in his second presidential term, but the impact he had on the country and its culture remains relevant after so much time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what can we learn from people like him? We can see the importance and urgency of changing unjust laws from his acts. We can learn to be compassionate and caring for others. One man who had such a little chance of being noticed managed to change an entire country and to a certain extent, the entire world. You may think that your opinion doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but Nelson Mandela thought otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyone can change the world, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of how you decide to resolve the issues. Even when Mandela was considered a criminal and therefore imprisoned, he still did not give up chasing his dreams. That takes a great amount of courage and passion. So don\u0026rsquo;t just stand there. If you want to change something, go and do it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-lgo0g\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-lgo0g\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c6363881-be4f-40da-912e-96d7b92e98d4\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about J.K.

Rowling became the first billionaire book author and the first and only British female on the billion-dollar chart. She became famous because of her \u0026ldquo;Harry Potter\u0026rdquo; book series, with which she managed to captivate the imagination of millions of children and adults worldwide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe began writing as a hobby at the fragile age of 5. She attended university at Exeter, where she studied French, after which she became a bilingual secretary. After a short while, she realised that this job was not suited for her, so she quit and started doing her favourite hobby yet again. She moved to Portugal, married and had a daughter, but the marriage didn\u0026rsquo;t last long, as she filed for divorce and moved back to England along with her daughter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther down the line, she requested and received a grant from the Scottish Arts council in order to complete a book. The book was titled \u0026ldquo;Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Stone\u0026rdquo; in Europe, and in the United Stated it was renamed \u0026ldquo;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u0026rsquo;s Stone\u0026rdquo;. Both versions became an immense success for the author, as they sold out on a whim. There are several reasons why her book became so popular. She loves writing, she\u0026rsquo;s passionate about it. She has an extraordinary imagination, proven by all of the seven books in the Harry Potter franchise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe way she tells the stories is very accessible to children, but elegant enough that adults will also find them intriguing. Her books have been adapted into blockbuster movies, which subsequently brought fame and money to the cast as well. Her writing basically had so much appeal that it did not make just her famous, but also a few young actors. If that isn\u0026rsquo;t enough proof about how efficient her writing style is, then I don\u0026rsquo;t know what could be enough proof. As of now, the Harry Potter main franchise has come to an end, both in movie and book form, but we will soon witness a spin-off from this series titled \u0026ldquo;Fantastic Beasts and where to find them\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is safe to assume that this spin-off will also be successful, as J.K. Rowling has become a household name for so many people around the planet. An entire generation of people have grown up along with the actors, so they identify with the brand on a sentimental level. I remember watching the premiere of the last Harry Potter movie and as I saw the three main actors hugging each other and crying because it was over, I felt immense joy because I was lucky to grow up along with them, but also sadness because a big part of my childhood was not over. I cherish Rowling\u0026rsquo;s books and the movies that she inspired very much. I and other millions of people couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine having to grow up again without our favourite characters. She has impacted us all on an emotional level. With all this said, she has all my respect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-lchd7\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-lchd7\u0022 data-guid=\u00221ef63751-b6d2-4f9c-9e1b-b1c94c0fb802\u0022\u003eEssay about Bill Gates\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about Bill Gates este o lucrare, care ne povestește câteva lucruri despre creatorul sistemului de operare pe care cel mai probabil îl folosești acum, Bill Gates. Fiind unul dintre cei mai bogați oameni din lume, eseul îl descrie atât ca și un antreprenor dedicat, care a reușit să acapareze piața, cât și ca pe un filantrop care își folosește veniturile în scopuri caritabile. Essay about Bill Gates este o lucrare despre unul dintre cei mai influenti oameni ai secolului 21.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-zrzog\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-zrzog\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBill Gates is known to most people as the richest man on the planet and as founder of Microsoft, one of the biggest corporations in history. He has currently retired from the CEO position at Microsoft, but still remains its founder and takes a lot of royalties. He was married to Melinda Gates and they have three children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, he has had other endeavours apart from Microsoft, with the most known after it being the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, established in the year 2000. Their primary aims are to help combat extreme poverty and provide better healthcare worldwide. The foundation has received a lot of merits for being the most transparent private foundation on the entire planet. So, as you can see, the man is also a dedicated philanthropist, not just a tech geek and businessman.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about what the man is most known for. His company, Microsoft, which he has co-founded along his best friend, Paul Allen, and the Windows operating systems for personal computers. The company was formed by these two in 1975, with their first endeavours in the market being different software issued for then-giant IBM, who was a PC manufacturing company. They also wrote an operating system, codenamed \u0026ldquo;Altair\u0026rdquo;, which was available on punch cards for computers with such reading capabilities. Believe it or not, the CD and hard drive were yet to be vastly popular back then, as they were expensive and considered futuristic at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, in 1984 they released their first version of the Windows operating system, which featured probably the greatest innovation in personal computers ever: the graphical desktop, which we now take for granted. Before that, operating systems only displayed texts and the only way to operate them was by actually typing commands and learning how to do that was a slow and nerve-wrecking process. Although almost all versions of this OS came with their fair share of criticism, I am happy that I live in a time where I don\u0026rsquo;t need to retain so much information to do tasks that are considered basic by today\u0026rsquo;s standards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBill Gates is currently the world\u0026rsquo;s richest man, with an income of over 80 billion US dollars as of November 2016. He\u0026rsquo;s been rigorously holding this position, with a few exceptions in some years, but he has never fallen off from the top 10 in the world. Does he deserve to have this much money? In my opinion, I think the answer is \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;. He is responsible for technological things that we now take for granted. He has contributed to all sorts of charities countless times. The foundation that he co-directs along with his wife has helped technological development in less favourable countries. I admire him greatly, because he truly is a philanthropist, so he deserves all the credit that he gets, because he also gives part of his wealth to people that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know. We should all strive to follow his example \u0026ndash; we should strive to learn, innovate and to help others and subsequently make the world a better place for everyone.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about a famous person | Nelson Mandela, J.K.Rowling, Bill Gates","MetaDescription":"Când vine vorba despre eroi și acte de eroism, Essay about Nelson Mandela ne dă un exemplu excelent.
