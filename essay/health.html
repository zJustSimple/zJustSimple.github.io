Deși nu este un medic online, eseul ne amintește de sfaturile primite de la prieteni,familie si doctori.</p><h3 id="heading-ku1vu" title="ID: heading-ku1vu">Essay</h3><p>What does it mean to be healthy? Does it mean to be disease-free? Does it mean to be fit and athletic to a certain extent? Does it mean to keep your diet as varied and nutritional as possible? Well, it means all of those things.</p><p>Health is not something that a person should neglect, because it affects their everyday life. From going to school or work to going out with friends to going on trips, taking care of our body means being able to do as many things as possible effortlessly. Having a healthy lifestyle isn&rsquo;t necessarily hard, but it can be time consuming. It means that a person should be as active as possible and take good care of their body through a balanced diet and exercise.</p><p>This can get tricky if you&rsquo;re the type who works on many things at once, but even then you can still achieve it if you program your tasks accordingly. One very simple trick is to walk to work or school instead of taking the bus or driving, yet that means leaving the house earlier if you have to go a long distance in order to arrive on time.&nbsp;</p><p>Diets are another way of keeping your body clean. Let&rsquo;s face it, from time to time, everyone gets tempted to eat some chocolate or some pizza. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should eliminate those foods from our life completely, but we should take care not to indulge in them too often. If you want to lose weight, then you have to put in more effort than other people, but for the ones who simply want to maintain their weight and be healthy, it&rsquo;s much simpler. A nutritionist should be able to tell you how much carbs, calories and sugars you are allowed to eat in order to keep a steady balance.</p><p>When it comes to external factors, the weather can also have an effect on our health. During winter or in periods when the air is too cold, we have to take extra care about our body. One should dress accordingly for each season, in order to keep body temperature at normal. In case of a cold, fever, or any other disease for that matter, you should immediately consult a doctor about what medication you are supposed to take. Don&rsquo;t start popping pills just because you saw it in an advertisement.</p><p>Finally, don&rsquo;t ignore any signs of an illness. It is not a good idea to panic over every ache you might have either, but if a certain symptom keeps on persisting, then go to a doctor and see if there is something wrong with you. It is better to be cautious than to leave everything to pure chance. If treated from the early stages, an affliction will not impact your life as greatly as it would if it has the necessary time to develop further.</p><p>In conclusion, our health is not something to neglect. While it can be time consuming to keep in shape and keep healthy, no one should ignore these things because they ultimately affect our ability to do everything we have to do on a daily basis. So go ahead and take care of your body, because that is the biggest favor any person can do to their own selves.</p><h2 id="heading-eh1r6" title="ID: heading-eh1r6" data-guid="5b70dae8-3da1-4f28-af55-44356a0212d3">Essay about nutrition</h2><p>Dacă ai stat vreodată în bucătărie, gândindu-te dacă să încerci să gătești, sau să comanzi o pizza, Essay about nutrition îți poate ușura decizia. Urmărind ideea de &bdquo;corpul meu este un templu&rdquo; sau &bdquo;ești ceea ce mănânci&rdquo;, Essay about nutrition ne prezintă avantajele unei diete echilibrate, și odată cu asta, ce înseamnă echilibrul în contextul nutriției.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-lz4fx" title="ID: heading-lz4fx">Essay</h3><p>It goes without saying that in order to have a healthy body a person needs to steadily balance their meals. Of course, physical exercise is just as important, but you risk exercising for nothing if your diet isn&rsquo;t balanced accordingly. You have to know what things you can eat and what amount of it you can eat, depending on what you&rsquo;re striving to achieve, be it maintaining your body&rsquo;s health, losing weight or gaining weight.</p><p>Healthy nutrition usually consists of eating healthy and balanced from all the basic food groups; which consists of the dairy group, poultry group, fruit group, vegetable group and a little from the fats, oils, and sweets groups. But what exactly does &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; mean in this context? That depends on your body type and digestive capability. A slow metabolism might make you gain weight from an otherwise &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; diet. I may not be an expert in this subject matter, but we all know the basic stuff: do not eat too many sugars and fats, stay low on carbs and try to eat things that are high in protein, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial substances.</p><p>Keeping track of the amount of calories and fats is even more important if your ultimate goal is to achieve weight loss. Fortunately, your nutritionist or doctor might have lists with how many of these substances each food contains, or you can usually find these lists online and if you buy yourself a kitchen scale, then keeping track of your personal intake shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, but a mere annoyance. In any case, even if you&rsquo;re not trying to lose or gain weight, but simply want to maintain your silhouette, you should still consider doing these things in order to achieve the best results.</p><p>Bear in mind that cheating on your diet from time to time isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, if done rarely. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to eat a pizza after two weeks of only eating salad? But what if you want more after cheat day? Well, you&rsquo;re just going to have to be more willing and fight harder against your desires. No great task gets accomplished without hard work and the will to achieve greatness. Always keep in mind your objectives and don&rsquo;t stray too far from them. Although the work is hard, the results can be rewarding.</p><p>So, in conclusion, what are the main things we should consider about nutrition? Keep everything balanced, from the types of food, to their amount, to the time dedicated to doing physical activities, everything matters in the overall grand scheme of nutrition and dieting. Stay focused, stay sharp and make sure that your body stays in top form.</p><h2 id="heading-u1fhl" title="ID: heading-u1fhl" data-guid="f8e0715e-8a8b-4694-99b5-75de3ca93767">Essay about health is wealth</h2><p>Essay about health is wealth este o lucrare care scoate în evidență importanța sănătății în viața de zi cu zi. Cum spune și titlul, Essay about health is wealth scoate în evidență importanța sănătății folosind contextul financiar. Folosind proverbul &bdquo;Sănătatea înseamnă bani&rdquo;, acest eseu prezintă valoarea monetară a sănătății, atât ca și o condiție necesară pentru a putea obține un venit, cât și un mare minus bugetar atunci când lipseste, și sunt necesare cheltuieli pentru a o recăpăta.</p><h3 id="heading-viz9c" title="ID: heading-viz9c">Essay</h3><p>We all know that being healthy is important. I don&rsquo;t think anyone could disagree with such a proverb. After all, if you want to take it literally, you certainly need to be healthy in order to work and thus gain wealth. But the proverb isn&rsquo;t literal, it&rsquo;s metaphorical. It means that being in good health is just as, if not more, valuable than wealth. If you&rsquo;re in good health, you have all you need to function properly.</p><p>Health isn&rsquo;t something to be neglected, it&rsquo;s quite the opposite. Health should be the number one priority for anyone. Health affects our everyday life, from the smallest to the biggest details. If you have a certain disease or affliction, even mundane tasks might be comparable to climbing a mountain, but if you keep in shape and stay away from diseases, you might just be able to climb mountains as if it was nothing. You might say that health is wealth for this reason alone. To be able to do something big effortlessly means that you are already wealthier than quite a few people on the planet.</p><p>I am thankful for my health and I aim to keep it for as long as I can. Even the slightest health afflictions, such as catching a cold, can be downright annoying. Unlike when you&rsquo;re sick, you don&rsquo;t sneeze and your nose isn&rsquo;t running when you&rsquo;re in good health. Sure, it might not be as bad as other, untreatable diseases, but catching a cold really makes you realize how important health is. In this context, we can also think about the literal form of this proverb. When you&rsquo;re sick you have to spend money on medication that you wouldn&rsquo;t need otherwise. So, yet again, health is wealth, both literally and figuratively.</p><p>Just imagine how disastrous it would be to have an incurable disease if a simple cold is so annoying. Think about people who have cancer or AIDS. They have no escape from their symptoms. They are doomed to live with this sickness for the rest of their lives, at least with current scientific advancements. Every day is a challenge for them. Every single day is hard and depressing. No day passes without them thinking about how good it would be if someone found a cure for them. Health would be their most cherished possession if they had it. Too many times we overestimate the value of money and underestimate the importance of health, which is arguably more important.</p><p>I think that health is wealth, indeed. Just imagining how unhealthy people struggle every day with their symptoms sent chills down my spine. I&rsquo;m in good condition and I am very thankful for it. If I ever received an offer to sacrifice my health for all the money in the world, I would refuse it simply because health is too precious to be measured in gold or any other material form. Health is wealth. Health is immeasurably important.</p><h2 id="heading-j2l6e" title="ID: heading-j2l6e" data-guid="69c0a5dd-a5df-4002-845f-96036cf9601f">Essay about Fast Food</h2><p>As we know fast food is an easy way to get food very fast and ready to eat. Today it&rsquo;s popular all around the world and there is an explosion of businesses making fast food.&nbsp;<br>In the United States you can find restaurants in all the streets. McDonald&rsquo;s is one of the most common and popular&nbsp;fast food chains. When we are stressed and very busy we don&rsquo;t always think about what this food actually can do with our bodies. Do we subject our bodies to danger when we eat this kind of food?</p><p>With my own words I can admit that I like fast food, like McDonald&rsquo;s and so on. But after I have eaten it I can tell you that I don&rsquo;t feel so good.&nbsp;From my&nbsp;point of view, it&rsquo;s bad and I can&rsquo;t actually see the point of eating fast food. We all know that junk food is bad for us&hellip; well you can get it fast but I would say &ldquo;plan your day so you don&rsquo;t have to feel bad after eating&rdquo;. I think all of us in this classroom know or have heard that junk food isn&rsquo;t good for us. But here&rsquo;s something extra to scare you up a little.&nbsp;</p><p>The health risks that come from eating so much fast food are life-threatening. Obesity can come from eating fast food too often. However obesity isn&rsquo;t the only risk, heart disease is also a prime factor. The food can affect your heart&rsquo;s health and the risk of you developing life-threatening heart disease. Fast food&nbsp;contains a lot of fats, sugars and salt that can make your heart grow weak and it will endanger your health.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you know about the conditions the animals are living in before they&rsquo;re killed? Most people don&rsquo;t. Cows are being hung upside down; pigs and chickens are cramped in enclosed spaces. Animal should never be allowed to be tortured in this way, it&rsquo;s all wrong! Torturing animals in this way can make different bacteria enter our food. Statistics from the&nbsp;US have also shown that food-borne diseases have been estimated to cause 6 million to 81 million illnesses and up to 9000 deaths each year. And a recent study has shown that a full 48 % of soda fountains at fast food restaurants contain coliform bacteria, which grows in feces.&nbsp;</p><p>Today we live in a busy world and there is often a lot going on. People don&rsquo;t always have the time to make their own food and some of us just aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;that skilled in the kitchen. But I think it&rsquo;s hard to believe that a salad is much more expensive compared with a yummy hamburger including fries.&nbsp;In our society today, it is okay to be a little overweight, who cares we have big models. If we get to fat, we can just do an operation and I will be fine again, so where is the problem?</p><p>When we think about junk food we often just think about ourselves, however it is not just the human or the animals that are damaged by the fast food. The environment may actually receive a big burden. Fast food chains use unnecessary packaging and wrapping of hamburgers and accessories. I think it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how much waste the whole word produces just by eating at fast food chains.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a several thousands of tons of waste each year that is only used as wrapping paper for food that later will be thrown away on the street, or in the garbage and contribute to mountains of waste. According to a survey by Greenpeace, McDonald&rsquo;s only recycle a measly percent of the paper they use. Actually, Greenpeace has sued them, but they refused to pay the damages. McDonalds have cut down over 200 000 km<sup>2</sup> rainforest each year just to dedicate more space to the cereal reared.&nbsp; The rainforest is vital for us human because of our oxygen exchange. When we cut down the rainforest it becomes difficult for it to grow again and this increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Keeping cattle also produce large amounts of methane that make the greenhouse effect increase.</p><p>Finally, I would recommend that we from now on think twice before we order fast food. Isn&rsquo;t a homemade hamburger much tastier than a grimy one from McDonald&rsquo;s?&nbsp;If you care about the environment, the animals and yourself, do not support the fast food industry. By eating fast food you will absorb large amounts of saturated fats, sugars and salts. It can cause cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I don&rsquo;t think that we are prepared to put our lives at risk for eating junk food?<br><br>&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="nature.html" title="Essay about nature" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about nature</span></a><a href="culture.html" title="Essay about culture, identity and music" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about culture</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Deși nu este un medic online, eseul ne amintește de sfaturile primite de la prieteni,familie si doctori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-ku1vu\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ku1vu\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does it mean to be healthy? Does it mean to be disease-free? Does it mean to be fit and athletic to a certain extent? Does it mean to keep your diet as varied and nutritional as possible? Well, it means all of those things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHealth is not something that a person should neglect, because it affects their everyday life. From going to school or work to going out with friends to going on trips, taking care of our body means being able to do as many things as possible effortlessly. Having a healthy lifestyle isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily hard, but it can be time consuming. It means that a person should be as active as possible and take good care of their body through a balanced diet and exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis can get tricky if you\u0026rsquo;re the type who works on many things at once, but even then you can still achieve it if you program your tasks accordingly. One very simple trick is to walk to work or school instead of taking the bus or driving, yet that means leaving the house earlier if you have to go a long distance in order to arrive on time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDiets are another way of keeping your body clean. Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, from time to time, everyone gets tempted to eat some chocolate or some pizza. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we should eliminate those foods from our life completely, but we should take care not to indulge in them too often. If you want to lose weight, then you have to put in more effort than other people, but for the ones who simply want to maintain their weight and be healthy, it\u0026rsquo;s much simpler. A nutritionist should be able to tell you how much carbs, calories and sugars you are allowed to eat in order to keep a steady balance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to external factors, the weather can also have an effect on our health. During winter or in periods when the air is too cold, we have to take extra care about our body. One should dress accordingly for each season, in order to keep body temperature at normal. In case of a cold, fever, or any other disease for that matter, you should immediately consult a doctor about what medication you are supposed to take. Don\u0026rsquo;t start popping pills just because you saw it in an advertisement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, don\u0026rsquo;t ignore any signs of an illness. It is not a good idea to panic over every ache you might have either, but if a certain symptom keeps on persisting, then go to a doctor and see if there is something wrong with you. It is better to be cautious than to leave everything to pure chance. If treated from the early stages, an affliction will not impact your life as greatly as it would if it has the necessary time to develop further.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, our health is not something to neglect. While it can be time consuming to keep in shape and keep healthy, no one should ignore these things because they ultimately affect our ability to do everything we have to do on a daily basis. So go ahead and take care of your body, because that is the biggest favor any person can do to their own selves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-eh1r6\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-eh1r6\u0022 data-guid=\u00225b70dae8-3da1-4f28-af55-44356a0212d3\u0022\u003eEssay about nutrition\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă ai stat vreodată în bucătărie, gândindu-te dacă să încerci să gătești, sau să comanzi o pizza, Essay about nutrition îți poate ușura decizia. Urmărind ideea de \u0026bdquo;corpul meu este un templu\u0026rdquo; sau \u0026bdquo;ești ceea ce mănânci\u0026rdquo;, Essay about nutrition ne prezintă avantajele unei diete echilibrate, și odată cu asta, ce înseamnă echilibrul în contextul nutriției.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-lz4fx\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-lz4fx\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt goes without saying that in order to have a healthy body a person needs to steadily balance their meals. Of course, physical exercise is just as important, but you risk exercising for nothing if your diet isn\u0026rsquo;t balanced accordingly. You have to know what things you can eat and what amount of it you can eat, depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re striving to achieve, be it maintaining your body\u0026rsquo;s health, losing weight or gaining weight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHealthy nutrition usually consists of eating healthy and balanced from all the basic food groups; which consists of the dairy group, poultry group, fruit group, vegetable group and a little from the fats, oils, and sweets groups. But what exactly does \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; mean in this context? That depends on your body type and digestive capability. A slow metabolism might make you gain weight from an otherwise \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; diet. I may not be an expert in this subject matter, but we all know the basic stuff: do not eat too many sugars and fats, stay low on carbs and try to eat things that are high in protein, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial substances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeeping track of the amount of calories and fats is even more important if your ultimate goal is to achieve weight loss. Fortunately, your nutritionist or doctor might have lists with how many of these substances each food contains, or you can usually find these lists online and if you buy yourself a kitchen scale, then keeping track of your personal intake shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem, but a mere annoyance. In any case, even if you\u0026rsquo;re not trying to lose or gain weight, but simply want to maintain your silhouette, you should still consider doing these things in order to achieve the best results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBear in mind that cheating on your diet from time to time isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, if done rarely. After all, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to eat a pizza after two weeks of only eating salad? But what if you want more after cheat day? Well, you\u0026rsquo;re just going to have to be more willing and fight harder against your desires. No great task gets accomplished without hard work and the will to achieve greatness. Always keep in mind your objectives and don\u0026rsquo;t stray too far from them. Although the work is hard, the results can be rewarding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, in conclusion, what are the main things we should consider about nutrition? Keep everything balanced, from the types of food, to their amount, to the time dedicated to doing physical activities, everything matters in the overall grand scheme of nutrition and dieting. Stay focused, stay sharp and make sure that your body stays in top form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-u1fhl\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-u1fhl\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f8e0715e-8a8b-4694-99b5-75de3ca93767\u0022\u003eEssay about health is wealth\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about health is wealth este o lucrare care scoate în evidență importanța sănătății în viața de zi cu zi. Cum spune și titlul, Essay about health is wealth scoate în evidență importanța sănătății folosind contextul financiar. Folosind proverbul \u0026bdquo;Sănătatea înseamnă bani\u0026rdquo;, acest eseu prezintă valoarea monetară a sănătății, atât ca și o condiție necesară pentru a putea obține un venit, cât și un mare minus bugetar atunci când lipseste, și sunt necesare cheltuieli pentru a o recăpăta.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-viz9c\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-viz9c\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe all know that being healthy is important. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone could disagree with such a proverb. After all, if you want to take it literally, you certainly need to be healthy in order to work and thus gain wealth. But the proverb isn\u0026rsquo;t literal, it\u0026rsquo;s metaphorical. It means that being in good health is just as, if not more, valuable than wealth. If you\u0026rsquo;re in good health, you have all you need to function properly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHealth isn\u0026rsquo;t something to be neglected, it\u0026rsquo;s quite the opposite. Health should be the number one priority for anyone. Health affects our everyday life, from the smallest to the biggest details. If you have a certain disease or affliction, even mundane tasks might be comparable to climbing a mountain, but if you keep in shape and stay away from diseases, you might just be able to climb mountains as if it was nothing. You might say that health is wealth for this reason alone. To be able to do something big effortlessly means that you are already wealthier than quite a few people on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am thankful for my health and I aim to keep it for as long as I can. Even the slightest health afflictions, such as catching a cold, can be downright annoying. Unlike when you\u0026rsquo;re sick, you don\u0026rsquo;t sneeze and your nose isn\u0026rsquo;t running when you\u0026rsquo;re in good health. Sure, it might not be as bad as other, untreatable diseases, but catching a cold really makes you realize how important health is. In this context, we can also think about the literal form of this proverb. When you\u0026rsquo;re sick you have to spend money on medication that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need otherwise. So, yet again, health is wealth, both literally and figuratively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust imagine how disastrous it would be to have an incurable disease if a simple cold is so annoying. Think about people who have cancer or AIDS. They have no escape from their symptoms. They are doomed to live with this sickness for the rest of their lives, at least with current scientific advancements. Every day is a challenge for them. Every single day is hard and depressing. No day passes without them thinking about how good it would be if someone found a cure for them. Health would be their most cherished possession if they had it. Too many times we overestimate the value of money and underestimate the importance of health, which is arguably more important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that health is wealth, indeed. Just imagining how unhealthy people struggle every day with their symptoms sent chills down my spine. I\u0026rsquo;m in good condition and I am very thankful for it. If I ever received an offer to sacrifice my health for all the money in the world, I would refuse it simply because health is too precious to be measured in gold or any other material form. Health is wealth. Health is immeasurably important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-j2l6e\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-j2l6e\u0022 data-guid=\u002269c0a5dd-a5df-4002-845f-96036cf9601f\u0022\u003eEssay about Fast Food\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we know fast food is an easy way to get food very fast and ready to eat. Today it\u0026rsquo;s popular all around the world and there is an explosion of businesses making fast food.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eIn the United States you can find restaurants in all the streets. McDonald\u0026rsquo;s is one of the most common and popular\u0026nbsp;fast food chains. When we are stressed and very busy we don\u0026rsquo;t always think about what this food actually can do with our bodies. Do we subject our bodies to danger when we eat this kind of food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith my own words I can admit that I like fast food, like McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and so on. But after I have eaten it I can tell you that I don\u0026rsquo;t feel so good.\u0026nbsp;From my\u0026nbsp;point of view, it\u0026rsquo;s bad and I can\u0026rsquo;t actually see the point of eating fast food. We all know that junk food is bad for us\u0026hellip; well you can get it fast but I would say \u0026ldquo;plan your day so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to feel bad after eating\u0026rdquo;. I think all of us in this classroom know or have heard that junk food isn\u0026rsquo;t good for us. But here\u0026rsquo;s something extra to scare you up a little.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe health risks that come from eating so much fast food are life-threatening. Obesity can come from eating fast food too often. However obesity isn\u0026rsquo;t the only risk, heart disease is also a prime factor. The food can affect your heart\u0026rsquo;s health and the risk of you developing life-threatening heart disease. Fast food\u0026nbsp;contains a lot of fats, sugars and salt that can make your heart grow weak and it will endanger your health.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you know about the conditions the animals are living in before they\u0026rsquo;re killed? Most people don\u0026rsquo;t. Cows are being hung upside down; pigs and chickens are cramped in enclosed spaces. Animal should never be allowed to be tortured in this way, it\u0026rsquo;s all wrong! Torturing animals in this way can make different bacteria enter our food. Statistics from the\u0026nbsp;US have also shown that food-borne diseases have been estimated to cause 6 million to 81 million illnesses and up to 9000 deaths each year. And a recent study has shown that a full 48 % of soda fountains at fast food restaurants contain coliform bacteria, which grows in feces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we live in a busy world and there is often a lot going on. People don\u0026rsquo;t always have the time to make their own food and some of us just aren\u0026rsquo;t\u0026nbsp;that skilled in the kitchen. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that a salad is much more expensive compared with a yummy hamburger including fries.\u0026nbsp;In our society today, it is okay to be a little overweight, who cares we have big models. If we get to fat, we can just do an operation and I will be fine again, so where is the problem?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we think about junk food we often just think about ourselves, however it is not just the human or the animals that are damaged by the fast food. The environment may actually receive a big burden. Fast food chains use unnecessary packaging and wrapping of hamburgers and accessories. I think it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine how much waste the whole word produces just by eating at fast food chains.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a several thousands of tons of waste each year that is only used as wrapping paper for food that later will be thrown away on the street, or in the garbage and contribute to mountains of waste. According to a survey by Greenpeace, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s only recycle a measly percent of the paper they use. Actually, Greenpeace has sued them, but they refused to pay the damages. McDonalds have cut down over 200 000 km\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e rainforest each year just to dedicate more space to the cereal reared.\u0026nbsp; The rainforest is vital for us human because of our oxygen exchange. When we cut down the rainforest it becomes difficult for it to grow again and this increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Keeping cattle also produce large amounts of methane that make the greenhouse effect increase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I would recommend that we from now on think twice before we order fast food. Isn\u0026rsquo;t a homemade hamburger much tastier than a grimy one from McDonald\u0026rsquo;s?\u0026nbsp;If you care about the environment, the animals and yourself, do not support the fast food industry. By eating fast food you will absorb large amounts of saturated fats, sugars and salts. It can cause cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t think that we are prepared to put our lives at risk for eating junk food?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about health","MetaDescription":"Fie că este un exercițiu la test, la examen sau pur și simplu o curiozitate personală, Essay about health ne poate oferi un răspuns la întrebări cum ar fi ”ce înseamna să fii sănătos?„ sau ”cum poți s (…)","IsPublished":true,"RedirectToLogin":false},"localizations":{"SearchContentPlaceholder":"Caută în Essay Examples","PreviousPage":"Anterior","NextPage":"Următoarea","FavouriteDeselect":"Anulează preferința","FavouriteSelect":"Selectează ca favorit","FavouriteNotificationDeselect":"eBook-ul a fost eliminat din lista de preferate.","FavouriteNotificationSelect":"Ai marcat acest eBook ca favorit.
