Readucând la lumină câteva din minunile apărute datorită educației, Essay about education ne prezintă atât beneficiile educației pe plan științific si social, cât și beneficiile pe plan individual pentru autodezvoltare. Essay about education ne aduce aminte că într-o lume unde avem toată informația la o apăsare de ecran, educația este o armă puternică.</p><h3 id="heading-z6ad0" title="ID: heading-z6ad0">Essay</h3><p><span style="color:#00000A;">&ldquo;</span>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world&rdquo;</p><p>Throughout the years, the world has relied on education in order to achieve all the great things that we now take for granted. Without it, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to gather information and communicate at anytime, anywhere, with anyone of our choosing, no matter the distance. And that&rsquo;s just one example of the things that education has enabled people to accomplish.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, due to the gathered effort of previous generations&rsquo; education, humanity has now benefited from the ability to access educational tools from the comfort of their home or even from a device that can fit in one&rsquo;s pocket. With this immense advantage over the people of the past, it would be a shame for the youth to overlook things that they can now easily learn, sometimes even without a teacher&rsquo;s help.</p><p>For example, when talking about science, it is important to gather all the information that was unveiled in past researches in order to further develop newer and better technology, or even to formulate new theories which would give more and more information about the world around us and shatter even more mysteries about the universe. Case in point: Einstein used what he already knew from other scientists in order to discover the now famous theory of relativity, thus changing the world and our perception of it.</p><p>Moreover, it is not just science that benefits from education, but also society as a whole as well as other crafts, such as economics, art or literature. An educated individual tends to stand out in society, especially career wise, because in order to have a successful job, you need to acquire a certain set of skills that will help you in finding the path to success, and gathering skills is the basis of all education.&nbsp;</p><p>The acquisition and further development of skills is, by definition, education. Considering these facts, we can clearly see that the basis for a successful career is, indeed, education. Humans are in a continuous state of being educated and educating others through their words and deeds.</p><p>Finally, let&rsquo;s not forget the most basic form of education: the infancy years and the accumulation of basic manners. At the end of the day, when meeting someone new, the first impression is always the most important. Holding the door open for someone, greeting them appropriately and even the basic vocabulary used by an individual are all signs of the type of education that person has received throughout his or her life, and that is a crucial aspect when judging someone for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, education should be everyone&rsquo;s top priority in life. It can be the deciding factor when you&rsquo;re making a first impression, when you&rsquo;re trying to get your dream job and even when you&rsquo;re trying to discover new things which might, someday, change the world for the better. Education is a powerful weapon, indeed.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-f5fkt" title="ID: heading-f9n8g" data-guid="6a216efe-e2df-4717-9218-64577e8acd7a">Essay about the importance of education&nbsp;</h2><p>Eseul care ne descrie o idee cu care presupun că putem fi cu toții de acord, educația este importantă. Desi văzută ca o povară de mulți copii care o primesc, sau chiar o pierdere de bani pentru anumiți oameni, Essay about the importance of education ne amintește de importanța educației în societatea noastră, începând de la lucruri de bază cum ar fi bunele maniere, până la invenții moderne cum ar fi telefoanele sau medicamentele, toate roade ale unei bune educații. Educația este cea mai puternică armă a umanității, asa ca înarmează-te cu acest eseu pentru a putea sa câștigi lupta pentru nota 10 cu următorul test.</p><h3 id="heading-1ipoe" title="ID: heading-1ipoe">Essay</h3><p>Saying that education is important might be the biggest understatement ever. Education is an essential part of functioning correctly within a society, as it helps us get a better career, think critically, make good decisions, differentiate between ethical values, use new techniques to improve productivity, and the list could go on forever.</p><p>Education always needs to start from home. Ever since we grow up, we should normally be educated by our parents and family how to act accordingly in society, how to be polite, and what things we should strive for and what we should avoid. In school, we learn how to read, write, count, calculate and so forth. We read books in order to get more information about the world that surrounds us. Education is a never-ending process. We keep on learning till the day we die, and that is the way it should be.</p><p>We shouldn&rsquo;t just stop educating ourselves once we feel that we know all that we need to know. If you ever feel like that, there&rsquo;s a one hundred percent chance that you&rsquo;re mistaken and actually have a lot more to learn. Education improves one&rsquo;s life significantly. We wouldn&rsquo;t have come as far as we are today if we weren&rsquo;t educated. Think about all the things you use on a daily basis, such as gadgets, the internet, paper and pens, etc. All these things were made possible by highly educated individuals.</p><p>It is our duty as human beings to leave a better world for the generations to come. We live in an age when we can access all of the information that mankind has left for us any time and any place. We should take the opportunity to learn as many things as possible, so that we may grow into better individuals. Education is the key to succeeding in life, its importance is underestimated by many, but appreciated by the people who have seen all the wonders that it can do. By educating yourself and others, you will leave behind a legacy worthy of the greatest humans who have ever walked this planet.</p><p>If you want to see what education can do, look no further than to the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the doctors, the scientists, the engineers, the teachers and other similar people. We need to look up to educated people, because they are a big part of the reason our society has evolved so much. There are only advantages in being an educated person, so there&rsquo;s no reason why anyone wouldn&rsquo;t want to be like that. If you want to change the world, you can do it.</p><p>&ldquo;Education is a powerful weapon with which you can change the world.&rdquo; I believe in this statement. I believe that education is the only weapon that does good to mankind. I believe that through education the world and its people evolve. I believe in a brighter future, with the help of education.</p><h2 id="heading-rkx2l" title="ID: heading-rkx2l" data-guid="28d2d8fb-7b12-4880-9367-ac951cf61eba">Essay about the relationship between teacher and student</h2><p>Essay about the relationship between teacher and student este o lucrare care ne explică o relație fundamentală în viața de elev, relația dintre student și profesor. Deși nu întotdeauna vedem profesorii ca pe niste personaje pozitive, și să fim sinceri, multi dintre noi îi vedem mai des ca pe niște paznici care vor să ne prindă cu lecția neînvățată decăt ca pe niște mentori binevoitori, Essay about the relationship between teacher and student este aici să încerce să schimbe această percepție greșită, arătându-ne importanța și rolul acestor persoane, care la urma urmei, și-au dedicat viața pentru a încerca să-i ajute și să-i educe pe alții. Accesează eseul pentru a înțelege mai bine lucrurile care le face profesorul pentru tine și pentru a avea un exemplu de nota 10 pentru orice test care îți va ieși în față.</p><h3 id="heading-jbomy" title="ID: heading-jbomy">Essay&nbsp;</h3><p>Teachers are people who educate us and help us become better at certain aspects of life. We are taught by a large number of teachers throughout our life and teachers will also have a lot of students who will learn from them. Similarly, yet so differently, the two partake in the process known as &ldquo;education&rdquo;.</p><p>Teachers and students have two distinctive roles in their relationship. One is an apprentice, while the other is the instructor. Teachers are the one who give out instruction and explain to us how things in work in a certain domain. They help us develop our skills which we will need both in life and when pursuing a career. Although we could, in theory, study on our own, the reality is that we need guidance when learning something new.</p><p>The main virtues of a good teacher are patience, understanding, adaptability to other people&rsquo;s learning pace and knowing how to communicate properly. The student only learns efficiently if the one who teaches knows how to properly explain every detail of the subject without unnecessary convolution. With that said, in this type of relationships, the emphasis must be put on communication. There are no feelings involved, just plain interaction from which students have a lot of information to gain.</p><p>Obviously, the student has a lot more to gain in this relationship, but from a philanthropic standpoint, the teacher does the whole world a favour, because only through education will we be able to make society evolve. In this sense, the teacher is someone who gains recognition for their work. If they do their job properly, they will eventually get noticed and receive praise for their contribution to civilization.</p><p>Subsequently, the relationship between teachers and students will, in one way or another, have an indirect impact upon everyone else. If a student becomes a teacher later in life, then they will undoubtedly use the same teaching techniques that their former educator used on them. If they become a skilled marketer, for instance, they have the power to sell people a product that they&rsquo;ve never even heard about before.</p><p>The list of jobs that people can get from the education brought to them by teachers is astounding. The examples listed above barely represent a small percentage of the things people can do with education. In no other type of relationship can I think about an instance where one person has such an impact on another that they can truly make them change the world or contribute one way or another to society.</p><p>The relationship between students and teachers is absolutely incredible when you think about it this way, because it makes you realize just how important the professor&rsquo;s role is. We should all appreciate the importance of teachers in our lives, because otherwise we won&rsquo;t be able to achieve much of what we want to do in our lives.</p><h2 id="heading-mx4iv" title="ID: heading-mx4iv" data-guid="1bc130c2-2e90-405d-bb91-1e3c5bedfc32">Essay about books&nbsp;</h2><p>Essay about books este un eseu care subliniază importanța cărților în viața oamenilor. Fie că îți place sau nu să citești, Essay about books pune în discuție problema cititului, concentrându-se pe elevi, și de ce această activitate este evitată de multă lume. Essay about books este o lucrare redactată cu atenție și este un model de nota 10 pentru oricine caută să-și îmbunătățească performanțele pentru următorul test sau examen.</p><h3 id="heading-ngcj6" title="ID: heading-ngcj6">Essay&nbsp;</h3><p>&ldquo;A room without books is like a body without a soul.&rdquo;</p><p>Why is it that books get scoffed at by so many teenagers? Books are a great way to train someone&rsquo;s mind and their imagination. Although a great story can be told through other mediums, such as movies, theater shows or even video games, books have the advantage of letting a person use their imagination, as there are no visual elements. Feelings can thus be transmitted more organic, without the inevitable interpretation when watching a purely visual scene.</p><p>So, where lies the problem? What makes youths avoid books? I think it&rsquo;s all about obligation. In most school systems, you have to read certain literary books for the language and literature classes. That would not be a problem if people could choose and if they weren&rsquo;t restricted by time. Reading should not be an obligation, it should be done, instead, as a means to recreate and stimulate the brain. By making something obligatory, you automatically take away the fun value out of it.</p><p>Imagine if you were forced to watch certain movies that weren&rsquo;t necessarily to your liking and that you also had a deadline by which you have to watch said films. You&rsquo;d start developing a distaste for the medium. That&rsquo;s the problem with literature in the educational system. Children are curious by default, but if you force something on them, they&rsquo;ll start despising it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad to see that despite this fact, many media outlets are promoting reading as being considered &ldquo;cool&rdquo; in order to get young people to read. And it works. If you go to a library, you&rsquo;ll most likely see people in their early twenties reading books. I&rsquo;ve even encountered some close friends who started to read even though they despised the idea back when we were in school. So, regarding children and reading, my personal conclusion is that it shouldn&rsquo;t be forced, but rather encouraged, be more open about what books they could delve into.</p><p>But what are the benefits of reading books? As mentioned earlier, they stimulate one&rsquo;s imagination, as no visual elements are present. You could also imagine a character exactly the way you want him to. You can make up your own idea about how certain characters may sound, depending on how you view them. And last but not least, books develop your vocabulary far beyond daily fluff talk. By reading more and more books, you will inevitably encounter different words that you might have not heard in day to day conversations. Start using this opportunity to enhance your speaking skills and prepare yourself for adulthood, when a more developed language is needed.</p><p>In conclusion, books help people to grow. Not only do their offer great stories, but they are also an excellent way of improving your imagination and communication. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched a movie adaptation about a book that you loved, you most likely think the film is far less enticing that the written material.</p><h2 id="heading-9t90b" title="ID: heading-9t90b" data-guid="b7336612-715b-4a11-8e8d-0b101fd54fd3">Essay about the English language</h2><p>Dacă ai primit ca cerință să scrii un eseu despre limba engleză, Essay about the English language îți poate da o mană de ajutor.

Deși nu cred că există mulți oameni care să aprecieze temele de casă, Essay about homework încearcă să scoată în evidență câteva dintre parțile bune ale acestei activități, arătând că, deși este antipatică, ne ajuta să ne consolidăm atât cunoștințele academice, cât și abilitățile de organizare. Orice părere ai avea despre acest subiect, Essay about homework este aici să te ajute, atât cu sfaturi, cât și printr-un exemplu de nota 10 pentru orice test sau examen îți va sări în cale.</p><h3 id="heading-k7so0" title="ID: heading-k7so0">Essay</h3><p>Homework is comprised of the task students have to do after school, at home. It is a classic method used by teachers in order to further develop their pupils&rsquo; skills even when they&rsquo;re done with the curriculum for the day. But as we all know, almost nobody enjoys homework. It takes away from your free time and if you&rsquo;re stuck at a certain point, there&rsquo;s no teacher around who can help you, unless one of the members in your family are good at the subject you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s just face it, homework isn&rsquo;t fun. But it does, however, teach you how to handle things on your own. Depending on what type of person you are, be it creative, or calculated, and on what type of subject you&rsquo;re working on, doing your homework stimulates your brain and trains you further. On the flipside, too much homework for lots of different subjects at the same time can agglomerate the mind and make a person less productive than initially intended.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to keep all your stuff organized, not just when it comes to homework, but for others tasks as well. Sure, while in school, depending on your teachers, keeping things straightened out might not be easy at all, but if you can keep your head cool there might still be a chance. Don&rsquo;t waste your time and energy trying to do multiple tasks at once, instead find some criteria by which to sort them out. For example, you can sort them out from easiest to hardest, from shortest to longest or by importance.</p><p>Keeping in mind all these facts, it is safe to say that homework is both harmful and helpful, depending on the tasks at hand. What is important is to stay organized. This can&rsquo;t be stressed enough. Even if you run into a situation where you didn&rsquo;t have the necessary nerves to do your homework, don&rsquo;t panic. You can always do it before the class starts, if time is on your side. Although viewed as lazy, this tactic has its benefits. For instance, you can memorize the answers more rapidly, giving you more credibility than others.</p><p>One other way of staying organized is by focusing on one subject at a time. Don&rsquo;t focus on an English problem and then immediately after focus on a Maths problem. Instead, focus on all your English assignments and then on your Maths assignments or vice-versa. That way, you won&rsquo;t feel clogged and won&rsquo;t lose track of anything that you need to remember from any of your school subjects.</p><p>So, what can we say in the end about homework? Is it necessary? To a certain extent, definitely. Is it helpful? Yes, it can be. As you may notice, my opinion on homework is rather indecisive, but that is because homework can have lots of different variations. In any case, it is important to learn and strive to achieve greatness. If done right, homework can improve your knowledge and make you a better student.</p><h2 id="heading-wl9kr" title="ID: heading-wl9kr" data-guid="19c28c92-b4b3-4f23-9a61-404af031fbb5">Essay about discipline</h2><p>Fie că suntem la școală, la lucru, sau în orice altă situație, Essay about discipline ne arată că disciplina este necesară. Desi impunerea în mod excesiv de-a lungul anilor i-a adus o imagine proastă și o stigmatizare în rândul tinerilor, Essay about discipline ne arată că disciplina este un element indispensabil în viața secolului XXI, atât pentru siguranța și binestarea noastră, cât și pentru șanse de succes mai mari în aproape orice activitate.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-b19ip" title="ID: heading-b19ip">Essay</h3><p>Discipline is necessary in every situation that people encounter during their lifetime. Discipline is a sign of an educated mind and an individual who has managed to control all of their emotions in favour of self-control. Even the most sought human right, which is freedom, requires high levels of discipline, because freedom means to be able to do whatever you want as long as you don&rsquo;t restrict or hurt others.</p><p>As with all forms of education, discipline should be first learned at home at a very young age. Some might not agree, but I think that discipline is necessary in everything, even if it means to set certain restrictions for ourselves. In school, for example, you cannot have a productive class without discipline. If everyone was doing something entirely different instead of listening to the teacher and paying attention to the lesson, the class would be a complete waste of time and we would have gained absolutely no knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, if people aren&rsquo;t disciplined during a debate, then the debate can turn into an argument and stray far off from an otherwise civil conversation from which we can view different perspectives regarding certain topics. In these cases, listening to your opponent&rsquo;s opinion and giving good counter-arguments without reducing the conversation to insults based on emotions is necessary. It is a sign of respect, self-control and, above all, discipline. Up until now it seems that this topic is only related to knowledge and human interaction, but there are situations where discipline matters even if there are no other nearby humans involved.</p><p>As an example, driving can be very dangerous if someone doesn&rsquo;t respect the laws of the road. No other human beings are involved directly in the way someone drives, but if the person is undisciplined and reckless, the outcomes can be quite terrifying. Even though I don&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s licence yet, it isn&rsquo;t hard to see that keeping a cool head and respecting certain rules regarding traffic is the key to yours and other people&rsquo;s safety. Imagine if everyone drove like a madman, imagine if everyone ignored stop signs and red lights. It would be a complete disaster. That is why discipline is important even in activities that don&rsquo;t require direct interaction with other humans.</p><p>Discipline can bring someone a lot of success in life. Knowing how to act accordingly in any given situation is the key to social interaction, managing schedules, keeping appointments, getting things organized, planning certain events and so on. Ask any successful person what quality made them who they are today and they will most likely answer something along the lines of &ldquo;hard work, critical thinking and discipline&rdquo;. Although taught by others at first, we have to learn discipline ourselves down the line, because further in life we have to learn to educate ourselves so that we may not need to depend on others all the time. Those are only a few reasons why discipline is important, so let&rsquo;s not ignore its importance any further.</p><h2 id="heading-gx3fp" title="ID: heading-gx3fp" data-guid="cb944a17-f759-4162-a6a0-5fac6d48f024">Essay about knowledge</h2><p>Essay about knowledge este o lucrare care ne povestește despre una dintre cele mai valoroase resurse pe care o avem ca specie inteligentă, informația. Desi pare ceva trivial, Essay about knowledge ne arată cum de-a lungul istoriei informația a progresat de la un privilegiu al elitei, la o comoditate strict regulată de partidele politice până la accesul liber de oriunde și oricând pe care-l avem astăzi.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-n1oy5" title="ID: heading-n1oy5">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Knowledge is power.&rdquo;</p><p>What is the most accessed website on the internet ever? It&rsquo;s a simple search engine. This shows how important knowledge is for humans. Today, we have all sorts of options for learning new things or rediscovering old things which we may have forgotten, but it wasn&rsquo;t always like that, even though people have always strived to know more and more about everything that surrounds us.</p><p>Having access to a library in ancient history and in the dark ages wasn&rsquo;t easy. Only political figures, high ranking church staff and scholars had access to such a privilege. In totalitarian regimes, though everyone had access to information, it was either altered or censored to fit the party&rsquo;s good image and narrative. Luckily, today it&rsquo;s nothing like that anymore. Anyone can have access to information, whether it&rsquo;s from libraries or the internet.</p><p>The thirst for knowledge is present in humans even from fragile ages. Think back when you were young and you kept asking your parents all sorts of questions. I have never met a child who wasn&rsquo;t curious about the world surrounding them, and that is exactly how it should be. Don&rsquo;t stagnate on the level on which you are currently, instead strive for more knowledge, try to learn as many things as you can.</p><p>Knowing things isn&rsquo;t just for fun or for praising one&rsquo;s self, but about growth and having advantages in society that would otherwise be inaccessible. For example, while looking for a job, you might lose the position if another candidate knows more stuff related to the field than you do. Even having other skills that don&rsquo;t necessarily fit the job posting can still be an advantage, because you never know when your attributes might come in handy. Having extra knowledge could even guarantee you higher respect from others.</p><p>Think about professors and teachers. Think about how much they know and how much they are willing to share with others. They are aware of the fact that knowledge is a powerful weapon with which you can change the world. That&rsquo;s why they do what they do, to improve other people&rsquo;s lives and help them manage their own lives on this ever-evolving planet. But don&rsquo;t make the mistake of overestimating or underestimating someone. We can all learn from each other.</p><p>I might know things that you don&rsquo;t know and vice versa. Instead of criticising, we should all be willing to hear out what others have to offer and assimilate the information. Surprises come from where you least expect them.</p><p>Cherish knowledge, for it will push you higher. Praise knowledge, for it shines light onto a darkened path. Strive for knowledge, for it will make you a better person. I guess the old saying is as true as it can get. Knowledge definitely is power.</p><h2 id="heading-4fiax" title="ID: heading-4fiax" data-guid="ae33ae6e-f81f-4d7d-af87-21e553a3579e">Essay about free time</h2><p>Essay about free time reprezintă un exemplu de eseu în limba engleză despre petrecerea timpului liber.

Read a book.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Time is a valuable resource, so making sure we use it efficiently should be the top priority for anyone. Organizing our school tasks, duties and work time is essential so that we can have enough leisure in order to engage in activities that we enjoy. Yes, finding time to loosen up and calm your nerves is just as important as finding time to be productive.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">During my free time I enjoy engaging in my favourite hobbies: reading books, playing video games, going out with friends and listening to music. This may seem like wasting time, but in actuality, it helps me a lot. Reading helps me gather new information and delve into different worlds using my imagination, playing video games helps my hand-eye coordination, logical thinking and reflexes, while going out with friends can present a whole lot more opportunities, such as meeting new people, making memories that will be forever cherished and letting off some steam after a hard day.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">After going through such activities and getting enough sleep I can finally feel fresh again and start doing my tasks accordingly. Have you ever tried working whilst stressed and tired? You won&rsquo;t be too productive doing it like that, so be sure to spend your free time properly. Do not waste your free time by staying in bed all day and doing nothing else, otherwise you&rsquo;ve done nothing but gain even more stress and regret for not profiting off spare time. In case you get a vacation, be sure to do something out of the ordinary, such as traveling to a new place. New experiences can vastly improve one&rsquo;s productivity and happiness.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">What have we learned thus far? Managing time is crucial to maintaining a healthy, productive and stress-free lifestyle. Choosing what type of activities you&rsquo;re going to do should depend on your own preference, but also on their usefulness. In case of not knowing what your favourite hobbies are, you can always experiment with different stuff until you find what is right for you.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">As an endnote I would like to leave you with this inspirational quote by Tony Schwartz, journalist and book author: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible to move from one activity to the next at blinding speed and be reflective at the same time. The more complex and demanding the work we do, the wider, deeper and longer the perspective we require to do it well. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to do that when we create no white space in our lives.&rdquo;</span></p><h2 id="heading-03voo" title="ID: heading-03voo" data-guid="7fb64e8f-41dd-4ae3-b658-51d0c608d1dd"><span style="color:windowtext;">Essay about high school</span></h2><p>Essay about high school reprezintă un material util elevilor care studiază limba engleză și care au de redactat eseuri pe diferite teme pentru această materie.

Though that may be subjective depending on each individual&rsquo;s experience, it is hard to disprove such an opinion. Some might say that university is the best, but the time period that comes before it is no slouch either.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">The early transition from childhood to adolescence begins when high school starts. You start noticing a lot of changes all around you. You are no longer regarded as a child, but as a young adult, thus people are starting to take you slightly more seriously. You begin to feel butterflies in your stomach, the first sign of love. You will encounter all sorts of people and you will notice that the kids you grew up with are also starting to change, some for the better, others for the worse.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Slowly, the whole world around you starts to change. Your first worries will settle in, as you try to integrate into as many groups as possible and as you meet your new teachers and your new learning program. New school subjects will be introduced to you, some of them to your liking, while others not so much. You finally start understanding economics, psychology, logic, philosophy and sociology, which were unfamiliar subjects up to this point. A new life begins, a new journey starts.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">In this fragile transition period, there are, however, things that high school doesn&rsquo;t accomplish very well. For a start, high school doesn&rsquo;t teach you how to manage a bank account, taxes or what documents you need in order to buy a house or a car, not even how to act and what to say at an interview. This is really concerning when you consider the fact that you&rsquo;re transitioning into adulthood and thus you need to know these things. Luckily, university will remedy these issues, but it would&rsquo;ve been nice to know these things beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Furthermore, many people come out of high school not knowing what college or career path they want to pursue. This is due to the lack of conciliation classes that are supposed to help the youth. But alas, the positives outweigh the negatives when it comes to high school. You are young, you&rsquo;re starting to enjoy life at its fullest and you&rsquo;re beginning to understand what it truly means to have friends and acquaintances. You might be disappointed from time to time, but this is exactly how you will learn to identify people you can and can&rsquo;t trust in the future.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">In conclusion, high school is a period of evolution in any human&rsquo;s life. Though not perfect for guaranteeing 100% efficiency in the real world, it is still an essential stepping stone into maturity. Nevertheless, don&rsquo;t ignore going to university for further exploration about how society, the economy and other things function when you&rsquo;re an adult.</span></p><h2 id="heading-fygxx" title="ID: heading-fygxx" data-guid="fc2b7ae5-efeb-47fc-bb72-b525b81d6ef3"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about a memorable moment</span></h2><p><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about a memorable event este o lucrare care discută despre o experiență familiară pentru toți dar care la fiecare individ ia o formă diferită.

I felt so many things changed so radically in a single day. Sure, the first day of school, the first day of the first grade is also very memorable, but we are just simple children at that point, there aren&rsquo;t many things that change so much in our life at that time. But high school is where our slow transition into adulthood begins.</p><p>It was a cold, rainy, autumn day in September. The ceremony started early in the morning, all of us gathered in the high school yard to witness the principal&rsquo;s speech. He mainly addressed the first year students, who were new to this advanced form of an educational system. Although very similar to gymnasium, you could tell that some things were going to be different even from that first day. Getting ready for that day was a very long process. Ever since the end of summer was close, I was already thinking about how that day would go down. I don&rsquo;t remember having so many emotions and thoughts about the start of an academic year as I had on my first day of high school.</p><p>Even though, technically, I wasn&rsquo;t yet ready for high school life, I somehow knew that this was going to be a very different thing from what I was used to. I think we have all seen movies with or about teenagers before entering high school, and they might have possibly influenced us and gave us an idea about how it was going to be. To be fair, even with those, my perception up until that point was a little different. I used to view teenagers as people who were dreamy, but already had life figured out. I was wrong. Even now, as I am writing this, I am still confused about what I am going to do with my life.</p><p>After the ceremony, I went to the classroom where I met all of my classmates and our main teacher. We introduced ourselves, some more emotional and hesitant than others. I think it was a frightful day for most of us, as we did not know what to expect, but it turned out that we would get along very well. In fact, most of us have formed friendships that I think will last even way after high school will be over. So far, it has been a pleasant experience, and I cherish the day that this all started. After we received our textbooks, we all went home. Although I was still emotional even then, I was eager to actually start learning and meet my new teachers.</p><p>To me, this is the most memorable event in high school. As they say, you never forget the beginning. This was the beginning of a wonderful period of my life and I hope that me and everyone in my class get to experience something even more beautiful and exciting after we all finish high school.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-xygm8" title="ID: heading-xygm8" data-guid="1546d667-2078-44cb-ba2b-75b1529b870f">Essay about taking a gap year</h2><p>Dacă ai stat până acuma să te gândești ce să faci după ce termini liceul, Essay about taking a gap year este o lucrare care s-ar putea să-ți dea de gândit.

I certainly feel this way, and I think most teenagers share the same feeling. Should we go straight to university after graduating? Should we go find a low paying job? I have no idea and chances are you don&rsquo;t either if you&rsquo;re my age.</p><p>For some time now I&rsquo;ve been thinking about taking a gap year between high school and university? Why? Well, there are several different reasons why I think this is a good choice. Up until this point, I still don&rsquo;t feel ready for adult life. It&rsquo;s sad, but it&rsquo;s to be expected from our age group. Why not take some time off for self-improvement? There&rsquo;s no denying that universities&rsquo; programs are quite different from high school, and as a result you might feel that you&rsquo;re becoming more stressed and will start doubting yourself.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of my older friends complain about how they&rsquo;re expected to already know certain things in university, things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily taught in our curriculum. I was thinking to take some time off in order to improve myself, my skills, and my knowledge about the academic speech and probably even learn a new language before diving head first into an academic field. In my humble opinion, preparing for university life is just as important as getting admitted into university. I think you should spend this time to learn more about the structure of academic courses, speech and learn how to take care of your own self before leaving your comfort zone. After all, high school has become a sort of comfort zone for us.</p><p>Another option would be to take a long vacation into a country or city that you haven&rsquo;t visited before, preferably on your own. Why do this? Because it is important to see how different places can offer you different opportunities, experiences and knowledge. Don&rsquo;t stay in the same place your entire life, go out and explore the world, only then will you understand that people have other ways of thinking that can be radically different from your own. Experiencing such differences is the key to adapting quicker into a whole new way of living. Who knows? Maybe you might even discover a hidden passion of yours by doing this. That way, you might even have higher chances of getting a better paying job during your academic studies.</p><p>Hang on, let&rsquo;s not forget the most important aspect of taking a gap year: having fun. You&rsquo;ve been stressing yourself trying to learn so many subjects all these years. Why not take a break? Relaxation will recharge your batteries and you may feel better prepared after a long vacation. The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so don&rsquo;t agglomerate yourself too much. Our brain needs to rest from time to time in order to function at its maximum capacity. Whatever your motives are, taking a gap year could just be the best choice of your life. As Betty Williams once said, &ldquo;When all else fails, take a vacation.&rdquo;</p><h2 id="heading-vohmq" title="ID: heading-vohmq" data-guid="0647752c-56c5-463d-9c2e-3e74232bc2f4">Essay about history</h2><p>Dacă te-ai întrebat vreodată, probabil pe un ton acuzator, de ce trebuie să studiem istoria la școală, Essay about history este aici să îți dea un răspuns.

We can learn how much we have evolved along all the years, so we can fully appreciate all the benefits that technology and modern society have to offer.</p><p>As we all know, history is the science that helps us find out what happened before our time.

Just thinking about all the different rituals, languages, tribes and beliefs that have existed before and how they were moulded through time, be it by invasion, immigration or war, makes you wonder what the future might hold for our current society.</p><p>While in school, a lot of emphasis is put on learning the exact years in which events occurred, learning history by yourself can be fun and stress-free. I started reading history books for children when I was around 8 or 9 years old. I remember that at the time they were the only type of books that I would have been attracted to. It was like reading an ambitious story, but instead of it being all in the author&rsquo;s imagination, it all happened in real life, which I found remarkably intriguing at the time. In fact, I still find it intriguing to this day. I find myself sometimes imagining what it would have been like if I lived in ancient times.</p><p>Why do I consider history important as a school subject? Because without knowing history, you can&rsquo;t appreciate how much we have evolved. Without knowing this subject, you will not know why you are on this planet and how your country came to be as it now is. Without knowing history, you are more likely to repeat past mistakes that can otherwise be avoided. Knowing history gives you a better understanding about how the world functions and how it was built. Knowing history lets you honour those who have come before, all the heroes who strives to make this a better world, all the ancestors who essentially made sure that you are here, now.</p><p>Basically, knowing history is all about knowing who you are. By respecting the past, we can create a better future for the generations to come. We should strive to avoid the mistakes of our ancestors and keep doing the things that have worked in our favour in the past. Learn history, so that one day you may be part of it. As a closing statement, I have to quote a video game character from Metal Gear Solid: &ldquo;Building the future and keeping the past alive are one and the same thing&rdquo;. That is the most beautiful way that anyone could describe this subject, in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-3upxc" title="ID: heading-3upxc" data-guid="b8191d33-399c-4426-822f-005ed74cf297">Why is an education important?</h2><p>We are living in a world today which is vastly influenced by the subject we choose to elaborate in. According to Francis Bacon &ldquo;Reading maketh a full man; writing an exact man and conference a ready man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>If anyone asks what these three words make together, almost every person would use the word education. Why is an education that important, or is it?&nbsp;</p><p>The education itself starts at a rather young age to develop a kid&rsquo;s physical and mental abilities, which is acquired through different subjects and learning methods. It teaches a kid the difference between right and wrong. We can say that education is basic for human development. If citizens failed to benefit from education, nations would fall to their knees.&nbsp;</p><p>Further development in our democracy would have stopped as a result of this because education is the key point to development. A man, who says that education is a waste, is wrong. The world&rsquo;s knowledge today is so complex that it would have been impossible to take up a job without being specialized in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>School is not all about theoretical facts; it also helps you to function socially within the society. The French sociologist Emilie Durkheim was a notable figure around this theory. She presented the idea that a school&rsquo;s main purpose is to develop students to function socially. Although, it is not all true, she is right. Through school you learn basic values and norms. It teaches us to be responsible, through our actions and we develop from kids to adults.</p><p>However, schools also contain negative sides, which can be crucial to students looking for the education that fits their personality and their way of life. Of course there are a lot of students that are able to appreciate the education they get, but not all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people see school as a negative obligation, and not a place where they gain an understanding of the world we live in. I think it has something to do with schools, which teaches students things they do not want to know, facts that would make them see the ugliness in the world; that people can be mean and judgmental to each other. Others may feel that they are missing out on the world. In some sense, this is true since we have spent an estimate of 2, 340 days at school by the time we are 18. But school is still immensely important.</p><p>All things considered, an education is the key which unlocks a world of different possibilities. It helps a person to reach the life they want to live, regardless of their background. The truth is, an education is just the beginning of a long and prosperous life. Thus, there may be a grain of truth in the words of Sir Francis Bacon.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay/travelling" title="Essay about travelling" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about travelling</span></a><a href="/essay/country" title="Essay about a country" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about a country</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Readucând la lumină câteva din minunile apărute datorită educației, Essay about education ne prezintă atât beneficiile educației pe plan științific si social, cât și beneficiile pe plan individual pentru autodezvoltare. Essay about education ne aduce aminte că într-o lume unde avem toată informația la o apăsare de ecran, educația este o armă puternică.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-z6ad0\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-z6ad0\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#00000A;\u0022\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u003c/span\u003eEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the years, the world has relied on education in order to achieve all the great things that we now take for granted. Without it, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to gather information and communicate at anytime, anywhere, with anyone of our choosing, no matter the distance. And that\u0026rsquo;s just one example of the things that education has enabled people to accomplish.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuckily, due to the gathered effort of previous generations\u0026rsquo; education, humanity has now benefited from the ability to access educational tools from the comfort of their home or even from a device that can fit in one\u0026rsquo;s pocket. With this immense advantage over the people of the past, it would be a shame for the youth to overlook things that they can now easily learn, sometimes even without a teacher\u0026rsquo;s help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, when talking about science, it is important to gather all the information that was unveiled in past researches in order to further develop newer and better technology, or even to formulate new theories which would give more and more information about the world around us and shatter even more mysteries about the universe. Case in point: Einstein used what he already knew from other scientists in order to discover the now famous theory of relativity, thus changing the world and our perception of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, it is not just science that benefits from education, but also society as a whole as well as other crafts, such as economics, art or literature. An educated individual tends to stand out in society, especially career wise, because in order to have a successful job, you need to acquire a certain set of skills that will help you in finding the path to success, and gathering skills is the basis of all education.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe acquisition and further development of skills is, by definition, education. Considering these facts, we can clearly see that the basis for a successful career is, indeed, education. Humans are in a continuous state of being educated and educating others through their words and deeds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the most basic form of education: the infancy years and the accumulation of basic manners. At the end of the day, when meeting someone new, the first impression is always the most important. Holding the door open for someone, greeting them appropriately and even the basic vocabulary used by an individual are all signs of the type of education that person has received throughout his or her life, and that is a crucial aspect when judging someone for the first time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, education should be everyone\u0026rsquo;s top priority in life. It can be the deciding factor when you\u0026rsquo;re making a first impression, when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get your dream job and even when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to discover new things which might, someday, change the world for the better.

Desi văzută ca o povară de mulți copii care o primesc, sau chiar o pierdere de bani pentru anumiți oameni, Essay about the importance of education ne amintește de importanța educației în societatea noastră, începând de la lucruri de bază cum ar fi bunele maniere, până la invenții moderne cum ar fi telefoanele sau medicamentele, toate roade ale unei bune educații. Educația este cea mai puternică armă a umanității, asa ca înarmează-te cu acest eseu pentru a putea sa câștigi lupta pentru nota 10 cu următorul test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-1ipoe\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-1ipoe\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSaying that education is important might be the biggest understatement ever. Education is an essential part of functioning correctly within a society, as it helps us get a better career, think critically, make good decisions, differentiate between ethical values, use new techniques to improve productivity, and the list could go on forever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEducation always needs to start from home. Ever since we grow up, we should normally be educated by our parents and family how to act accordingly in society, how to be polite, and what things we should strive for and what we should avoid. In school, we learn how to read, write, count, calculate and so forth. We read books in order to get more information about the world that surrounds us. Education is a never-ending process. We keep on learning till the day we die, and that is the way it should be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe shouldn\u0026rsquo;t just stop educating ourselves once we feel that we know all that we need to know. If you ever feel like that, there\u0026rsquo;s a one hundred percent chance that you\u0026rsquo;re mistaken and actually have a lot more to learn. Education improves one\u0026rsquo;s life significantly. We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have come as far as we are today if we weren\u0026rsquo;t educated. Think about all the things you use on a daily basis, such as gadgets, the internet, paper and pens, etc. All these things were made possible by highly educated individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is our duty as human beings to leave a better world for the generations to come. We live in an age when we can access all of the information that mankind has left for us any time and any place. We should take the opportunity to learn as many things as possible, so that we may grow into better individuals. Education is the key to succeeding in life, its importance is underestimated by many, but appreciated by the people who have seen all the wonders that it can do. By educating yourself and others, you will leave behind a legacy worthy of the greatest humans who have ever walked this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to see what education can do, look no further than to the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the doctors, the scientists, the engineers, the teachers and other similar people. We need to look up to educated people, because they are a big part of the reason our society has evolved so much. There are only advantages in being an educated person, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason why anyone wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to be like that. If you want to change the world, you can do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Education is a powerful weapon with which you can change the world.\u0026rdquo; I believe in this statement. I believe that education is the only weapon that does good to mankind. I believe that through education the world and its people evolve.

Deși nu întotdeauna vedem profesorii ca pe niste personaje pozitive, și să fim sinceri, multi dintre noi îi vedem mai des ca pe niște paznici care vor să ne prindă cu lecția neînvățată decăt ca pe niște mentori binevoitori, Essay about the relationship between teacher and student este aici să încerce să schimbe această percepție greșită, arătându-ne importanța și rolul acestor persoane, care la urma urmei, și-au dedicat viața pentru a încerca să-i ajute și să-i educe pe alții. Accesează eseul pentru a înțelege mai bine lucrurile care le face profesorul pentru tine și pentru a avea un exemplu de nota 10 pentru orice test care îți va ieși în față.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-jbomy\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-jbomy\u0022\u003eEssay\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeachers are people who educate us and help us become better at certain aspects of life. We are taught by a large number of teachers throughout our life and teachers will also have a lot of students who will learn from them. Similarly, yet so differently, the two partake in the process known as \u0026ldquo;education\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeachers and students have two distinctive roles in their relationship. One is an apprentice, while the other is the instructor. Teachers are the one who give out instruction and explain to us how things in work in a certain domain. They help us develop our skills which we will need both in life and when pursuing a career. Although we could, in theory, study on our own, the reality is that we need guidance when learning something new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main virtues of a good teacher are patience, understanding, adaptability to other people\u0026rsquo;s learning pace and knowing how to communicate properly. The student only learns efficiently if the one who teaches knows how to properly explain every detail of the subject without unnecessary convolution. With that said, in this type of relationships, the emphasis must be put on communication. There are no feelings involved, just plain interaction from which students have a lot of information to gain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously, the student has a lot more to gain in this relationship, but from a philanthropic standpoint, the teacher does the whole world a favour, because only through education will we be able to make society evolve. In this sense, the teacher is someone who gains recognition for their work. If they do their job properly, they will eventually get noticed and receive praise for their contribution to civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSubsequently, the relationship between teachers and students will, in one way or another, have an indirect impact upon everyone else. If a student becomes a teacher later in life, then they will undoubtedly use the same teaching techniques that their former educator used on them. If they become a skilled marketer, for instance, they have the power to sell people a product that they\u0026rsquo;ve never even heard about before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe list of jobs that people can get from the education brought to them by teachers is astounding. The examples listed above barely represent a small percentage of the things people can do with education. In no other type of relationship can I think about an instance where one person has such an impact on another that they can truly make them change the world or contribute one way or another to society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between students and teachers is absolutely incredible when you think about it this way, because it makes you realize just how important the professor\u0026rsquo;s role is. We should all appreciate the importance of teachers in our lives, because otherwise we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to achieve much of what we want to do in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-mx4iv\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-mx4iv\u0022 data-guid=\u00221bc130c2-2e90-405d-bb91-1e3c5bedfc32\u0022\u003eEssay about books\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about books este un eseu care subliniază importanța cărților în viața oamenilor. Fie că îți place sau nu să citești, Essay about books pune în discuție problema cititului, concentrându-se pe elevi, și de ce această activitate este evitată de multă lume. Essay about books este o lucrare redactată cu atenție și este un model de nota 10 pentru oricine caută să-și îmbunătățească performanțele pentru următorul test sau examen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-ngcj6\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ngcj6\u0022\u003eEssay\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;A room without books is like a body without a soul.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy is it that books get scoffed at by so many teenagers? Books are a great way to train someone\u0026rsquo;s mind and their imagination. Although a great story can be told through other mediums, such as movies, theater shows or even video games, books have the advantage of letting a person use their imagination, as there are no visual elements. Feelings can thus be transmitted more organic, without the inevitable interpretation when watching a purely visual scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, where lies the problem? What makes youths avoid books? I think it\u0026rsquo;s all about obligation. In most school systems, you have to read certain literary books for the language and literature classes. That would not be a problem if people could choose and if they weren\u0026rsquo;t restricted by time. Reading should not be an obligation, it should be done, instead, as a means to recreate and stimulate the brain. By making something obligatory, you automatically take away the fun value out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagine if you were forced to watch certain movies that weren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily to your liking and that you also had a deadline by which you have to watch said films. You\u0026rsquo;d start developing a distaste for the medium. That\u0026rsquo;s the problem with literature in the educational system. Children are curious by default, but if you force something on them, they\u0026rsquo;ll start despising it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m glad to see that despite this fact, many media outlets are promoting reading as being considered \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo; in order to get young people to read. And it works. If you go to a library, you\u0026rsquo;ll most likely see people in their early twenties reading books. I\u0026rsquo;ve even encountered some close friends who started to read even though they despised the idea back when we were in school. So, regarding children and reading, my personal conclusion is that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be forced, but rather encouraged, be more open about what books they could delve into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what are the benefits of reading books? As mentioned earlier, they stimulate one\u0026rsquo;s imagination, as no visual elements are present. You could also imagine a character exactly the way you want him to. You can make up your own idea about how certain characters may sound, depending on how you view them. And last but not least, books develop your vocabulary far beyond daily fluff talk. By reading more and more books, you will inevitably encounter different words that you might have not heard in day to day conversations. Start using this opportunity to enhance your speaking skills and prepare yourself for adulthood, when a more developed language is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, books help people to grow. Not only do their offer great stories, but they are also an excellent way of improving your imagination and communication. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever watched a movie adaptation about a book that you loved, you most likely think the film is far less enticing that the written material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-9t90b\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-9t90b\u0022 data-guid=\u0022b7336612-715b-4a11-8e8d-0b101fd54fd3\u0022\u003eEssay about the English language\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă ai primit ca cerință să scrii un eseu despre limba engleză, Essay about the English language îți poate da o mană de ajutor.

It would be an understatement to say that you will need to learn it in order to travel anywhere in the world or navigate the internet, play video games, etc. If you\u0026rsquo;re planning to visit a foreign country, but don\u0026rsquo;t know their native tongue, it\u0026rsquo;s sufficient to know English even at a conversational level in order to get by.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor almost a decade, English has become my second language. I\u0026rsquo;ve started learning it by watching cartoons, movies, playing video games, surfing the web and, finally, perfected it in school. Suffice to say that it is best to learn a language while young, because it is during that time period that the part of your brain which handles vocabulary is developing rapidly. I\u0026rsquo;ve met people my age who don\u0026rsquo;t know the English language beyond a conversational level and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen them struggle to comprehend and memorize words and expressions. Me and all the other people who have learned the language via cartoons and other mediums while young had no such problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe advantages of knowing a second language, or even a third one, are tremendous. Not only will you be able to communicate with tons of people on the internet, but you will most likely get a job easier, you will find it simple get directions from other people while staying in another country, you will be able to understand foreign movies without needing subtitles. And those are just a few of the advantages that one can think of. Because English is so widespread around the globe, knowing it is no longer a simple commodity, but almost an obligation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe simplest tip someone could give you for improving your English skills is to exercise. Try having conversations in this language with people who know it as often as you can. Try watching movies without subtitles, try reading simple texts in English regularly.

From there, Hollywood, the internet and all sorts of other media channels started to spread widely and thus, without realizing, it became the standard in international communication.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, even influential international organizations such as the UN, the EU, UNESCO, NATO and all others, use the English language to communicate between different countries. Orders are also issued in this tongue to assure everyone in the world understands the message.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, the English language is the most spoken in the world today. While Chinese remains the most spoken native language, when it comes to international affairs, English is the undoubted winner. Knowing this language can help a person greatly in a lot of the situations that they are bound to encounter during their life time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-cayny\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-cayny\u0022 data-guid=\u002285cc3266-8ac6-4896-a527-a83d49eb74f1\u0022\u003eEssay about homework\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about homework abordează un subiect care este antipatic pentru majoritatea studenților, tema de casă. Deși nu cred că există mulți oameni care să aprecieze temele de casă, Essay about homework încearcă să scoată în evidență câteva dintre parțile bune ale acestei activități, arătând că, deși este antipatică, ne ajuta să ne consolidăm atât cunoștințele academice, cât și abilitățile de organizare. Orice părere ai avea despre acest subiect, Essay about homework este aici să te ajute, atât cu sfaturi, cât și printr-un exemplu de nota 10 pentru orice test sau examen îți va sări în cale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-k7so0\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-k7so0\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHomework is comprised of the task students have to do after school, at home. It is a classic method used by teachers in order to further develop their pupils\u0026rsquo; skills even when they\u0026rsquo;re done with the curriculum for the day. But as we all know, almost nobody enjoys homework. It takes away from your free time and if you\u0026rsquo;re stuck at a certain point, there\u0026rsquo;s no teacher around who can help you, unless one of the members in your family are good at the subject you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s just face it, homework isn\u0026rsquo;t fun. But it does, however, teach you how to handle things on your own. Depending on what type of person you are, be it creative, or calculated, and on what type of subject you\u0026rsquo;re working on, doing your homework stimulates your brain and trains you further. On the flipside, too much homework for lots of different subjects at the same time can agglomerate the mind and make a person less productive than initially intended.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s important to keep all your stuff organized, not just when it comes to homework, but for others tasks as well. Sure, while in school, depending on your teachers, keeping things straightened out might not be easy at all, but if you can keep your head cool there might still be a chance. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste your time and energy trying to do multiple tasks at once, instead find some criteria by which to sort them out. For example, you can sort them out from easiest to hardest, from shortest to longest or by importance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeeping in mind all these facts, it is safe to say that homework is both harmful and helpful, depending on the tasks at hand. What is important is to stay organized. This can\u0026rsquo;t be stressed enough. Even if you run into a situation where you didn\u0026rsquo;t have the necessary nerves to do your homework, don\u0026rsquo;t panic. You can always do it before the class starts, if time is on your side. Although viewed as lazy, this tactic has its benefits. For instance, you can memorize the answers more rapidly, giving you more credibility than others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne other way of staying organized is by focusing on one subject at a time. Don\u0026rsquo;t focus on an English problem and then immediately after focus on a Maths problem. Instead, focus on all your English assignments and then on your Maths assignments or vice-versa. That way, you won\u0026rsquo;t feel clogged and won\u0026rsquo;t lose track of anything that you need to remember from any of your school subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what can we say in the end about homework? Is it necessary? To a certain extent, definitely. Is it helpful? Yes, it can be. As you may notice, my opinion on homework is rather indecisive, but that is because homework can have lots of different variations. In any case, it is important to learn and strive to achieve greatness. If done right, homework can improve your knowledge and make you a better student.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-wl9kr\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-wl9kr\u0022 data-guid=\u002219c28c92-b4b3-4f23-9a61-404af031fbb5\u0022\u003eEssay about discipline\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFie că suntem la școală, la lucru, sau în orice altă situație, Essay about discipline ne arată că disciplina este necesară. Desi impunerea în mod excesiv de-a lungul anilor i-a adus o imagine proastă și o stigmatizare în rândul tinerilor, Essay about discipline ne arată că disciplina este un element indispensabil în viața secolului XXI, atât pentru siguranța și binestarea noastră, cât și pentru șanse de succes mai mari în aproape orice activitate.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-b19ip\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-b19ip\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDiscipline is necessary in every situation that people encounter during their lifetime. Discipline is a sign of an educated mind and an individual who has managed to control all of their emotions in favour of self-control. Even the most sought human right, which is freedom, requires high levels of discipline, because freedom means to be able to do whatever you want as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t restrict or hurt others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with all forms of education, discipline should be first learned at home at a very young age. Some might not agree, but I think that discipline is necessary in everything, even if it means to set certain restrictions for ourselves. In school, for example, you cannot have a productive class without discipline. If everyone was doing something entirely different instead of listening to the teacher and paying attention to the lesson, the class would be a complete waste of time and we would have gained absolutely no knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, if people aren\u0026rsquo;t disciplined during a debate, then the debate can turn into an argument and stray far off from an otherwise civil conversation from which we can view different perspectives regarding certain topics. In these cases, listening to your opponent\u0026rsquo;s opinion and giving good counter-arguments without reducing the conversation to insults based on emotions is necessary. It is a sign of respect, self-control and, above all, discipline. Up until now it seems that this topic is only related to knowledge and human interaction, but there are situations where discipline matters even if there are no other nearby humans involved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an example, driving can be very dangerous if someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t respect the laws of the road. No other human beings are involved directly in the way someone drives, but if the person is undisciplined and reckless, the outcomes can be quite terrifying. Even though I don\u0026rsquo;t have a driver\u0026rsquo;s licence yet, it isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to see that keeping a cool head and respecting certain rules regarding traffic is the key to yours and other people\u0026rsquo;s safety. Imagine if everyone drove like a madman, imagine if everyone ignored stop signs and red lights. It would be a complete disaster. That is why discipline is important even in activities that don\u0026rsquo;t require direct interaction with other humans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDiscipline can bring someone a lot of success in life. Knowing how to act accordingly in any given situation is the key to social interaction, managing schedules, keeping appointments, getting things organized, planning certain events and so on. Ask any successful person what quality made them who they are today and they will most likely answer something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;hard work, critical thinking and discipline\u0026rdquo;. Although taught by others at first, we have to learn discipline ourselves down the line, because further in life we have to learn to educate ourselves so that we may not need to depend on others all the time. Those are only a few reasons why discipline is important, so let\u0026rsquo;s not ignore its importance any further.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-gx3fp\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-gx3fp\u0022 data-guid=\u0022cb944a17-f759-4162-a6a0-5fac6d48f024\u0022\u003eEssay about knowledge\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about knowledge este o lucrare care ne povestește despre una dintre cele mai valoroase resurse pe care o avem ca specie inteligentă, informația. Desi pare ceva trivial, Essay about knowledge ne arată cum de-a lungul istoriei informația a progresat de la un privilegiu al elitei, la o comoditate strict regulată de partidele politice până la accesul liber de oriunde și oricând pe care-l avem astăzi.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-n1oy5\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-n1oy5\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Knowledge is power.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the most accessed website on the internet ever? It\u0026rsquo;s a simple search engine. This shows how important knowledge is for humans. Today, we have all sorts of options for learning new things or rediscovering old things which we may have forgotten, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t always like that, even though people have always strived to know more and more about everything that surrounds us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving access to a library in ancient history and in the dark ages wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy. Only political figures, high ranking church staff and scholars had access to such a privilege. In totalitarian regimes, though everyone had access to information, it was either altered or censored to fit the party\u0026rsquo;s good image and narrative. Luckily, today it\u0026rsquo;s nothing like that anymore. Anyone can have access to information, whether it\u0026rsquo;s from libraries or the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thirst for knowledge is present in humans even from fragile ages. Think back when you were young and you kept asking your parents all sorts of questions. I have never met a child who wasn\u0026rsquo;t curious about the world surrounding them, and that is exactly how it should be. Don\u0026rsquo;t stagnate on the level on which you are currently, instead strive for more knowledge, try to learn as many things as you can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnowing things isn\u0026rsquo;t just for fun or for praising one\u0026rsquo;s self, but about growth and having advantages in society that would otherwise be inaccessible. For example, while looking for a job, you might lose the position if another candidate knows more stuff related to the field than you do. Even having other skills that don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily fit the job posting can still be an advantage, because you never know when your attributes might come in handy. Having extra knowledge could even guarantee you higher respect from others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThink about professors and teachers. Think about how much they know and how much they are willing to share with others. They are aware of the fact that knowledge is a powerful weapon with which you can change the world. That\u0026rsquo;s why they do what they do, to improve other people\u0026rsquo;s lives and help them manage their own lives on this ever-evolving planet. But don\u0026rsquo;t make the mistake of overestimating or underestimating someone. We can all learn from each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI might know things that you don\u0026rsquo;t know and vice versa. Instead of criticising, we should all be willing to hear out what others have to offer and assimilate the information. Surprises come from where you least expect them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCherish knowledge, for it will push you higher. Praise knowledge, for it shines light onto a darkened path. Strive for knowledge, for it will make you a better person. I guess the old saying is as true as it can get.

Sure, the first day of school, the first day of the first grade is also very memorable, but we are just simple children at that point, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many things that change so much in our life at that time. But high school is where our slow transition into adulthood begins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a cold, rainy, autumn day in September. The ceremony started early in the morning, all of us gathered in the high school yard to witness the principal\u0026rsquo;s speech. He mainly addressed the first year students, who were new to this advanced form of an educational system. Although very similar to gymnasium, you could tell that some things were going to be different even from that first day. Getting ready for that day was a very long process. Ever since the end of summer was close, I was already thinking about how that day would go down. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember having so many emotions and thoughts about the start of an academic year as I had on my first day of high school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though, technically, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t yet ready for high school life, I somehow knew that this was going to be a very different thing from what I was used to. I think we have all seen movies with or about teenagers before entering high school, and they might have possibly influenced us and gave us an idea about how it was going to be. To be fair, even with those, my perception up until that point was a little different. I used to view teenagers as people who were dreamy, but already had life figured out. I was wrong. Even now, as I am writing this, I am still confused about what I am going to do with my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the ceremony, I went to the classroom where I met all of my classmates and our main teacher. We introduced ourselves, some more emotional and hesitant than others. I think it was a frightful day for most of us, as we did not know what to expect, but it turned out that we would get along very well. In fact, most of us have formed friendships that I think will last even way after high school will be over. So far, it has been a pleasant experience, and I cherish the day that this all started. After we received our textbooks, we all went home. Although I was still emotional even then, I was eager to actually start learning and meet my new teachers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo me, this is the most memorable event in high school.

Scoțând în evidență mai multe avantaje ale unui an de pauză, Essay about taking a gap year este o lucrare de nota 10 care ne dă de gândit despre viitor, prezentând în același timp și un exemplu bun de urmat pentru o notă de 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-nguqd\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-nguqd\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you ever get the feeling that you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you want to do next or where to go in life? I certainly feel this way, and I think most teenagers share the same feeling. Should we go straight to university after graduating? Should we go find a low paying job? I have no idea and chances are you don\u0026rsquo;t either if you\u0026rsquo;re my age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some time now I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about taking a gap year between high school and university? Why? Well, there are several different reasons why I think this is a good choice. Up until this point, I still don\u0026rsquo;t feel ready for adult life. It\u0026rsquo;s sad, but it\u0026rsquo;s to be expected from our age group. Why not take some time off for self-improvement? There\u0026rsquo;s no denying that universities\u0026rsquo; programs are quite different from high school, and as a result you might feel that you\u0026rsquo;re becoming more stressed and will start doubting yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve heard a lot of my older friends complain about how they\u0026rsquo;re expected to already know certain things in university, things that aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily taught in our curriculum. I was thinking to take some time off in order to improve myself, my skills, and my knowledge about the academic speech and probably even learn a new language before diving head first into an academic field. In my humble opinion, preparing for university life is just as important as getting admitted into university. I think you should spend this time to learn more about the structure of academic courses, speech and learn how to take care of your own self before leaving your comfort zone. After all, high school has become a sort of comfort zone for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother option would be to take a long vacation into a country or city that you haven\u0026rsquo;t visited before, preferably on your own. Why do this? Because it is important to see how different places can offer you different opportunities, experiences and knowledge. Don\u0026rsquo;t stay in the same place your entire life, go out and explore the world, only then will you understand that people have other ways of thinking that can be radically different from your own. Experiencing such differences is the key to adapting quicker into a whole new way of living. Who knows? Maybe you might even discover a hidden passion of yours by doing this. That way, you might even have higher chances of getting a better paying job during your academic studies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHang on, let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the most important aspect of taking a gap year: having fun. You\u0026rsquo;ve been stressing yourself trying to learn so many subjects all these years. Why not take a break? Relaxation will recharge your batteries and you may feel better prepared after a long vacation. The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so don\u0026rsquo;t agglomerate yourself too much. Our brain needs to rest from time to time in order to function at its maximum capacity. Whatever your motives are, taking a gap year could just be the best choice of your life. As Betty Williams once said, \u0026ldquo;When all else fails, take a vacation.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-vohmq\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-vohmq\u0022 data-guid=\u00220647752c-56c5-463d-9c2e-3e74232bc2f4\u0022\u003eEssay about history\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă te-ai întrebat vreodată, probabil pe un ton acuzator, de ce trebuie să studiem istoria la școală, Essay about history este aici să îți dea un răspuns. Precizând că oamenii care nu-și cunosc istoria sunt ca și copiii care nu-și cunosc părinții, Essay about history scoate în evidență motivele pentru care istoria este atât o carte complexă și plină de surprize, cât și un învățător, care ne arată greșelile umanității pentru a împiedica repetarea lor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-4dygj\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-4dygj\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Romanian historian, Nicolae Iorga, once said that people who don\u0026rsquo;t know their history are like children who don\u0026rsquo;t know their parents. I fully agree with these wise words because we can all learn a lot of things from history, such as how far we have come from ancient times. We can learn how much we have evolved along all the years, so we can fully appreciate all the benefits that technology and modern society have to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we all know, history is the science that helps us find out what happened before our time. It\u0026rsquo;s the subject that studies human life since its inception. It explores all of the different cultures and nations that have inhabited this planet at one point or another. It is downright astounding to read books that cover these issues so vigorously and detailed. Just thinking about all the different rituals, languages, tribes and beliefs that have existed before and how they were moulded through time, be it by invasion, immigration or war, makes you wonder what the future might hold for our current society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile in school, a lot of emphasis is put on learning the exact years in which events occurred, learning history by yourself can be fun and stress-free. I started reading history books for children when I was around 8 or 9 years old. I remember that at the time they were the only type of books that I would have been attracted to. It was like reading an ambitious story, but instead of it being all in the author\u0026rsquo;s imagination, it all happened in real life, which I found remarkably intriguing at the time. In fact, I still find it intriguing to this day. I find myself sometimes imagining what it would have been like if I lived in ancient times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy do I consider history important as a school subject? Because without knowing history, you can\u0026rsquo;t appreciate how much we have evolved. Without knowing this subject, you will not know why you are on this planet and how your country came to be as it now is. Without knowing history, you are more likely to repeat past mistakes that can otherwise be avoided. Knowing history gives you a better understanding about how the world functions and how it was built. Knowing history lets you honour those who have come before, all the heroes who strives to make this a better world, all the ancestors who essentially made sure that you are here, now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasically, knowing history is all about knowing who you are. By respecting the past, we can create a better future for the generations to come. We should strive to avoid the mistakes of our ancestors and keep doing the things that have worked in our favour in the past. Learn history, so that one day you may be part of it. As a closing statement, I have to quote a video game character from Metal Gear Solid: \u0026ldquo;Building the future and keeping the past alive are one and the same thing\u0026rdquo;. That is the most beautiful way that anyone could describe this subject, in my opinion.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3upxc\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-3upxc\u0022 data-guid=\u0022b8191d33-399c-4426-822f-005ed74cf297\u0022\u003eWhy is an education important?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are living in a world today which is vastly influenced by the subject we choose to elaborate in. According to Francis Bacon \u0026ldquo;Reading maketh a full man; writing an exact man and conference a ready man.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf anyone asks what these three words make together, almost every person would use the word education. Why is an education that important, or is it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe education itself starts at a rather young age to develop a kid\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental abilities, which is acquired through different subjects and learning methods. It teaches a kid the difference between right and wrong. We can say that education is basic for human development. If citizens failed to benefit from education, nations would fall to their knees.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther development in our democracy would have stopped as a result of this because education is the key point to development. A man, who says that education is a waste, is wrong. The world\u0026rsquo;s knowledge today is so complex that it would have been impossible to take up a job without being specialized in the field.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchool is not all about theoretical facts; it also helps you to function socially within the society. The French sociologist Emilie Durkheim was a notable figure around this theory. She presented the idea that a school\u0026rsquo;s main purpose is to develop students to function socially. Although, it is not all true, she is right. Through school you learn basic values and norms. It teaches us to be responsible, through our actions and we develop from kids to adults.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, schools also contain negative sides, which can be crucial to students looking for the education that fits their personality and their way of life. Of course there are a lot of students that are able to appreciate the education they get, but not all of them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome people see school as a negative obligation, and not a place where they gain an understanding of the world we live in. I think it has something to do with schools, which teaches students things they do not want to know, facts that would make them see the ugliness in the world; that people can be mean and judgmental to each other. Others may feel that they are missing out on the world. In some sense, this is true since we have spent an estimate of 2, 340 days at school by the time we are 18. But school is still immensely important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll things considered, an education is the key which unlocks a world of different possibilities. It helps a person to reach the life they want to live, regardless of their background. The truth is, an education is just the beginning of a long and prosperous life. Thus, there may be a grain of truth in the words of Sir Francis Bacon.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about education","MetaDescription":"Educația poate lua multe forme, fie ea formală sau nu, fie că se petrece într-o sala de clasă sau afară, Essay about education este aici să ne ajute sa-i înțelegem importanța.
