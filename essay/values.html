Fie ca este vorba de succes pe plan personal, financiar sau profesional, Essay about success acopera toate aceste subiecte, si ofera perspective noi asupra reusitelor din viata de zi cu zi. Essay about success este o lucrare de nota 10 care poate servi ca model pentru orice student dornic sa ia o nota mai mare intr-un test sau examen, precum si ca o sursa de idei pentru viitoare eseuri.</p><h3 id="heading-tan2o" title="ID: heading-tan2o">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;The biggest challenge after success is shutting up about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Success is a rather abstract concept. Being successful can mean a lot of things. Some people might think making a lot of money means that you are a successful person. Others think the secret is having lots of friends and other connections, while some people think of success as being famous or renowned for something good.</p><p>Actually, success can mean a lot of things, depending on the context. For example, having good grades in school is a good method of achieving this. You will be viewed as a model student in that situation, thus making you successful in that respective instance. Another thing that comes to mind when thinking of success, is business. Accomplished businessmen are viewed as successful because of their skills that they put into establishing deals and becoming rich.</p><p>But most people dream about success without thinking of failure. We keep hearing about the achievements of others without a mention of their failures. The truth is that most of the times, in order to prosper, one has to endure lots of hardships and never give up. The most famous example I can think of right now is Walt Disney, who got rejected by lots of animation studios over the years. His teacher even said once that he would amount to nothing.</p><p>Yet, Disney is now one of the most iconic brands in entertainment around the globe. Not only that, but the giant company has managed to buy out Lucas Arts, who owns the Star Wars universe and also Marvel Comics, who owns Spider-man, The Avengers, etc. As you can see, that man who &ldquo;would amount to nothing&rdquo; actually became out one of the biggest corporations in history.</p><p>But, as stated earlier, success isn&rsquo;t just about obtaining money or becoming famous. I think scientists are successful people, for the simple fact that because of them our lives are now much easier. Even if most don&rsquo;t win Nobel prizes or are barely ever mentioned on TV, they can still be called successful for being able to do what few people can do, and that is improving the quality of life on this planet, be it through any means necessary.</p><p>Who else might we consider successful? All the doctors and patients that are undergoing complex surgery. It is a known fact that not many people can perform life-saving operations, because they require years of training due to their sheer intricacy. To be able to save a life from a perilous affliction - that, to me, is what also means success. To be able to survive one of these operations is yet another great example.</p><p>In conclusion, success isn&rsquo;t a specific thing. There is a whole series of factors that can make a person successful, and it all depends on the context and on your point of view. To some, even the slightest rise above their own level can mean a lot.</p><h2 id="heading-0dggz" title="ID: heading-0dggz" data-guid="e2bdc90c-ab8b-4454-bbf2-7216ea1dd7f2">Essay about happiness</h2><p>Essay about happiness prezintă una dintre cele mai simple și în același timp cele mai complexe probleme, fericirea. Fie că este privită din punct de vedere social, biologic sau financiar, Essay about happiness încearcă să ne dea un răspuns la întrebarea &rdquo;ce este fericirea&bdquo;. În această lucrare puteți găsi exemple de situații și perspective asupra fericirii, făcând Essay about happiness o lucrare în care se va putea regăsi oricare dintre noi.</p><h3 id="heading-dims8" title="ID: heading-dims8">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.&rdquo;</p><p>Being happy isn&rsquo;t hard. Maintaining happiness can be difficult, though. What exactly is happiness? It&rsquo;s that uplifting feeling you get when you finish all your tasks successfully. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you know your girlfriend is anxiously waiting for you to come back home. Happiness isn&rsquo;t something you can touch, it&rsquo;s something that you can feel.</p><p>So, what is the secret to happiness? Well, in scientific terms, it&rsquo;s dopamine and serotonin. But how do you get those dopamine and serotonin levels high enough to feel joy? That is a whole other matter, one which may differ from human to human. In fact, not just humans, but animals can also feel happiness too. Just think how excited your dog is when you arrive home.</p><p>As with all subjective matters, being happy is achieved differently by every other human. In fact, unlike the old saying &ldquo;money can&rsquo;t buy happiness&rdquo;, I am fairly certain that some people actually do buy happiness with money. Not literally, of course. For instance, a starving homeless person could reek of joy when receiving money, because of the fact that they could now afford clothes or food and other basic necessities.&nbsp;</p><p>What else could make a person happy, beside money? Well, on more common method is being loved by friends, family or even someone special. Or falling in love, for that matter. Overall, no matter how you do it, I think the ultimate goal for everybody should be happiness. In the end, what else matters? If you have everything that makes you happy and nothing can tug you off your cloud, what more do you need?</p><p>Unfortunately, there are cases where happiness is just for a few moments, while the rest of the time, sadness comes to fruition. Of course, I am talking about depression. People who suffer from it tend to view life in a more nihilistic way. Making these kinds of people happy is no easy task, and even if you manage it, their joy will only last a few hours at best. Depression can stem from a number of things, such as traumatic experiences like car accidents, the loss of a loved one, witnessing violence and abuse at a young age, being constantly mistreated by others and many other factors that can come into play.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not easy overcoming such obstacles, as many of the people who suffer from depression have committed or at least attempted suicide. But if you do manage to pull through it and finally feel happy about yourself, you could actually call yourself successful, because it isn&rsquo;t an easy battle.</p><p>In the end, happiness is the most important gift you can gift to yourself and others. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you do it, as long as you share it, because the world needs to smile more. As John Lennon once said &ldquo;When I grow up, I want to be happy&bdquo;.</p><h2 id="heading-z9ni7" title="ID: heading-z9ni7" data-guid="8ef57404-920f-4736-b894-e5e97b1d8c12">Essay about friendship</h2><p>Essay about friendship este un eseu care descrie o relație pe care o cunoaștem cu toții, prietenia. Fiind ființe sociale, Essay about friendship ne arată cum se manifestă prietenia de-a lungul anilor, precum și importanța impactului pe care îl au oamenii în care alegem să avem încredere, asupra vietii si personalității noastre. Essay about friendship nu îți va spune cum și ce prieteni să-ți alegi, dar o sa-ți prezinte câteva dintre lucrurile după care ar trebui să te orientezi, atât pentru a-ți alege prietenii, cât și pentru a-ți scrie un eseu de nota 10 la următorul test sau examen.</p><h3 id="heading-wqxdb" title="ID: heading-wqxdb">Essay</h3><p>Friends are the closest thing to having a family apart from your relatives. There are many valuable things in life, but choosing the right people to associate with may be one of the most important. From the moment we start walking and talking we choose our friends. Needless to say, sometimes our choices turn out to be awful, but when our choices are the right ones, the rewards can be phenomenal.</p><p>I joyfully remember my childhood friends. Being young, we didn&rsquo;t care about much in life, we just played all day long. We didn&rsquo;t have cell phones yet at that age, so in order to meet up we actually had to walk all the day to one another&rsquo;s house and knock on the door. Being kids, we also didn&rsquo;t care about the teenage drama that occurs in our life now. With that said, I found myself making friends differently in the past few years.</p><p>First off, buddies are no longer that simple to make. Even the ones that turn out to be trustworthy and supportive first go through multiple stages before I can truly consider them friends. The first stage is getting acquainted. Acquaintances are people that you only know on a basic level. It takes time to get to truly know someone, so I can&rsquo;t really say that I would consider an acquaintance a friend due to the lack of things that we have in common. I&rsquo;ve noticed that people my age tend to be very suspicious of others, thus it is harder to have deep conversations from the start.</p><p>Even so, acquaintances do have the potential of becoming great friends, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time and finding the right person. My newest and most cherished friend today is Robert, my classmate with whom I sit during all of our classes. Our friendship started out as just being acquaintances, as many other classmates&rsquo; friendships seem to have started out. On the first day of high school we barely spoke much apart from small talk. Things like &ldquo;where are you from? what music do you like?&rdquo; and all sorts of similar questions were asked by each of us. Nothing spectacular, really, but as time went on, we started to talk about deeper, meaningful things.</p><p>We started trusting each other and sharing all sorts of secrets. We each invited the other home to play video games or watch movies, we went to parties together where we also met other people our age with who we had fun. We started doing all sort of activities together and realized that we have a lot of fun and that we can trust each other. For me, trusting someone and having fun with them is the key to a successful friendship. Even though friendships are harder to make than when I was a kid, I think that it is only now that I have truly discovered the true meaning of having a close friend. Although Robert is not part of my family, I do feel as if he was. We may not be blood relatives, but we sure are spiritual brothers. That, to me, is true friendship.</p><h2 id="heading-s99g3" title="ID: heading-s99g3" data-guid="0275c8a7-0de2-4a9e-9048-a0d83f859880">Essay about honesty</h2><p>Dacă te-ai întrebat vreodată ce să spui unei persoane într-o situație unde sinceritatea nu este cea mai placută opțiune, Essay about honesty este lucrarea pentru tine. Având minciuna ca și parte a vieții noastre de zi cu zi, Eseul scoate în lumina reflectoarelor onestitatea, virtute din ce în ce mai des uitată. Essay about honesty este o lucrare care provoacă moralitatea cititorului, dar si prezintă diferite perspective asupra onestitații și a rolurilor ei.</p><h3 id="heading-0bxpy" title="ID: heading-0bxpy">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Honesty may not get you a lot of friends, but it will get you the right ones.&rdquo;</p><p>When I think about honesty, I think about the rare virtues that can be found in humans. We all lie from time to time for a variety of different reasons. You might lie in order to protect a loved one from a painful truth, to comfort them. You might lie in order to get yourself out of trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>There can be many reasons, but most of the times, lies do more harm than good.</p><p>A rather touching quote from one of my favorite cyberpunk video games, Deus Ex, comes to mind: &ldquo;A forgotten virtue such as honesty is worth at least 20 credits&rdquo;. Only one phrase, yet it&rsquo;s so impactful. All of us have been affected by someone else&rsquo;s lies. It might so happen that we ourselves have negatively affected someone else.</p><p>Being honest to someone is a sign of respect. The incapability of lying to someone shows that you care about them. But as stated earlier, there are exceptions to this rule. Say that, for example, one of your relatives suffers from an incurable disease. You might tell them that they&rsquo;re healthy or that they have something else entirely, in the hope that their spirit won&rsquo;t be broken.&nbsp;</p><p>Honesty has an effect upon every type of relation between humans. Whether it&rsquo;s about friendship, relationships, family relations or colleagues, having integrity is essential both in ethical and practical standpoints. If you&rsquo;re honest, you will not have to remember any lies in order to keep other people&rsquo;s opinions about you intact. Lying can lead to one or more people spotting things that don&rsquo;t add up in your stories, thus revealing to them that you&rsquo;re a fraud and you automatically lose their respect. Tell them the truth from the start and it makes it easier for you to build up appreciation, even if you are unqualified in certain aspects of life. Honest people deserve to get more appreciation than ever. Only then will others realize the importance of this dying virtue.</p><p>Honesty has also become an issue in the online environment. People can pretend or even fake lives while they&rsquo;re on social media. Unpopular opinions get a lot of hate instead of actual criticisms, while following trends becomes almost obligatory for those who want popularity. This creates a rather vicious cycle of lying and pretending in order to keep likes and views up. It has become a sort of business without money, a trade for the appreciation of falsehood. Not only does this inflate people&rsquo;s egos without any of the merit, but lying on the internet is much easier than it is in real life, because you can barely be held accountable for your words and deeds in this type of situation. Even worse, one can keep their anonymity when spreading disinformation.</p><p>So what would be the final conclusion after all these facts? Does anyone have any reason to be honest anymore? I think they do, simply for ethical reasons alone. A painful truth might not be as appreciated as a comforting lie, but in the end, the truth shall set you free!</p><h2 id="heading-o2p2h" title="ID: heading-o2p2h" data-guid="139e6347-7411-4ea2-b1f7-3972f5afec35">Essay about manners</h2><p>Fie că ești la un resturant, la o întâlnire formală sau pur și simplu într-o cameră cu prietenii de familie, Essay about good manners are ceva comun tuturor acestor situații, bunele maniere. Fiind un grup de cuvinte care este cel mai des folosit în adresări care caută să facă o persoană să se simtă prost, Essay about good manners prezintă o altă perspectivă asupra problemei manierelor, arătând rolul acestora într-o societate modernă, descriindu-le ca pe o parte esențială a educației fiecărei persoane. Eseul ne arată avantajele unui comportament manierat, fiind o lucrare de nota 10 care încearcă să desprindă eticheta de snobism care vine la pachet cu pomenirea cuvântului &bdquo;maniere&rdquo;, fiind în același timp o sursă excelentă de inspirație pentru orice elev care încearcă să-și îmbunătățească rezultatele școlare.</p><h3 id="heading-0ek1j" title="ID: heading-0ek1j">Essay</h3><p>Manners are a must-have in a civilised society. Wherever we go, we are subtly obliged to be mannered. Sure, there isn&rsquo;t a law against having bad manners, but you will be judged negatively if you lack good manners and act inappropriate. Is this a good or a bad thing? I think it&rsquo;s a good thing, because it shames people who don&rsquo;t act accordingly, while not being too harsh on them.</p><p>Despite the fact that I despise bad manners with all my heart and soul, I find it fining or imprison people based on this issue exaggerated. Violence has never solved anything. We should, instead, educate others. That&rsquo;s what good manners are about, after all, right? Some people may say that good manners are a must only in formal situations, but I think that having manners in any situations is important, if not imperative.</p><p>Manners are usually taught at home at a very early age, or at least they should be. I am aware and disgusted with people who don&rsquo;t teach their kids how to behave in society. Any form of education should be initiated by our parents, especially manners. Although we are also taught how to behave in school, it is much easier, both for teachers and students, to improve on this process if they already know the basics from the comfort of their homes.</p><p>Having good manners shows that you respect other individuals and thus you also warrant respect for your own self. It is foolish to ask for respect if you don&rsquo;t show it yourself. I&rsquo;ve heard certain people say that manners are for snobs, but I disagree wholeheartedly with such an uninformed statement. I think that people who say such a thing get the wrong image when hearing this word. They probably imagine that &ldquo;manners&rdquo; is a term used by the high society, by people who go to fancy restaurants and such.</p><p>Although I can sympathize with the fact that aristocrats were too arrogant and snobby, thus making this term get a bad name among others, I can&rsquo;t stand people who are misinformed and still think to this day that this term only applies in such cases. &ldquo;Manners&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean to be snobby and arrogant. Manners imply that you respect other individuals and that you know how to act in society. Saluting other people, for instance, is a sign of good manners.</p><p>It also means that you know how to act, not just on a day to day basis, but also in certain situations, such as when you are greeting and talking to someone who is older than you are, or the way that you ask the store&rsquo;s salesman about a certain product, etc. Manners are a must in any healthy society. Without manners, I could only imagine people acting disrespectful and bringing shame upon themselves. To me, manners represent the highest form of respect possible and they shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as conceited or vain, but rather as civil and considerate.</p><h2 id="heading-tbfrk" title="ID: heading-tbfrk" data-guid="f1a28498-0613-4544-9368-6456df6f2713">Essay about motivation</h2><p>Essay about motivation este unul dintre exemplele pe care le vei găsi pe Liceunet și pe care le poți accesa pentru a te inspira pentru scrierea propriului tău eseu.

But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Motivation is comprised of the reasons that one acts a certain way in order to achieve different goals. Needless to say, humans need reasons to obtain certain things in order to get motivated, thus to be able to accomplish said objectives. Lack of motivation can stem from a number of different reasons. You may feel tired, unqualified, shy or simply not ready for the tasks at hand, but it is essential to overcome these obstacles.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">But how do we get past these hardships? One method which seems to do wonders with almost everybody is relaxation. Go read something, listen to music, watch a film or speak to someone do anything that calms your nerves. It is also important to receive encouragement from the right people, from the ones you admire. It is important to not underestimate yourself too much and be aware of the fact that other people were in your exact same position in the past.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Lack of motivation is even more of a problem when you are faced with tasks that you don&rsquo;t enjoy. For instance, when you&rsquo;re in college, you may have certain homework to do that isn&rsquo;t exactly what you were expecting from your specialty, or it might be that the certain task itself is quite boring. In case this occurs, try reminding yourself why you are doing this, what is the ultimate goal you strive to achieve. You will find that motivation comes easier when asking yourself this type of questions.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">One other method is to lookup motivational messages on the web. This is a relatively new trend between adolescents and young adults, and to an extent it seems to be working. Sure, looking for these messages on pages from the internet is more impersonal than hearing it from a friend or from family, but it may just be what you need from time to time. After all, if the quote belongs to a celebrity or someone you admire, then it can make you put yourself in the same shoes as them and see that they once were also having problems.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">This trend is especially practiced on social media platforms, where you will find tons of pages dedicated just for this exact thing. As stated earlier, the number of youths who partake in this sort of activity is overwhelming, so you can clearly see that you are not alone in this. Everyone goes through these things in life.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">It is not the end, it&rsquo;s just a phase that you are going through and you can get passed it, just like everyone else.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">As a final statement, I think that life can get hard, even rough sometimes. We all have our downfalls, but we can also rise up again and shine brighter than ever. Don&rsquo;t let the lack of motivation keep you away from your goals. Go find it and achieve greatness!</span></p><h2 id="heading-y6h9f" title="ID: heading-y6h9f" data-guid="2e9803c4-c64b-45e7-a7ae-578350a9d27d"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about generosity</span></h2><p><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about generosity este un eseu care descrie una dintre cele mai plăcute calități pe care le poate avea un om, generozitatea. Fie că este vorba de o monedă dată unui om sarac, fie ca este timpul petrecut cu un străin pentru a vorbi cu el, Essay about generosity ne arată că generozitatea vine în multe forme și culori, dar atâta timp cât este sinceră și nu este abuzată de oameni rău-voitori, este una dintre trăsăturile care sta la baza conceptului de umanitate.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-uckah" title="ID: heading-uckah"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay</span></h3><p>&ldquo;You have not lived today until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.&rdquo;</p><p>Generosity is one of those admirable traits that seem to disappear from society as time moves on. A generous person is one that sacrifices themselves in someone else&rsquo;s favour with no expectations in return. As with any golden characteristic, though it may seem to be rare, there are individuals who shine through the darkness and make the world better.</p><p>A generous individual cares for the poor, the elderly and the disabled. They seek to help others whatever way they can. This trait is to be admired, although there are people who might try to profit off generosity. Sadly, these individuals exist in larger number than the generous ones and they often discourage us all from having this trait, for the simple reason that we might be taken as suckers. I think we shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraged by such acts, we should just be more cautious about who we help.</p><p>One way of making sure that your hard earned money actually helps the right people is by donating to nongovernmental organizations that actually fight for certain causes. There are numerous such organisations out there, some small, some huge, who have helped lots of people all around the planet through donations made by others. Even gaming companies have started doing such things. There is a site called Humble Bundle, where you can buy a bundle of games for any amount of money that you want and a part of the money that you give goes to a charity of your choosing. I think this is an excellent method of promoting generosity among a target audience that isn&rsquo;t too well known for being generous.</p><p>You may also encounter donation boxes in clubs or restaurants, which are dedicated to supporting a certain cause. Generosity is exactly about these types of acts &ndash; helping the ones who need it the most. The most recent example I can think of is the &ldquo;Colectiv&rdquo; case here, in Romania. There were many campaigns lead by all sort of organizations, clubs, venues, restaurants, hospitals, etc, that encouraged people to donate money for the victims so that they could be able to afford the medication they needed to treat their burns. Surprisingly, all the campaigns were very successful, as most of the victims have now recovered back to full health.</p><p>I may have seemed pessimistic at the beginning, but thinking about the subject and just writing about it made me realize that maybe, actually, the world isn&rsquo;t that dark of a place as we make it out to be some times. There is a light of hope after all. We can all change something, it&rsquo;s just a matter of having the generosity to give something to those in need.</p><h2 id="heading-8wtxt" title="ID: heading-8wtxt" data-guid="7ead13cd-a33c-46ab-8721-d41dae7db130"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about kindness</span></h2><p><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Eseul este o lucrare ce descrie una dintre calitățile care suntem îndemnați s-o avem de mici, bunătatea.

Being kind unconditionally is rare, so you will know that a kind person is special. It means that they are compassionate and truly care about making the world a better place through these acts. Although beautifully complex, kindness can be appreciated by anyone. It is a universal language, one that the blind can see and the deaf can hear, as Mark Twain described it so elegantly.</p><p>Kindness is so important that it is even taught by most religions and philosophers in the world. No matter what your world view may be, it is hard to doubt the positive effects that acts of kindness bring. Even small acts can have an immense impact on people&rsquo;s lives. Think about all the problems that you ever had in your life and how thankful you would have been if someone was kind enough to help you without asking for something in return. Needless to say that anyone would appreciate a helping hand in times of need.</p><p>But kindness doesn&rsquo;t stop there. To be kind can also encompass politeness, generosity, altruism, hospitality, patience and understanding. Don&rsquo;t be kind just because you may feel obligated, instead try to understand that being this way will inevitably change others&rsquo; image about you in a positive way. After all, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile, so you will also use less energy being kind and compassionate rather than arrogant and mean. Be generous to those who need it most, for even offering them a small amount of what they need can make a world of difference.</p><p>Be patient with people, so that others may look up to your example and be patient with you as a result. Be understanding with people, because everyone is unique and different. You have no idea what immense impact understanding can have on another person&rsquo;s mind. If you&rsquo;ve ever been misunderstood, you know how hard you seek to be understood by others. Just be kind and good things will follow. By doing small acts of kindness, you will make someone&rsquo;s day better and they&rsquo;re going to appreciate it.</p><p>Just imagine how good it feels to a homeless person to receive money or food unconditionally. They might be starving, so any amount of help can truly get their hopes up. Or imagine being stuck with your homework and having a good friend who offers their help. These are just a few examples of all the varied things one can do out of kindness. So go on, go make someone&rsquo;s day better. Go help people. You will feel a sense of accomplishment once doing so, because not everyone is kind and people really need these sorts of actions in their lives.</p><h2 id="heading-ht94l" title="ID: heading-ht94l" data-guid="818570f4-e7f8-4160-8309-2c891fd90503">Essay about inspiration</h2><p>Essay about inspiration, este o lucrare care descrie benzina creatiei, inspirația. Fie că lucrezi la un proiect, fie că desenezi, cânți sau scrii o poezie, Essay about inspiration ne arată că inspirația este scânteia și combustibilul procesului de creație acesta fiind elementul care împinge orice persoană pentru a face lucruri mărețe.</p><h3 id="heading-s2bgj" title="ID: heading-s2bgj">Essay</h3><p>Inspiration is the key to writing and doing art. It is the most important factor for achieving anything important in life. Inspiration is what motivates critical thinking and creative solutions. Life without inspiration wouldn&rsquo;t be the same, because we would be lacking all the technology and art that have been bestowed upon us by the people who came before.</p><p>There is, however, a huge problem which will inevitably hit you a few times in your life &ndash; lack of inspiration. What should we do in case we encounter it and what are the solutions to overcoming this dilemma? Lack of inspiration seems to set in whenever we are bored or whenever we are under huge stress. If I am not in a hurry to complete a task, I usually indulge in other activities before undertaking any assignments. If, however, I am in a hurry, I try to calm down and listen to classical music for inspiration.</p><p>Of course, each human has their own methods for finding inspiration. Isaac Newton, as an example, found the inspiration for making the theory of gravity by observing how apples tend to fall from trees. Charles Darwin got the inspiration for writing the theory of evolution after years of researching different species from all around the world. Carl Sagan got his inspiration for writing his now-famous speech &ldquo;The Pale Blue Dot&rdquo; after observing how vast space is and how immense our actions seem on this little planet that is insignificant on a universal scale. Even artists get inspired either from nature, ideas, and philosophies or simply from other artists. Inspiration can be found in all sort of places.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that not all inspiration is good, however. I am not implying that there exists bad inspiration, just that the source from which you choose to inspire yourself can be flawed. Have you ever heard the term &ldquo;pseudoscience&rdquo;? If so, then you know all about those people who claim to have done scientific research without actually being scientists. But how do they come to such flawed conclusions? Because they take inspirations from several scientific theories without looking at the entire picture, without taking into consideration the variables and side effects. This is an example of flawed inspiration.</p><p>When talking about global leaders, for instance, inspiration can also be flawed. A president might make decisions that have been proven successful in the past without taking into consideration current events and economic situations. But, let&rsquo;s look on the bright side, it is only in these two cases where flawed inspiration can negatively affect others. When it comes to arts or writing, only the author gets the negative attention, but the decisions made by the misinformed or uninformed can affect everyone. And as a side note, it is worth mentioning that inspiration may not be necessarily information. You might be inspired about the actions and accomplishments of others, without having gained much information from them. In any case, inspiration is something that we all need to acquire for accomplishing all sort of tasks and to have success in life.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-tvtwo" title="ID: heading-tvtwo" data-guid="cc5e6c33-6082-4a67-84b8-c371f1cf8f25">Essay about fame</h2><p>Essay about fame este un eseu care descrie una dintre aspirațiile de bază a locuitorilor secolului 21, faima. Deși conceptul de faimă este văzut de multă lume ca un concept universal benefic, Essay about fame analizează mai atent această perspectivă, arătându-ne diferitele tipuri de faimă, precum și prezentând o mică descriere pentru fiecare.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-zubqn" title="ID: heading-zubqn">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering.&rdquo;</p><p>What is fame? It means that a lot of people have heard about you. I think everyone dreams about fame at one point or another in their life. To me, fame is the equivalent of success. If you are well known, if you become sort of a celebrity, then you&rsquo;ve made it. But let&rsquo;s not forget that fame is a two-way street.</p><p>Once you become famous, people will judge you constantly. The way you dress, what you say, the way you act, what you do in your free time, basically your entire life will be judged by others. Your privacy will be a thing of the past. The only safe heaven when you&rsquo;ve become a public person is in your own home, cut off from the rest of the world. Otherwise, on the streets, there are bound to be fans or critics who will inevitably stop to ask you questions or take pictures with you. In my opinion, although it may seem flattering at first, it can become quite annoying after a short while.</p><p>But even with these defects, people still strive to have those 15 minutes of fame that everyone is talking about. Numerous people are willing to do almost anything imaginable to achieve their goal. How many times have you seen a stupid video posted on YouTube or on social media? How many times have we seen people pose in all sort of embarrassing or shameful situations just to grab others&rsquo; attention? Although fame has its benefits, I think people are too willing to sacrifice so many important things in order to achieve this goal. There are, however, people who get famous without dropping their pride. In fact, there are people who get more pride when becoming famous.</p><p>Scientists are one good example of becoming famous without enduring shame or doing shameful acts to achieve success. Nobel Prize winners earn their fame by helping the world to become a better place. These are the types of people that we should aspire to be. We should aspire to fame by promoting our talents and skills rather than doing dubious things in front of the world. I admire writers, artists, and people of science and culture who get famous. Those are good examples of people who actually deserve to be famous, not the pseudo-celebrities that bombard us through tabloids and second hand magazines.</p><p>Even so, it is important to remain humble when reaching fame. People tend to forget where they came from once they achieve success, and that, to me, is a dreadful act. I don&rsquo;t consider famous people to be superior to others on a purely humane perspective. I do not approve of people who get famous doing stupid things. In an ideal world, the innovators and achievers should get famous, and we as normal individuals should still respect their privacy. Some people may consider this a utopia, but I think that with a little effort and education, we could reach this status.</p><h2 id="heading-3gynw" title="ID: heading-3gynw" data-guid="d5509f26-5ea8-4960-a2dd-2f1d5dab9a8d">Essay about forgiveness</h2><p>Essay about forgiveness este un eseu despre o decizie care suntem nevoiți să o luăm în considerare de multe ori pe parcursul vieții noastre, iertarea.

Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Forgiveness means to let go of people&rsquo;s past mistakes and have a fresh start with them. After all, we are human and we do tend to make mistakes quite a lot. We are far from perfect, as there are times when we make mistakes and beg for forgiveness, but other times when someone makes a mistake and we do not even try to forgive them and vice versa.</p><p>There are times when someone makes a mistake so huge that you may want to cast revenge upon them. In most cases, the best revenge is forgiveness, especially for small, unintentional wrongdoings. Sure, there are moments when we get hot-headed over small things, but in the end we need to overcome our anger and judge accordingly. It is not worth hating someone for unimportant stuff, because in the long run, you&rsquo;re doing yourself more harm.&nbsp;</p><p>Not forgiving someone can lead to disaster sometimes. You could ruin friendships, marriages, relationships or even careers by holding on to grief. Let&rsquo;s say that a friend of yours commits the mistake of making a blunder about yourself. You realise that it was not intended, as their initial thought was only to make a joke, to make you laugh. What would be worse? To get mad a little and then calm down or to not forgive your friend, thus losing their friendship? I think the latter is far worse than the former.</p><p>I have personally known this feeling. I had a formidable good friend. He had made a bad joke about me and I felt very irritated by it. I had a fight with about this, he kept asking for forgiveness, yet I let my anger take over me and call him names. Obviously, he also got mad at me and we ceased to talk or see each other immediately. We avoided one another constantly at school and none of us would even consider talking. It was only a few weeks later when we accidentally caught the bus together, so we finally decided to talk.</p><p>We both apologized for our behaviour to one another. We both talked it over, concluding that we two made huge mistakes and regaining our friendship is far more important than that. We laughed and continued on as if nothing had ever happened. Ever since that moment, we are inseparable and no mistake takes us down. We get along so well and we&rsquo;re happy that we have one another.</p><p>What do you think about all of this? Was it not a better choice than to hold a grudge? I think anyone would agree that this was the right judgement. Having a friend is a marvellous gift. We should treasure our pals with every passing moment.

Without freedom, you cannot express your individuality, you cannot discuss different opinions and ideas, you would be a mere slave doing what your master tells you to do. For me, freedom means to do whatever you want as long as it has no negative impact on others.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not my concern, nor should it be anyone else&rsquo;s, what you choose to do in your own spare time, who you choose to associate with, what clothes you want to wear or how you choose to express yourself. For artists and writers, I think freedom of speech is valued as a sacred right. People should not be offended about others&rsquo; opinions, instead they should discuss, debate new ideas and let everyone say what they have to say.</p><p>But freedom isn&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t be limited to just free speech. One must also have freedom of religion, or freedom from religion, for that matter, freedom to defend oneself from harm done by others, freedom to live as one wishes to live and freedom of choice, just to name a few. Of course, as stated earlier, freedom ends where other people&rsquo;s rights begin. It is not acceptable to deprive others of their given liberty.</p><p>One simple look at totalitarian states will give you enough information in order to deduce how valuable your freedom is and how much you should cherish it, because not everyone on this planet has this right. Think about all the revolutions against totalitarian movements that occurred in the last century. People were willing to die rather than live their lives as slaves to a dictatorship. That&rsquo;s how much value liberty has for the individual.</p><p>Just imagine a world where you wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to speak against oppression or other forms of cruelty. Imagine being sent to prison for minor offenses, such as jokes. Think about how it would be to be put in forced labor camps and the horrors one has to endure in such an environment. It is sad to think that some countries still see this type of events occurring even today.</p><p>North Korea is the prime example for such deprivation of human rights. It is insane to think that just barely three years ago pizza got legalized in that country. There&rsquo;s also a harsh punishment for crimes against the government. It&rsquo;s called the generation punishment, meaning that the offenders, their parents and their children will all be imprisoned together.</p><p>Having these examples in mind, just think about how valuable freedom is. Be happy that you were born in a place where you can freely express yourself, joke about certain things and do whatever you want, for not everyone has this privilege, and it is definitely a right worth dying for. As the old saying goes &ldquo;Give me liberty or give me death!&rdquo;.</p><h2 id="heading-lau5e" title="ID: heading-lau5e" data-guid="f5a24269-4d7e-4181-800a-943fc520a56c">Essay about goals</h2><p>Essay about goals este o lucrare care abordează subiectul obiectivelor din viața noastră.

We establish goals in our life almost on a daily basis without even realizing it. Some goals might be smaller and easier to achieve, while others may take a lifetime of work. You may have heard of the yearly tradition of setting certain objectives on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Those are things that people intend to do in the year to follow in order to become a better person.</p><p>Your objectives can vary into all sorts of things, no matter how small or big your dreams are. Maybe you want to learn a different language, quit a bad habit, be more active, open your own business, write a book, etc. What can truly make a difference is how you pursue these targets. Don&rsquo;t just stand there and wait for a miracle, instead fight for what you want and don&rsquo;t give up.

The first real struggle with these languages, apart from the different accent, is the alphabet. Learning two new alphabets at the same time is quite painful and bothersome. The Japanese alphabet may be hard, but the Russian alphabet is confusing, as some of the characters look like totally different letters from our own alphabet. For example, one character looks like P, but it&rsquo;s actually R.</p><p>But if the alphabet wasn&rsquo;t too much of a struggle for you, then the grammar will surely be. Unlike the English language, their grammar can get very complicated, as certain words, pronouns and verbs can change their form depending on the context and tense of the phrase. Sure, English has similar situations, but it&rsquo;s a piece of cake compared to these two languages. Although I have yet to perfect my skills, I am trying harder and harder to get better at speaking, writing and understanding these languages. I keep telling myself to not give up.&nbsp;</p><p>But leaving aside the personal story, you can get an idea of how hard it can be to achieve a certain goal at times, even when the objectives seem rather easy. If you want motivation, your best bet is to search for success stories regarding the exact same goal that you have established in your mind. You must be prepared to face certain trials and obstacles along your way, but once you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;re going to feel as satisfied as someone can be.</p><p>Do not feel embarrassed or discouraged simply because you fail the first few times. What many people forget to mention when telling you their stories is how many times they have failed until they managed to succeed.</p><p>You will inevitably stumble upon difficulties a few times in your journey, but keep in mind your goal. That should be more than enough to motivate you if you truly want it. Whether it&rsquo;s about academic goals, personal goals, lifetime goals or other types of objectives, don&rsquo;t hesitate to try every method possible. One day you might get exactly what you are fighting for, so don&rsquo;t give up.</p><h2 id="heading-5cvqb" title="ID: heading-5cvqb" data-guid="04efcc38-3d0c-4187-a8f8-4f17eecfa47e">Essay about leadership</h2><p>Essay about leadership este o lucrare despre unul dintre cele mai importante roluri în societatea noastră, rolul de lider. Deși este o poziție dorită de mulți oameni, Essay about leadership ne arată calitățile necesare pentru obținerea acestei poziții privilegiate, precum și greutățile care vin odată cu aceasta, în contrast cu beneficiile văzute de majoritatea oamenilor.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-tte9h" title="ID: heading-tte9h">Essay</h3><p>Leadership is an important and difficult responsibility. Every great nation and organization have come to fruition because of great leaders who knew how to strategize, manage and organize every possible aspect. The world would be nothing without great leaders, but as with all things, there are also bad leaders who have made big mistakes throughout their lives, causing enormous damage and losses within a nation or organization.</p><p>What makes a great leader? Dedication to their work is a good starting point. Of course, experience and planning matter a lot, but if someone is not dedicated and fully focused on their work, then the results might not be as good as initially thought. Great leaders also take into consideration those who they command. Rather than giving orders and just expecting others to fulfill them without any help, they offer guidance and assurance in difficult situations.</p><p>As an example, teachers are leaders to their students. They educate us, give us tasks such as homework or projects and give out advice whenever necessary. A good leader doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to condemn their followers if a task is done incorrectly, instead they should guide us, make us understand the work we need to do and its importance for us. Needless to say, without a great leader, we would have no idea where to go next or what to do. A bad leader gives out orders without any explanation. They are the ones who give out challenges without offering any reward.</p><p>Furthermore, a leader should know the value of great teamwork. They know that two pairs of hands are better than one and that tasks get accomplished faster and more efficient if everyone works in tandem, instead of working alone. Sadly, not everyone is cut out to be a great leader, even if they do seek to gain such power. This is another disadvantage of gaining leadership, because power tends to corrupt people. If you have or are a great leader, you can say that you&rsquo;re lucky because you didn&rsquo;t let your power influence the way you act around others. People who do get corrupted by this tend to be dishonest and arrogant.</p><p>I think that we should all take an example from great leaders. We should appreciate them and follow their model, because that is how we will evolve and grow. Having good abilities as a leader also gives you an advantage even if you&rsquo;re not in such a position. If your boss is disorganized, for example, you can take the chance and coordinate the team yourself. Your colleagues will surely appreciate such an endeavour and you will gain the necessary experience which will later recommend you for a higher position in a company. So don&rsquo;t just sit around, go and learn, work in a team, see what qualities make a good leader for yourself and you will inevitably make your life and the lives of others better.</p><h2 id="heading-btza8" title="ID: heading-btza8" data-guid="1c291b21-e193-4557-9769-9ea22081644a">Essay about opinions</h2><p>Fie că este vorba despre politică, modă, viață mondenă sau pur și simplu un conflict de interese, cu toții avem o opinie, iar Essay about opinions este aici să te ajute s-o ai pe cea potrivită. Tinându-se departe de orice formă de influențare a opiniei, Essay about opinions este o lucrare care promovează analizarea evenimentelor și a situațiilor dintr-o perspectivă cât mai obiectivă pentru a alege cât mai bine poziția pe care o ai față de o problemă.</p><h3 id="heading-p5r2m" title="ID: heading-p5r2m">Essay</h3><p>Opinions represents the thoughts we have about a certain matter. We shape our opinions by gathering information about something in particular. Opinions can be for or against something, informed or uninformed, biased or unbiased, objective or subjective, or simply neutral. What matters most about constructing opinions is to evaluate everything you know about the subject.</p><p>You can have an opinion about anything that you can think of. First and foremost, opinions are formed slowly, as you gain more and more information about the subject at hand. Depending on your level of knowledge about a certain issue, your opinion might be either informed or uninformed. Why is it important to know as much as you can before forming an opinion? Because unlike impressions about art or similar subjects, where things can get highly subjective, we usually encounter things where there exist both correct and incorrect assumptions.</p><p>Based on what you know and the level at which the issue affects you or others directly or indirectly, you can be for, against or neutral on the matter. As an example, you can judge philosophical statements about life based on your own personal experiences, but because of the subjective nature of philosophy, your opinion isn&rsquo;t necessarily correct or incorrect, but in fields such as science, where everything is measured, observed and balanced carefully, your opinion has no effect on the result, thus it is either true or false.&nbsp;</p><p>The main thing that anyone needs to keep in mind when evaluating an exact science is to have an opinion that is as informed as possible. It is preferable to do as much research as you can before making assumptions about a subject that you don&rsquo;t know much about. Sadly, common sense isn&rsquo;t quite so common as people might believe, and proof of this can be found in social media especially, where we are constantly bombarded with fake news and pseudo-scientific websites that spill out false information constantly. The conclusion is that when speaking about an objective matter, we should always fact check everything and pay attention at the source from where we got said information.</p><p>Your opinion can also be biased on certain subjects. If it is a problem which affects you directly, the tendency to be biased rises, while the ones who are not directly affected tend to be more unbiased. True, it is hard to be neutral on certain issues, but people need to keep calm and analyse things as objectively as possible for the best results. Keep in mind that you are free to have your own opinion, but you are no free to have your own facts. Just because you want to defend a certain cause does not mean that you should fabricate fictional stories in order to keep up a certain narrative.</p><p>It is important to remember that we are all human and we can all make mistakes from time to time. Try not to judge someone too harshly for having different opinions, instead communicate with them, debate them, and take into consideration all facts before coming to a steady conclusion.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay/change" title="Essay about change" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about change</span></a><a href="/essay/family" title="Essay about family" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about family</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Fie ca este vorba de succes pe plan personal, financiar sau profesional, Essay about success acopera toate aceste subiecte, si ofera perspective noi asupra reusitelor din viata de zi cu zi. Essay about success este o lucrare de nota 10 care poate servi ca model pentru orice student dornic sa ia o nota mai mare intr-un test sau examen, precum si ca o sursa de idei pentru viitoare eseuri.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-tan2o\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tan2o\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The biggest challenge after success is shutting up about it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuccess is a rather abstract concept. Being successful can mean a lot of things. Some people might think making a lot of money means that you are a successful person. Others think the secret is having lots of friends and other connections, while some people think of success as being famous or renowned for something good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eActually, success can mean a lot of things, depending on the context. For example, having good grades in school is a good method of achieving this. You will be viewed as a model student in that situation, thus making you successful in that respective instance. Another thing that comes to mind when thinking of success, is business. Accomplished businessmen are viewed as successful because of their skills that they put into establishing deals and becoming rich.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut most people dream about success without thinking of failure. We keep hearing about the achievements of others without a mention of their failures. The truth is that most of the times, in order to prosper, one has to endure lots of hardships and never give up. The most famous example I can think of right now is Walt Disney, who got rejected by lots of animation studios over the years. His teacher even said once that he would amount to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet, Disney is now one of the most iconic brands in entertainment around the globe. Not only that, but the giant company has managed to buy out Lucas Arts, who owns the Star Wars universe and also Marvel Comics, who owns Spider-man, The Avengers, etc. As you can see, that man who \u0026ldquo;would amount to nothing\u0026rdquo; actually became out one of the biggest corporations in history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, as stated earlier, success isn\u0026rsquo;t just about obtaining money or becoming famous. I think scientists are successful people, for the simple fact that because of them our lives are now much easier. Even if most don\u0026rsquo;t win Nobel prizes or are barely ever mentioned on TV, they can still be called successful for being able to do what few people can do, and that is improving the quality of life on this planet, be it through any means necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho else might we consider successful? All the doctors and patients that are undergoing complex surgery. It is a known fact that not many people can perform life-saving operations, because they require years of training due to their sheer intricacy. To be able to save a life from a perilous affliction - that, to me, is what also means success. To be able to survive one of these operations is yet another great example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, success isn\u0026rsquo;t a specific thing. There is a whole series of factors that can make a person successful, and it all depends on the context and on your point of view. To some, even the slightest rise above their own level can mean a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-0dggz\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-0dggz\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e2bdc90c-ab8b-4454-bbf2-7216ea1dd7f2\u0022\u003eEssay about happiness\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about happiness prezintă una dintre cele mai simple și în același timp cele mai complexe probleme, fericirea. Fie că este privită din punct de vedere social, biologic sau financiar, Essay about happiness încearcă să ne dea un răspuns la întrebarea \u0026rdquo;ce este fericirea\u0026bdquo;. În această lucrare puteți găsi exemple de situații și perspective asupra fericirii, făcând Essay about happiness o lucrare în care se va putea regăsi oricare dintre noi.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-dims8\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-dims8\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn\u0027t know you left open.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing happy isn\u0026rsquo;t hard. Maintaining happiness can be difficult, though. What exactly is happiness? It\u0026rsquo;s that uplifting feeling you get when you finish all your tasks successfully. It\u0026rsquo;s the feeling you get when you know your girlfriend is anxiously waiting for you to come back home. Happiness isn\u0026rsquo;t something you can touch, it\u0026rsquo;s something that you can feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what is the secret to happiness? Well, in scientific terms, it\u0026rsquo;s dopamine and serotonin. But how do you get those dopamine and serotonin levels high enough to feel joy? That is a whole other matter, one which may differ from human to human. In fact, not just humans, but animals can also feel happiness too. Just think how excited your dog is when you arrive home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with all subjective matters, being happy is achieved differently by every other human. In fact, unlike the old saying \u0026ldquo;money can\u0026rsquo;t buy happiness\u0026rdquo;, I am fairly certain that some people actually do buy happiness with money. Not literally, of course. For instance, a starving homeless person could reek of joy when receiving money, because of the fact that they could now afford clothes or food and other basic necessities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat else could make a person happy, beside money? Well, on more common method is being loved by friends, family or even someone special. Or falling in love, for that matter. Overall, no matter how you do it, I think the ultimate goal for everybody should be happiness. In the end, what else matters? If you have everything that makes you happy and nothing can tug you off your cloud, what more do you need?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, there are cases where happiness is just for a few moments, while the rest of the time, sadness comes to fruition. Of course, I am talking about depression. People who suffer from it tend to view life in a more nihilistic way. Making these kinds of people happy is no easy task, and even if you manage it, their joy will only last a few hours at best. Depression can stem from a number of things, such as traumatic experiences like car accidents, the loss of a loved one, witnessing violence and abuse at a young age, being constantly mistreated by others and many other factors that can come into play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not easy overcoming such obstacles, as many of the people who suffer from depression have committed or at least attempted suicide. But if you do manage to pull through it and finally feel happy about yourself, you could actually call yourself successful, because it isn\u0026rsquo;t an easy battle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, happiness is the most important gift you can gift to yourself and others. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how you do it, as long as you share it, because the world needs to smile more. As John Lennon once said \u0026ldquo;When I grow up, I want to be happy\u0026bdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-z9ni7\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-z9ni7\u0022 data-guid=\u00228ef57404-920f-4736-b894-e5e97b1d8c12\u0022\u003eEssay about friendship\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about friendship este un eseu care descrie o relație pe care o cunoaștem cu toții, prietenia. Fiind ființe sociale, Essay about friendship ne arată cum se manifestă prietenia de-a lungul anilor, precum și importanța impactului pe care îl au oamenii în care alegem să avem încredere, asupra vietii si personalității noastre. Essay about friendship nu îți va spune cum și ce prieteni să-ți alegi, dar o sa-ți prezinte câteva dintre lucrurile după care ar trebui să te orientezi, atât pentru a-ți alege prietenii, cât și pentru a-ți scrie un eseu de nota 10 la următorul test sau examen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-wqxdb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-wqxdb\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFriends are the closest thing to having a family apart from your relatives. There are many valuable things in life, but choosing the right people to associate with may be one of the most important. From the moment we start walking and talking we choose our friends. Needless to say, sometimes our choices turn out to be awful, but when our choices are the right ones, the rewards can be phenomenal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI joyfully remember my childhood friends. Being young, we didn\u0026rsquo;t care about much in life, we just played all day long. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have cell phones yet at that age, so in order to meet up we actually had to walk all the day to one another\u0026rsquo;s house and knock on the door. Being kids, we also didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the teenage drama that occurs in our life now. With that said, I found myself making friends differently in the past few years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst off, buddies are no longer that simple to make. Even the ones that turn out to be trustworthy and supportive first go through multiple stages before I can truly consider them friends. The first stage is getting acquainted. Acquaintances are people that you only know on a basic level. It takes time to get to truly know someone, so I can\u0026rsquo;t really say that I would consider an acquaintance a friend due to the lack of things that we have in common. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that people my age tend to be very suspicious of others, thus it is harder to have deep conversations from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven so, acquaintances do have the potential of becoming great friends, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of time and finding the right person. My newest and most cherished friend today is Robert, my classmate with whom I sit during all of our classes. Our friendship started out as just being acquaintances, as many other classmates\u0026rsquo; friendships seem to have started out. On the first day of high school we barely spoke much apart from small talk. Things like \u0026ldquo;where are you from? what music do you like?\u0026rdquo; and all sorts of similar questions were asked by each of us. Nothing spectacular, really, but as time went on, we started to talk about deeper, meaningful things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started trusting each other and sharing all sorts of secrets. We each invited the other home to play video games or watch movies, we went to parties together where we also met other people our age with who we had fun. We started doing all sort of activities together and realized that we have a lot of fun and that we can trust each other. For me, trusting someone and having fun with them is the key to a successful friendship. Even though friendships are harder to make than when I was a kid, I think that it is only now that I have truly discovered the true meaning of having a close friend. Although Robert is not part of my family, I do feel as if he was. We may not be blood relatives, but we sure are spiritual brothers. That, to me, is true friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-s99g3\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-s99g3\u0022 data-guid=\u00220275c8a7-0de2-4a9e-9048-a0d83f859880\u0022\u003eEssay about honesty\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă te-ai întrebat vreodată ce să spui unei persoane într-o situație unde sinceritatea nu este cea mai placută opțiune, Essay about honesty este lucrarea pentru tine. Având minciuna ca și parte a vieții noastre de zi cu zi, Eseul scoate în lumina reflectoarelor onestitatea, virtute din ce în ce mai des uitată. Essay about honesty este o lucrare care provoacă moralitatea cititorului, dar si prezintă diferite perspective asupra onestitații și a rolurilor ei.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-0bxpy\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-0bxpy\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Honesty may not get you a lot of friends, but it will get you the right ones.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I think about honesty, I think about the rare virtues that can be found in humans. We all lie from time to time for a variety of different reasons. You might lie in order to protect a loved one from a painful truth, to comfort them. You might lie in order to get yourself out of trouble.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere can be many reasons, but most of the times, lies do more harm than good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA rather touching quote from one of my favorite cyberpunk video games, Deus Ex, comes to mind: \u0026ldquo;A forgotten virtue such as honesty is worth at least 20 credits\u0026rdquo;. Only one phrase, yet it\u0026rsquo;s so impactful. All of us have been affected by someone else\u0026rsquo;s lies. It might so happen that we ourselves have negatively affected someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing honest to someone is a sign of respect. The incapability of lying to someone shows that you care about them. But as stated earlier, there are exceptions to this rule. Say that, for example, one of your relatives suffers from an incurable disease. You might tell them that they\u0026rsquo;re healthy or that they have something else entirely, in the hope that their spirit won\u0026rsquo;t be broken.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonesty has an effect upon every type of relation between humans. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s about friendship, relationships, family relations or colleagues, having integrity is essential both in ethical and practical standpoints. If you\u0026rsquo;re honest, you will not have to remember any lies in order to keep other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions about you intact. Lying can lead to one or more people spotting things that don\u0026rsquo;t add up in your stories, thus revealing to them that you\u0026rsquo;re a fraud and you automatically lose their respect. Tell them the truth from the start and it makes it easier for you to build up appreciation, even if you are unqualified in certain aspects of life. Honest people deserve to get more appreciation than ever. Only then will others realize the importance of this dying virtue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonesty has also become an issue in the online environment. People can pretend or even fake lives while they\u0026rsquo;re on social media. Unpopular opinions get a lot of hate instead of actual criticisms, while following trends becomes almost obligatory for those who want popularity. This creates a rather vicious cycle of lying and pretending in order to keep likes and views up. It has become a sort of business without money, a trade for the appreciation of falsehood. Not only does this inflate people\u0026rsquo;s egos without any of the merit, but lying on the internet is much easier than it is in real life, because you can barely be held accountable for your words and deeds in this type of situation. Even worse, one can keep their anonymity when spreading disinformation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what would be the final conclusion after all these facts? Does anyone have any reason to be honest anymore? I think they do, simply for ethical reasons alone. A painful truth might not be as appreciated as a comforting lie, but in the end, the truth shall set you free!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-o2p2h\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-o2p2h\u0022 data-guid=\u0022139e6347-7411-4ea2-b1f7-3972f5afec35\u0022\u003eEssay about manners\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFie că ești la un resturant, la o întâlnire formală sau pur și simplu într-o cameră cu prietenii de familie, Essay about good manners are ceva comun tuturor acestor situații, bunele maniere. Fiind un grup de cuvinte care este cel mai des folosit în adresări care caută să facă o persoană să se simtă prost, Essay about good manners prezintă o altă perspectivă asupra problemei manierelor, arătând rolul acestora într-o societate modernă, descriindu-le ca pe o parte esențială a educației fiecărei persoane. Eseul ne arată avantajele unui comportament manierat, fiind o lucrare de nota 10 care încearcă să desprindă eticheta de snobism care vine la pachet cu pomenirea cuvântului \u0026bdquo;maniere\u0026rdquo;, fiind în același timp o sursă excelentă de inspirație pentru orice elev care încearcă să-și îmbunătățească rezultatele școlare.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-0ek1j\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-0ek1j\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eManners are a must-have in a civilised society. Wherever we go, we are subtly obliged to be mannered. Sure, there isn\u0026rsquo;t a law against having bad manners, but you will be judged negatively if you lack good manners and act inappropriate. Is this a good or a bad thing? I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing, because it shames people who don\u0026rsquo;t act accordingly, while not being too harsh on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the fact that I despise bad manners with all my heart and soul, I find it fining or imprison people based on this issue exaggerated. Violence has never solved anything. We should, instead, educate others. That\u0026rsquo;s what good manners are about, after all, right? Some people may say that good manners are a must only in formal situations, but I think that having manners in any situations is important, if not imperative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eManners are usually taught at home at a very early age, or at least they should be. I am aware and disgusted with people who don\u0026rsquo;t teach their kids how to behave in society. Any form of education should be initiated by our parents, especially manners. Although we are also taught how to behave in school, it is much easier, both for teachers and students, to improve on this process if they already know the basics from the comfort of their homes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving good manners shows that you respect other individuals and thus you also warrant respect for your own self. It is foolish to ask for respect if you don\u0026rsquo;t show it yourself. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard certain people say that manners are for snobs, but I disagree wholeheartedly with such an uninformed statement. I think that people who say such a thing get the wrong image when hearing this word. They probably imagine that \u0026ldquo;manners\u0026rdquo; is a term used by the high society, by people who go to fancy restaurants and such.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough I can sympathize with the fact that aristocrats were too arrogant and snobby, thus making this term get a bad name among others, I can\u0026rsquo;t stand people who are misinformed and still think to this day that this term only applies in such cases. \u0026ldquo;Manners\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean to be snobby and arrogant. Manners imply that you respect other individuals and that you know how to act in society. Saluting other people, for instance, is a sign of good manners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also means that you know how to act, not just on a day to day basis, but also in certain situations, such as when you are greeting and talking to someone who is older than you are, or the way that you ask the store\u0026rsquo;s salesman about a certain product, etc. Manners are a must in any healthy society. Without manners, I could only imagine people acting disrespectful and bringing shame upon themselves. To me, manners represent the highest form of respect possible and they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be viewed as conceited or vain, but rather as civil and considerate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-tbfrk\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tbfrk\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f1a28498-0613-4544-9368-6456df6f2713\u0022\u003eEssay about motivation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about motivation este unul dintre exemplele pe care le vei găsi pe Liceunet și pe care le poți accesa pentru a te inspira pentru scrierea propriului tău eseu.

Needless to say, humans need reasons to obtain certain things in order to get motivated, thus to be able to accomplish said objectives. Lack of motivation can stem from a number of different reasons. You may feel tired, unqualified, shy or simply not ready for the tasks at hand, but it is essential to overcome these obstacles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eBut how do we get past these hardships? One method which seems to do wonders with almost everybody is relaxation. Go read something, listen to music, watch a film or speak to someone do anything that calms your nerves. It is also important to receive encouragement from the right people, from the ones you admire. It is important to not underestimate yourself too much and be aware of the fact that other people were in your exact same position in the past.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eLack of motivation is even more of a problem when you are faced with tasks that you don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy. For instance, when you\u0026rsquo;re in college, you may have certain homework to do that isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly what you were expecting from your specialty, or it might be that the certain task itself is quite boring. In case this occurs, try reminding yourself why you are doing this, what is the ultimate goal you strive to achieve. You will find that motivation comes easier when asking yourself this type of questions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eOne other method is to lookup motivational messages on the web. This is a relatively new trend between adolescents and young adults, and to an extent it seems to be working. Sure, looking for these messages on pages from the internet is more impersonal than hearing it from a friend or from family, but it may just be what you need from time to time. After all, if the quote belongs to a celebrity or someone you admire, then it can make you put yourself in the same shoes as them and see that they once were also having problems.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eThis trend is especially practiced on social media platforms, where you will find tons of pages dedicated just for this exact thing.

A generous person is one that sacrifices themselves in someone else\u0026rsquo;s favour with no expectations in return. As with any golden characteristic, though it may seem to be rare, there are individuals who shine through the darkness and make the world better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA generous individual cares for the poor, the elderly and the disabled. They seek to help others whatever way they can. This trait is to be admired, although there are people who might try to profit off generosity. Sadly, these individuals exist in larger number than the generous ones and they often discourage us all from having this trait, for the simple reason that we might be taken as suckers. I think we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged by such acts, we should just be more cautious about who we help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way of making sure that your hard earned money actually helps the right people is by donating to nongovernmental organizations that actually fight for certain causes. There are numerous such organisations out there, some small, some huge, who have helped lots of people all around the planet through donations made by others. Even gaming companies have started doing such things. There is a site called Humble Bundle, where you can buy a bundle of games for any amount of money that you want and a part of the money that you give goes to a charity of your choosing. I think this is an excellent method of promoting generosity among a target audience that isn\u0026rsquo;t too well known for being generous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may also encounter donation boxes in clubs or restaurants, which are dedicated to supporting a certain cause. Generosity is exactly about these types of acts \u0026ndash; helping the ones who need it the most. The most recent example I can think of is the \u0026ldquo;Colectiv\u0026rdquo; case here, in Romania. There were many campaigns lead by all sort of organizations, clubs, venues, restaurants, hospitals, etc, that encouraged people to donate money for the victims so that they could be able to afford the medication they needed to treat their burns. Surprisingly, all the campaigns were very successful, as most of the victims have now recovered back to full health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI may have seemed pessimistic at the beginning, but thinking about the subject and just writing about it made me realize that maybe, actually, the world isn\u0026rsquo;t that dark of a place as we make it out to be some times. There is a light of hope after all. We can all change something, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of having the generosity to give something to those in need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8wtxt\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-8wtxt\u0022 data-guid=\u00227ead13cd-a33c-46ab-8721-d41dae7db130\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about kindness\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEseul este o lucrare ce descrie una dintre calitățile care suntem îndemnați s-o avem de mici, bunătatea.

Being kind unconditionally is rare, so you will know that a kind person is special. It means that they are compassionate and truly care about making the world a better place through these acts. Although beautifully complex, kindness can be appreciated by anyone. It is a universal language, one that the blind can see and the deaf can hear, as Mark Twain described it so elegantly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKindness is so important that it is even taught by most religions and philosophers in the world. No matter what your world view may be, it is hard to doubt the positive effects that acts of kindness bring. Even small acts can have an immense impact on people\u0026rsquo;s lives. Think about all the problems that you ever had in your life and how thankful you would have been if someone was kind enough to help you without asking for something in return. Needless to say that anyone would appreciate a helping hand in times of need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut kindness doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. To be kind can also encompass politeness, generosity, altruism, hospitality, patience and understanding. Don\u0026rsquo;t be kind just because you may feel obligated, instead try to understand that being this way will inevitably change others\u0026rsquo; image about you in a positive way. After all, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile, so you will also use less energy being kind and compassionate rather than arrogant and mean. Be generous to those who need it most, for even offering them a small amount of what they need can make a world of difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe patient with people, so that others may look up to your example and be patient with you as a result. Be understanding with people, because everyone is unique and different. You have no idea what immense impact understanding can have on another person\u0026rsquo;s mind. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been misunderstood, you know how hard you seek to be understood by others. Just be kind and good things will follow. By doing small acts of kindness, you will make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better and they\u0026rsquo;re going to appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust imagine how good it feels to a homeless person to receive money or food unconditionally. They might be starving, so any amount of help can truly get their hopes up. Or imagine being stuck with your homework and having a good friend who offers their help. These are just a few examples of all the varied things one can do out of kindness. So go on, go make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Go help people. You will feel a sense of accomplishment once doing so, because not everyone is kind and people really need these sorts of actions in their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ht94l\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ht94l\u0022 data-guid=\u0022818570f4-e7f8-4160-8309-2c891fd90503\u0022\u003eEssay about inspiration\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about inspiration, este o lucrare care descrie benzina creatiei, inspirația.

It is the most important factor for achieving anything important in life. Inspiration is what motivates critical thinking and creative solutions. Life without inspiration wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the same, because we would be lacking all the technology and art that have been bestowed upon us by the people who came before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is, however, a huge problem which will inevitably hit you a few times in your life \u0026ndash; lack of inspiration. What should we do in case we encounter it and what are the solutions to overcoming this dilemma? Lack of inspiration seems to set in whenever we are bored or whenever we are under huge stress. If I am not in a hurry to complete a task, I usually indulge in other activities before undertaking any assignments. If, however, I am in a hurry, I try to calm down and listen to classical music for inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, each human has their own methods for finding inspiration. Isaac Newton, as an example, found the inspiration for making the theory of gravity by observing how apples tend to fall from trees. Charles Darwin got the inspiration for writing the theory of evolution after years of researching different species from all around the world. Carl Sagan got his inspiration for writing his now-famous speech \u0026ldquo;The Pale Blue Dot\u0026rdquo; after observing how vast space is and how immense our actions seem on this little planet that is insignificant on a universal scale. Even artists get inspired either from nature, ideas, and philosophies or simply from other artists. Inspiration can be found in all sort of places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is worth mentioning that not all inspiration is good, however. I am not implying that there exists bad inspiration, just that the source from which you choose to inspire yourself can be flawed. Have you ever heard the term \u0026ldquo;pseudoscience\u0026rdquo;? If so, then you know all about those people who claim to have done scientific research without actually being scientists. But how do they come to such flawed conclusions? Because they take inspirations from several scientific theories without looking at the entire picture, without taking into consideration the variables and side effects. This is an example of flawed inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen talking about global leaders, for instance, inspiration can also be flawed. A president might make decisions that have been proven successful in the past without taking into consideration current events and economic situations. But, let\u0026rsquo;s look on the bright side, it is only in these two cases where flawed inspiration can negatively affect others. When it comes to arts or writing, only the author gets the negative attention, but the decisions made by the misinformed or uninformed can affect everyone. And as a side note, it is worth mentioning that inspiration may not be necessarily information. You might be inspired about the actions and accomplishments of others, without having gained much information from them. In any case, inspiration is something that we all need to acquire for accomplishing all sort of tasks and to have success in life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-tvtwo\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tvtwo\u0022 data-guid=\u0022cc5e6c33-6082-4a67-84b8-c371f1cf8f25\u0022\u003eEssay about fame\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about fame este un eseu care descrie una dintre aspirațiile de bază a locuitorilor secolului 21, faima.

It means that a lot of people have heard about you. I think everyone dreams about fame at one point or another in their life. To me, fame is the equivalent of success. If you are well known, if you become sort of a celebrity, then you\u0026rsquo;ve made it. But let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that fame is a two-way street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you become famous, people will judge you constantly. The way you dress, what you say, the way you act, what you do in your free time, basically your entire life will be judged by others. Your privacy will be a thing of the past. The only safe heaven when you\u0026rsquo;ve become a public person is in your own home, cut off from the rest of the world. Otherwise, on the streets, there are bound to be fans or critics who will inevitably stop to ask you questions or take pictures with you. In my opinion, although it may seem flattering at first, it can become quite annoying after a short while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even with these defects, people still strive to have those 15 minutes of fame that everyone is talking about. Numerous people are willing to do almost anything imaginable to achieve their goal. How many times have you seen a stupid video posted on YouTube or on social media? How many times have we seen people pose in all sort of embarrassing or shameful situations just to grab others\u0026rsquo; attention? Although fame has its benefits, I think people are too willing to sacrifice so many important things in order to achieve this goal. There are, however, people who get famous without dropping their pride. In fact, there are people who get more pride when becoming famous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists are one good example of becoming famous without enduring shame or doing shameful acts to achieve success. Nobel Prize winners earn their fame by helping the world to become a better place. These are the types of people that we should aspire to be. We should aspire to fame by promoting our talents and skills rather than doing dubious things in front of the world. I admire writers, artists, and people of science and culture who get famous. Those are good examples of people who actually deserve to be famous, not the pseudo-celebrities that bombard us through tabloids and second hand magazines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven so, it is important to remain humble when reaching fame. People tend to forget where they came from once they achieve success, and that, to me, is a dreadful act. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider famous people to be superior to others on a purely humane perspective. I do not approve of people who get famous doing stupid things. In an ideal world, the innovators and achievers should get famous, and we as normal individuals should still respect their privacy. Some people may consider this a utopia, but I think that with a little effort and education, we could reach this status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3gynw\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-3gynw\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d5509f26-5ea8-4960-a2dd-2f1d5dab9a8d\u0022\u003eEssay about forgiveness\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about forgiveness este un eseu despre o decizie care suntem nevoiți să o luăm în considerare de multe ori pe parcursul vieții noastre, iertarea. Fiind o decizie nobilă, dar în același timp foarte personală și complet dependentă de circumstanțe, Essay about forgiveness prezintă avantajele și importanța iertării unei persoane, prezentând un exemplu și încurajând armonia dintre oameni.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-b8oru\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-b8oru\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForgiveness means to let go of people\u0026rsquo;s past mistakes and have a fresh start with them. After all, we are human and we do tend to make mistakes quite a lot. We are far from perfect, as there are times when we make mistakes and beg for forgiveness, but other times when someone makes a mistake and we do not even try to forgive them and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are times when someone makes a mistake so huge that you may want to cast revenge upon them. In most cases, the best revenge is forgiveness, especially for small, unintentional wrongdoings. Sure, there are moments when we get hot-headed over small things, but in the end we need to overcome our anger and judge accordingly. It is not worth hating someone for unimportant stuff, because in the long run, you\u0026rsquo;re doing yourself more harm.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot forgiving someone can lead to disaster sometimes. You could ruin friendships, marriages, relationships or even careers by holding on to grief. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that a friend of yours commits the mistake of making a blunder about yourself. You realise that it was not intended, as their initial thought was only to make a joke, to make you laugh. What would be worse? To get mad a little and then calm down or to not forgive your friend, thus losing their friendship? I think the latter is far worse than the former.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have personally known this feeling. I had a formidable good friend. He had made a bad joke about me and I felt very irritated by it. I had a fight with about this, he kept asking for forgiveness, yet I let my anger take over me and call him names. Obviously, he also got mad at me and we ceased to talk or see each other immediately. We avoided one another constantly at school and none of us would even consider talking. It was only a few weeks later when we accidentally caught the bus together, so we finally decided to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe both apologized for our behaviour to one another. We both talked it over, concluding that we two made huge mistakes and regaining our friendship is far more important than that. We laughed and continued on as if nothing had ever happened. Ever since that moment, we are inseparable and no mistake takes us down. We get along so well and we\u0026rsquo;re happy that we have one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think about all of this? Was it not a better choice than to hold a grudge? I think anyone would agree that this was the right judgement. Having a friend is a marvellous gift. We should treasure our pals with every passing moment. So be good and forgive people!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-fygxx\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-fygxx\u0022 data-guid=\u0022fc2b7ae5-efeb-47fc-bb72-b525b81d6ef3\u0022\u003eEssay about freedom\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă ai avut vreodată impresia că nu ești liber să faci ce vrei, Essay about freedom poate pune putină lumină pe situație. Începând de la simplul principiu de \u0026rdquo;Libertatea mea se termină unde încep drepturile celorlalți\u0026bdquo; și până la regimul totalitar din Coreea de Nord, Essay about freedom descrie cum este vazută libertatea ca și concept în diferite zone ale lumii\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-pu6hx\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-pu6hx\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFreedom is the most sought value by any species in the entire world. Without freedom, you cannot express your individuality, you cannot discuss different opinions and ideas, you would be a mere slave doing what your master tells you to do. For me, freedom means to do whatever you want as long as it has no negative impact on others.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not my concern, nor should it be anyone else\u0026rsquo;s, what you choose to do in your own spare time, who you choose to associate with, what clothes you want to wear or how you choose to express yourself. For artists and writers, I think freedom of speech is valued as a sacred right. People should not be offended about others\u0026rsquo; opinions, instead they should discuss, debate new ideas and let everyone say what they have to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut freedom isn\u0026rsquo;t and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be limited to just free speech. One must also have freedom of religion, or freedom from religion, for that matter, freedom to defend oneself from harm done by others, freedom to live as one wishes to live and freedom of choice, just to name a few. Of course, as stated earlier, freedom ends where other people\u0026rsquo;s rights begin. It is not acceptable to deprive others of their given liberty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne simple look at totalitarian states will give you enough information in order to deduce how valuable your freedom is and how much you should cherish it, because not everyone on this planet has this right. Think about all the revolutions against totalitarian movements that occurred in the last century. People were willing to die rather than live their lives as slaves to a dictatorship. That\u0026rsquo;s how much value liberty has for the individual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust imagine a world where you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be allowed to speak against oppression or other forms of cruelty. Imagine being sent to prison for minor offenses, such as jokes. Think about how it would be to be put in forced labor camps and the horrors one has to endure in such an environment. It is sad to think that some countries still see this type of events occurring even today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNorth Korea is the prime example for such deprivation of human rights. It is insane to think that just barely three years ago pizza got legalized in that country. There\u0026rsquo;s also a harsh punishment for crimes against the government. It\u0026rsquo;s called the generation punishment, meaning that the offenders, their parents and their children will all be imprisoned together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving these examples in mind, just think about how valuable freedom is. Be happy that you were born in a place where you can freely express yourself, joke about certain things and do whatever you want, for not everyone has this privilege, and it is definitely a right worth dying for. As the old saying goes \u0026ldquo;Give me liberty or give me death!\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-lau5e\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-lau5e\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f5a24269-4d7e-4181-800a-943fc520a56c\u0022\u003eEssay about goals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about goals este o lucrare care abordează subiectul obiectivelor din viața noastră. Încercând să ducă subiectul cât mai departe de zona abstractă, Essay about goals ne dă exemple concrete, usor de înțeles care sunt la îndemâna oricui, și cu care este ușor să te regăsești.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-dhit6\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-dhit6\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoals represent our hopes and dreams. We establish goals in our life almost on a daily basis without even realizing it. Some goals might be smaller and easier to achieve, while others may take a lifetime of work. You may have heard of the yearly tradition of setting certain objectives on New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve. Those are things that people intend to do in the year to follow in order to become a better person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour objectives can vary into all sorts of things, no matter how small or big your dreams are. Maybe you want to learn a different language, quit a bad habit, be more active, open your own business, write a book, etc. What can truly make a difference is how you pursue these targets. Don\u0026rsquo;t just stand there and wait for a miracle, instead fight for what you want and don\u0026rsquo;t give up. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s easier said than done, but if you truly want something, you must earn it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s hard describing the effort you need to put into certain tasks that help you achieve your goals without giving an example from someone else\u0026rsquo;s struggles. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to learn new languages for some time now: Russian and Japanese. Of course, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy, and even now I am far from perfecting my skills. The first real struggle with these languages, apart from the different accent, is the alphabet. Learning two new alphabets at the same time is quite painful and bothersome. The Japanese alphabet may be hard, but the Russian alphabet is confusing, as some of the characters look like totally different letters from our own alphabet. For example, one character looks like P, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually R.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if the alphabet wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a struggle for you, then the grammar will surely be. Unlike the English language, their grammar can get very complicated, as certain words, pronouns and verbs can change their form depending on the context and tense of the phrase. Sure, English has similar situations, but it\u0026rsquo;s a piece of cake compared to these two languages. Although I have yet to perfect my skills, I am trying harder and harder to get better at speaking, writing and understanding these languages. I keep telling myself to not give up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut leaving aside the personal story, you can get an idea of how hard it can be to achieve a certain goal at times, even when the objectives seem rather easy. If you want motivation, your best bet is to search for success stories regarding the exact same goal that you have established in your mind. You must be prepared to face certain trials and obstacles along your way, but once you\u0026rsquo;re done, you\u0026rsquo;re going to feel as satisfied as someone can be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo not feel embarrassed or discouraged simply because you fail the first few times. What many people forget to mention when telling you their stories is how many times they have failed until they managed to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou will inevitably stumble upon difficulties a few times in your journey, but keep in mind your goal. That should be more than enough to motivate you if you truly want it. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s about academic goals, personal goals, lifetime goals or other types of objectives, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to try every method possible. One day you might get exactly what you are fighting for, so don\u0026rsquo;t give up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5cvqb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-5cvqb\u0022 data-guid=\u002204efcc38-3d0c-4187-a8f8-4f17eecfa47e\u0022\u003eEssay about leadership\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about leadership este o lucrare despre unul dintre cele mai importante roluri în societatea noastră, rolul de lider. Deși este o poziție dorită de mulți oameni, Essay about leadership ne arată calitățile necesare pentru obținerea acestei poziții privilegiate, precum și greutățile care vin odată cu aceasta, în contrast cu beneficiile văzute de majoritatea oamenilor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-tte9h\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tte9h\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeadership is an important and difficult responsibility. Every great nation and organization have come to fruition because of great leaders who knew how to strategize, manage and organize every possible aspect. The world would be nothing without great leaders, but as with all things, there are also bad leaders who have made big mistakes throughout their lives, causing enormous damage and losses within a nation or organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat makes a great leader? Dedication to their work is a good starting point. Of course, experience and planning matter a lot, but if someone is not dedicated and fully focused on their work, then the results might not be as good as initially thought. Great leaders also take into consideration those who they command. Rather than giving orders and just expecting others to fulfill them without any help, they offer guidance and assurance in difficult situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an example, teachers are leaders to their students. They educate us, give us tasks such as homework or projects and give out advice whenever necessary. A good leader doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to condemn their followers if a task is done incorrectly, instead they should guide us, make us understand the work we need to do and its importance for us. Needless to say, without a great leader, we would have no idea where to go next or what to do. A bad leader gives out orders without any explanation. They are the ones who give out challenges without offering any reward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, a leader should know the value of great teamwork. They know that two pairs of hands are better than one and that tasks get accomplished faster and more efficient if everyone works in tandem, instead of working alone. Sadly, not everyone is cut out to be a great leader, even if they do seek to gain such power. This is another disadvantage of gaining leadership, because power tends to corrupt people. If you have or are a great leader, you can say that you\u0026rsquo;re lucky because you didn\u0026rsquo;t let your power influence the way you act around others. People who do get corrupted by this tend to be dishonest and arrogant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that we should all take an example from great leaders. We should appreciate them and follow their model, because that is how we will evolve and grow. Having good abilities as a leader also gives you an advantage even if you\u0026rsquo;re not in such a position. If your boss is disorganized, for example, you can take the chance and coordinate the team yourself. Your colleagues will surely appreciate such an endeavour and you will gain the necessary experience which will later recommend you for a higher position in a company. So don\u0026rsquo;t just sit around, go and learn, work in a team, see what qualities make a good leader for yourself and you will inevitably make your life and the lives of others better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-btza8\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-btza8\u0022 data-guid=\u00221c291b21-e193-4557-9769-9ea22081644a\u0022\u003eEssay about opinions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFie că este vorba despre politică, modă, viață mondenă sau pur și simplu un conflict de interese, cu toții avem o opinie, iar Essay about opinions este aici să te ajute s-o ai pe cea potrivită. Tinându-se departe de orice formă de influențare a opiniei, Essay about opinions este o lucrare care promovează analizarea evenimentelor și a situațiilor dintr-o perspectivă cât mai obiectivă pentru a alege cât mai bine poziția pe care o ai față de o problemă.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-p5r2m\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-p5r2m\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOpinions represents the thoughts we have about a certain matter. We shape our opinions by gathering information about something in particular. Opinions can be for or against something, informed or uninformed, biased or unbiased, objective or subjective, or simply neutral. What matters most about constructing opinions is to evaluate everything you know about the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can have an opinion about anything that you can think of. First and foremost, opinions are formed slowly, as you gain more and more information about the subject at hand. Depending on your level of knowledge about a certain issue, your opinion might be either informed or uninformed. Why is it important to know as much as you can before forming an opinion? Because unlike impressions about art or similar subjects, where things can get highly subjective, we usually encounter things where there exist both correct and incorrect assumptions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on what you know and the level at which the issue affects you or others directly or indirectly, you can be for, against or neutral on the matter. As an example, you can judge philosophical statements about life based on your own personal experiences, but because of the subjective nature of philosophy, your opinion isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily correct or incorrect, but in fields such as science, where everything is measured, observed and balanced carefully, your opinion has no effect on the result, thus it is either true or false.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main thing that anyone needs to keep in mind when evaluating an exact science is to have an opinion that is as informed as possible. It is preferable to do as much research as you can before making assumptions about a subject that you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about. Sadly, common sense isn\u0026rsquo;t quite so common as people might believe, and proof of this can be found in social media especially, where we are constantly bombarded with fake news and pseudo-scientific websites that spill out false information constantly. The conclusion is that when speaking about an objective matter, we should always fact check everything and pay attention at the source from where we got said information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour opinion can also be biased on certain subjects. If it is a problem which affects you directly, the tendency to be biased rises, while the ones who are not directly affected tend to be more unbiased. True, it is hard to be neutral on certain issues, but people need to keep calm and analyse things as objectively as possible for the best results. Keep in mind that you are free to have your own opinion, but you are no free to have your own facts. Just because you want to defend a certain cause does not mean that you should fabricate fictional stories in order to keep up a certain narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is important to remember that we are all human and we can all make mistakes from time to time. Try not to judge someone too harshly for having different opinions, instead communicate with them, debate them, and take into consideration all facts before coming to a steady conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about values and goals (success, happiness, honesty, manners)","MetaDescription":"Essay about success este o lucrare in care se prezinta diferite aspecte ale succesului in viata.
