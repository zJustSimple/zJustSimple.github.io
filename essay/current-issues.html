Global warming is a problem caused by too much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which basically acts as a blanket, trapping heat and thus warming the planet. This makes the Earth&rsquo;s surface become gradually hotter with each passing year, as we have seen a rise in average global temperatures in the last decade.</p><p>Should we be really concerned with such an issue, considering the fact that it&rsquo;s not the first time the climate has changed on this planet&rsquo;s lifetime? Well, yes. Because this sort of change ultimately affects every creature&rsquo;s way of living on the planet. This time it&rsquo;s particularly different, because the climate is being changed directly by human input. One of the biggest problems global warming brings us is the rising of the sea level. This could result in the flooding of low lying coastal areas and cities, such as Egypt, the Netherlands, and Bangladesh.</p><p>The heat wave and subsequent melting of the ice caps might not be the only problem. Another dilemma cause by global warming is represented by changes in weather patterns. Many areas around the globe, especially island-type locations might soon be experiencing hurricanes and floods more often due to the rising sea levels. Climate change will also have a huge impact on animals, as fish population might decline and insects might grow in numbers. Needless to say, polar bears, penguins, seals and other animals that live in cold areas will be extremely affected by these changes. Overall, predictions don&rsquo;t look good.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what can we do to stop this? There are several ways to solve this issue, though none of them are absolutely perfect. Planting more trees is the obvious choice, because trees absorb CO2 and give out oxygen, which is beneficial for humans and other animals. Secondly, switching from a fuel-powered car to an electric one would be recommended, but the prices for electric vehicles is too steep for the majority of people&rsquo;s pockets. Switching from coal operated power plants to nuclear, wind turbines or solar panels is one more solution to add to the list, but those aren&rsquo;t perfect either.&nbsp;</p><p>Wind turbines have a bad habit of overloading when there&rsquo;s too much wind, thus causing possible short circuits. Solar panels work best when there&rsquo;s lots of sunlight, so they&rsquo;re not going to be efficient during the winter. Nuclear power plants represent a high risk if not operated correctly, as seen in the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents in 1986 and 2011, respectively. Is there a perfect solution to this problem? Sadly, no. We might have to wait a few more years before someone discovers new ways of improving the situation, but until then, it is worth trying to protect the planet as much as possible.</p><h2 id="heading-pfkdg" title="ID: heading-pfkdg" data-guid="c53b17a2-9ad7-43c3-8bca-8ba2981096ad"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about deforestation</span></h2><p>Essay about deforestation este o lucrare care atrage atenția asupra tăierii copacilor, o problemă care devine din ce în ce mai gravă în ultimii ani.

Essay about deforestation este o lucrare care caută să atragă atenția asupra unei probleme ecologice destul de importante</p><h3 id="heading-cond6" title="ID: heading-cond6">Essay</h3><p>Imagine Earth without forests and think about what effects that may have on the planet. Deforestation is, at a basic level, just that: the disappearance of forests, or parts of forests from the planet that we call home. How and why does it occur? Mainly, deforestation occurs because of humans. We take for granted the natural resources we have, often forgetting to replenish them. In more common terms, we cut down trees without planting others in their place.</p><p>I think most people already know the answer to why we cut down trees. The more complicated question is &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we plant others in their place?&rdquo; However you look at the situation, cutting down trees is a somewhat necessary evil. We cut down trees in order to produce paper, which we use for all sorts of different tasks. We cut them down because in certain places, people still need to use wood for making a fire and keeping a decent temperature during winter, because not all places have access to gas or electric heating. We cut down trees in order to build houses and shelters and all sorts of other buildings.</p><p>Basically, cutting down trees is necessary in order to maintain a modern standard of living. But what are the effects caused by deforestation? For a start, trees output the oxygen that we so desperately need in order to survive. They do this by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, thus lessening the impact that greenhouse gasses have on the planet and putting a minor stop on global warming. Secondly, erosion is likely to occur in places where deforestation takes place at an alarming rate. NASA&rsquo;s Earth Observatory even went as far as claiming that if deforestation maintains its current rate, we might see the disappearance of rainforests within 100 years.&nbsp;</p><p>How is our country handling this problem? Not too good. Many of our mountain regions seem to have lost a lot of trees. The earth in those areas keeps eroding faster and faster, causing landslides and thus affecting the entire area around those parts. We have to deal not only with companies who exploit these resources, but with people who also cut down trees in the forest for their own gain. As stated earlier, this wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge problem if people planted trees after they cut some down, but they don&rsquo;t do this. Either they don&rsquo;t care or they don&rsquo;t realise what a threat this represents for all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>What can we do in order to stop this? The simplest solution, and I can&rsquo;t stress this enough, is to plant more trees. Although preferably, we should stop cutting down trees, that option isn&rsquo;t too feasible in the real world due to the necessity of wood. Gather a group of friends and go out there and plant as many trees as possible, for you will be doing yourself and the whole world a huge favour.</p><h2 id="heading-oxme1" title="ID: heading-oxme1" data-guid="f2159614-fe28-49e6-ba56-99bea1c6868c"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about pollution</span></h2><p><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Dacă ai aruncat vreodată ambalaje pe jos, Essay about pollution are să-ți transmită câteva idei.

Pollution is the number one cause of global warming and overall climate change. There are ways to stop pollution, though none of them are one hundred percent perfect. However, we should do our best to ensure that we pollute as less as humanly possible. But to do so, we must first know what exactly causes pollution.</p><p>First and foremost, the biggest amount of pollution comes from the industrial complex and cars. Coal power stations and fuel operated vehicles release carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, producing a greenhouse effect and thus causing global warming. Not only that, but the gasses emitted by such sources also make the air uneasy and unpleasant to breathe for both humans and animals. I used to live near a coal operated power station and I can tell you first-hand that it is truly horrifying when you go back to such a place after visiting an area with almost zero air pollution, such as a forest or a village.</p><p>Secondly, we pollute the environment by throwing trash such as plastic into oceans and in the environment in general. This is extremely dangerous for the wildlife, as fish, for example, could get caught in plastic bags and be trapped there for the rest of their life, as plastic only degrades in a huge amount of time. There have also been cases of oil spills inside oceans, which have negatively affected these animals, causing parts of the water to be uninhabitable and undrinkable. This is a direct effect of people&rsquo;s negligence and lack of care for the environment, unlike the former case, where we need coal powered stations to have electricity or cars to transport people and goods.</p><p>There are also other smaller forms of pollution that can be easily overcome, such as noise pollution and light pollution, which both implicate a higher than necessary level of sound and artificial light, respectively. However, the first two forms of pollution are very serious and directly affect the environment. You may ask yourself in what way can we end this. The obvious solution would be to replace coal power stations with wind turbines, solar panels or nuclear power plants. Classic cars could also be replaced by electric vehicles. All of these have the advantage of significantly reducing pollution, but they are not perfect, because they are not cost-efficient and can fail easily in certain situations.</p><p>The solution to avoiding plastic pollution would be to recycle and make as many packages biodegradable. But making every type of package biodegradable is not perfect either, because most products need a long shelf life, and having the surprise of the package of milk, for instance, degrading overnight would be yet another problem. So, the only real and efficient problem solver would be recycling. People should be encouraged to recycle as much as they can instead of throwing absolutely everything in the trash bin. Fortunately, there are many organizations that offer users the possibility to recycle a vast amount of materials.</p><p>We might not be perfect at combating pollution, but we are getting there. People need to realize how important the protection of the environment is and do their part in keeping it clean. Researchers all around the globe are working hard to find more and more possible solutions for this problem. It is only a matter of time until we can finally reach the point where we can proudly say that the planet is pollution-free.

Obviously, these issues are important and something needs to be done in order to suppress them, Luckily, there are quite a few organizations out there that are striving to resolve them as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p><p>The most common issue that people are talking about is the pollution caused by cars. Indeed, carbon dioxide emissions affect the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, thus enhancing the global warming effect, but some solutions are not as good as others. For example, The European Union proposed a carbon tax for car drivers, yet that has neither stopped people from buying cars, nor has it slowed down the gas&rsquo; effects.&nbsp;</p><p>Private companies, such as Tesla Motors, on the other hand, have come with a much more reasonable solution: produce electric cars. These vehicles operate exclusively on electricity and can easily replace a normal vehicle, but their downside is that they are quite expensive, at least for the moment.</p><p>Another way to pollute the air is by having coal operated power stations. People who live in industrial parts of a city know this very well, as they often complain about the smell. The solutions proposed by the majority of environmental agencies are solar panels and wind turbines, but those are not yet perfect either. Yes, they generate current without polluting the environment, but solar panels tend to fail during winter times, when the Sun&rsquo;s rays are at minimum. On the other hand, wind turbines tend to overload when the wind is too strong, thus causing a high risk to short circuit people&rsquo;s devices.</p><p>Nuclear power plants are mostly risk-free if operated correctly, but people tend to stigmatize those because of the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents. This raises yet another, more frightening issue, one which could have brought the end of the world back during the days of The Cold War. Atomic energy could prove very useful if handled correctly, for the good reasons, but in the wrong hands it can do way more harm than good, as proven in the last century. Out of all these potential solutions against pollution, none are perfect.</p><p>It is clear that we need to further research potential ways to prevent pollution. Like all scientific wonders, this may be a task that could take a few more years to perfect, but as we have seen in the past, with gadgets and technology in general, what may seem science fiction today, might be the reality of tomorrow, so we should never abandon the hope of a cleaner planet.</p><p>In conclusion, we should always try to protect the environment, as this planet is our home. Although none of the solutions are perfect, we should all strive to achieve the ultimate goal of keeping the Earth clean and accessible to all beings, not just humans.</p><h2 id="heading-ur34y" title="ID: heading-8jia7" data-guid="5f59dab5-bb6f-4cb1-b65a-fb3ef809457d"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about unemployment</span></h2><p><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about unemployment este o lucrare care vizează un subiect intâlnit aproape în fiecare țară, șomajul. Deși pare o problemă permanentă, care nu prezintă posibilitatea unei soluții, Essay about unemployment încearcă să pătrundă umpic în universul socio-economic, analizând câteva dintre cauzele șomajului, și prezentând niște măsuri demne de luat în considerare.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id="heading-7lkjj" title="ID: heading-7lkjj"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay</span></h3><p>Unemployment is a major issue in many countries around the globe. The causes can be numerous and vary from region to region. Of course, like with any problem, there are several possible solutions meant to resolve this issue. The first major problem that obstructs people from getting a job is the lack of skills that are valuable on the labour market.</p><p>People often seek jobs as soon as they leave high school, without taking into consideration the fact that high school barely qualifies people for low paying jobs at best. Even some faculties are guilty of this, as the skills that they teach people, although valuable from some perspectives, are worthless when it comes to getting a job. This brings us to yet another issue which is similar to the first.</p><p>There are too many people that go to universities, seeking jobs in domains that are too heavily crowded. Statistics show that in our country, the journalism industry is full, yet students go to journalism faculties, thus creating even more jobless graduates, while faculties such as chemistry, engineering and other similar domains are almost empty, even though the labour market in those sectors needs more skilled people to employ. Of course, this is due to the fact that those faculties are hard and necessitate a lot of work.</p><p>Another issue might be that the market is too heavily influenced by government regulation. A friend of mine tried to open a restaurant last year and I have seen first-hand how hard it is to do such a thing. The laws are numerous and exhausting. The taxes and tariffs are overwhelming, especially for the small businesses who are barely getting off their feet. If we want to create more jobs for people who seek them, then we need to deregulate the laws that make it hard for people to open and run their own business.</p><p>Another problem that comes from the government is the imposing of a certain minimum wage and economic inflation. Most major currencies around the globe have slowly lost their initial value due to these problems. Although this statement might upset some people, artificially increasing people&rsquo;s salaries automatically makes prices go up in order to maintain competitiveness, thus creating inflation and the overall value loss that most currencies have suffered throughout the last decades.</p><p>If these issues don&rsquo;t get fixed, then unemployment will continue to haunt us forever. The fact that social security and welfare have gotten so high is yet another reason why many choose to stay on government benefits instead of seeking work. Personally, I think that government should stop intervening so much in the market and just let it be free and do its own thing. When we look at countries where the market doesn&rsquo;t have government imposed impediments, such as Switzerland, we see that the salaries get high without having steep prices. Free the markets and you will free the world.</p><h2 id="heading-fyk36" title="ID: heading-fyk36" data-guid="1ba88221-1961-4a16-89c8-6ca249006183">Essay about junk food</h2><p>Essay about junk food este o lucrare care ne îndeamnă să aruncăm o privire mai atentă la subiectul fast-food-ului sau &rdquo;mâncării la minut&rdquo;. Fiind un subiect destul de discutat atât prin viu grai cât și în mass media, Essay about junk food încearcă să pună într-o altă perspectivă &bdquo;moartea lentă a fast-food-ului&rdquo;, mutând vina de la mancare, la consumatori.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-anoov" title="ID: heading-anoov">Essay</h3><p>It is widely known that humans and other animals need food and nutrients in order to survive. However, not every type of food is healthy, especially in large doses. Even healthy foods can have certain side effects if consumed in huge quantities. Just imagine how bad junk food is in that regard.</p><p>Eating food is the equivalent of refuelling your car&rsquo;s gas tank. We need it in order to operate at our best during the day, but just like how you have to be careful what type of fuel you put in your car, you also have to be careful what type of food you put in your body. Keep in mind that eating junk food from time to time isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad if you calculate your calories, fats and sugars correctly, but eating it on a daily or almost daily basis can have several negative effects.</p><p>For instance, because of all the fats inside cooking oil and fries, your arteries could get clogged up, thus forcing your heart to work harder in order to make blood circulate through your veins normally. This is an especially risky issue because it increases the risk of heart disease, failure or cardiac arrest. Sure, you can eliminate fats and calories through vigorous exercise, however, the more you have, the more you need to work harder in order to cleanse your body from it all.</p><p>Eating lots of sweets will inevitably increase the sugar levels in your blood, thus adding a huge risk for developing diabetes. This is a serious disease than can affect a person&rsquo;s everyday life and requires special injectable treatment known as insulin in order to keep all the body&rsquo;s functions at a normal, sustainable level. Needless to say, treatment can get expensive, as you may need several doses on a daily basis, depending on how aggravate your situation has become.</p><p>Lastly, your body can get fat quite quickly. This in itself is a major issue, but it does also bring its fair share of other problems. You tend to sweat a lot when there&rsquo;s too much heat, you become less athletic and more prone to tiring quickly, your heart needs to pump a lot more blood in order to maintain your organs, thus being more prone to causing immense blood pressure and other similar problems. Do not allow yourself to go to this level.</p><p>Eat healthy, try to abstain yourself from temptations and only eat at fast food restaurants as a last option. There&rsquo;s no serious risk present in eating such snacks from time to time, but do try to keep things very clean in general. Try eating salads, vegetables, fruits and drinking only natural juices on a daily basis. Don&rsquo;t forget your meat intake, because meat does have its benefits, such as protein, which carves muscles.</p><p>In conclusion, a balanced diet, rigorous exercise and a patience of steel are required to have a healthy, normal life, with all the benefits that other fit humans also have, such as athletic abilities, speed and agility and lots of energy.</p><h2 id="heading-b99fs" title="ID: heading-b99fs" data-guid="99f3c4b4-2f9e-4df8-92bb-e68c4565cd1e">Essay about globalisation</h2><p>Primești pe un calculator fabricat în China, asamblat în Germania și testat în România un mail din America pentru a confirma comanda pentru tricoul ce l-ai comandat din Taiwan.

Fiind un fenomen care astăzi ni se pare la fel de normal ca și soarele care răsare zilnic, Essay about globalization ne prezintă atât aspecte pozitive cât și aspecte negative ale globalizării și cum afectează aceasta lumea în secolul 21.</p><h3 id="heading-wwcnk" title="ID: heading-wwcnk">Essay</h3><p>Globalization&rsquo;s aim is to facilitate trade and migration throughout different countries. It aims to do so by establishing certain international laws and deals which would then enact these goals. However, not all aspects of globalization are necessarily good. Some of them may seem good on paper, but can turn out as disastrous in practice.</p><p>There are several branches to this phenomenon: cultural globalization, economic globalization, political globalization, military globalization and environmental globalization. The first three get the most attention from academicians. How do these practices affect people overall? Let&rsquo;s explore the both the good and the bad from each.</p><p>Economic globalization is the dream of any entrepreneur. It alleviates most of the taxes and impediments required in order to sell or buy items from other countries, thus allowing a freer trade than before. If you&rsquo;ve ever bought something online from a different country, chances are you already know how much of a pain shipping costs can be, unless you got a free shipping offer from a major website that can afford to cover up those costs for you. The downside to this approach is that smaller businesses might not thrive as well depending on the current established laws set by international treaties.</p><p>Cultural globalization means exchanging ideas about different cultures with people from all over the world. This also includes migrations, which in itself can be both good and bad. A good example of migration would be when people go to work in other countries, to fill in the manpower needed in order to sustain the ever growing labor market. However, some migrate in order to get welfare. This helps them on a personal level, but on the big economic scale it affects the rest of us, because in certain countries people who live on welfare might actually have more money than someone who works a low-end job.</p><p>The political, military and environmental forms of globalization are heavily intertwined. The ultimate goal is to assure peace between all countries, offer support for those who are at war and protect the environment. Nevertheless, politicians are also human and they tend to make quite a lot of mistakes when it comes to these issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a certain political power such as the EU involved in every member country&rsquo;s policy will inevitably have an impact on their sovereignty. While local politicians can be voted for and held accountable, the people in Brussels have almost nothing to fear, which begs the question if they should even have such control over others.</p><p>Furthermore, when it comes to environmental issues, the solutions which were proposed aren&rsquo;t that great. Taxing people based on their car&rsquo;s carbon emissions hasn&rsquo;t stopped them from buying them and environmental friendly power sources are not too sustainable. What we need is to discuss these problems and come up with better solutions.</p><p>At the end of the day, globalization is both good and bad. The key to it being successful is to actually implement the things that work great about it and fix the things that do not work so great. Whatever your stance might be on this subject, it is important to share your ideas in order to come up with better results.</p><h2 id="heading-4mg1m" title="ID: heading-4mg1m" data-guid="4cff7c66-364e-4166-bf02-566d58cb45e6">Essay about water</h2><p>Essay about water este o lucrare despre unul dintre elementele indispensabile vieții, apa.

Essay about water este o lucrare de nota 10, care atrage atenția asupra problemelor de atitudine asupra resurselor naturale, fiind în același timp o sursă de inspirație excelentă pentru orice elev care caută să ia o notă mare la urmatoarea examinare.</p><h3 id="heading-pwirs" title="ID: heading-pwirs">Essay</h3><p>Water is essential to the survival of humans, animals and plants. Our bodies are made up mostly of water, which further shows how important it is. Life on earth would practically be impossible without water&rsquo;s existence. With this said, I find it mind-blowing that people tend to waste water or pollute it, especially that in other parts of the world, people aren&rsquo;t as lucky as we are. Yes, surprisingly there are places where water is scarce, and this is a huge problem for the population in such areas.</p><p>Water scarcity is a huge problem in places such as Africa or desert areas. Due to extreme temperature and lack of rain, people often have to walk long distances to find an oasis or a lake, which makes living in such areas very hard. Without water, our body dehydrates and slowly but surely starts dying. It&rsquo;s sad to think about this kind of stuff, considering that we live in a country that has no such problem. We should be thankful that we live in a place where water can be found so easily.</p><p>It is somewhat paradoxical to think that an element which gives life can also kill. There are, unfortunately, many cases where people drown in water. I think it&rsquo;s absurd that that although we live on a planet which is covered mostly by water, we as humans don&rsquo;t know how to swim by default. It is a skill that we have to earn through exercise. Imagine how much of the bottom of the oceans we have not explored due to our inability to breathe underwater. Granted, the pressure would kill us instantaneously if we were to dive that deep, but one can only wonder what life forms lie in the abyss.</p><p>But, alas, we are simply made to live on land and just drink water, not live in it. So, what can we do in order to preserve this precious element? First and foremost, we need to stop wasting it so much. We shouldn&rsquo;t leave the tap or the shower on when we&rsquo;re not using them. Although plentiful in our country, it is not wise to waste something so important. Imagine if water was a fairly scarce resource, like oil, for example. Not only would cost a lot more to transport and distribute water, but it&rsquo;s price would also increase drastically. We are very lucky that we don&rsquo;t have such a problem, but I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s a good idea to take it for granted.</p><p>What boggles my mind even more is the way we pollute water without even thinking about it. Why do people who go to the beach throw their trash so easily in the sea? Doing this is harmful to the ecosystem, especially to the animals who live inside that body of water. You wouldn&rsquo;t like it if someone came over and threw their junk into your home, so you should be more considerate about other animals&rsquo; home. Water is evidently a huge part of nature, and we as humans should respect and protect nature and all of its glorious creations as much as possible. Be responsible with water, for it represents life itself.</p><h2 id="heading-1dafr" title="ID: heading-1dafr" data-guid="7ddf8b53-7a51-4421-87d6-4a35f8fe141b">Essay about obesity</h2><p>Începem să auzim din ce în ce mai des despre moartea lentă a fast-food-ului, iar Essay about obesity este aici ca să pună lucrurile în perspectivă.

Fast food and pizza restaurants are ever so popular these days and are considered the main cause of obesity apart from sedentariness. Fortunately, there are several ways a person can lose weight, though none of them are easy, and don&rsquo;t be tricked by people who offer diet pills, because those have been proven to be fake and a total waste of money.</p><p>First and foremost, obesity has negative effects upon someone&rsquo;s health. Fat and cholesterol can clog up veins and arteries, thus preventing good blood circulation and putting more pressure on the heart. Secondly, being obese makes you sweat a lot and impedes your resistance to heat, thus making it harder for you to breath or go out during hot periods. Not to mention that it doesn&rsquo;t look aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>This is even more affecting towards children, as it inhibits them from growing up healthy. But on the bright side, it is far easier to lose weight when one is young. Losing weight is no easy task, as you will need to go on a strict diet and have a stable fitness program. But if you manage to go through with these tasks, you won&rsquo;t regret it. Having a healthy and beautiful body is something that everyone dreams about.</p><p>Not only will you be less tired when doing physical activities, but you will also feel better about yourself. People will admire you for being able to put up so much effort into your looks, as everyone knows it&rsquo;s not easy to maintain a good looking silhouette. You don&rsquo;t have to take these advices and comparisons as offensive. No doctor or nutritionist is trying to offend you, they are trying to help you get into shape and be healthy.</p><p>Of course, just like with obesity, it is not healthy to be too thin either. It is necessary to keep a balance with your physique, just like anything other in life. Both excess and insufficiency are bad for us. But apart from third world countries, anorexia isn&rsquo;t as spread as obesity is in developed countries. So, what can be done to combat this huge problem? I think it all comes to down to each individual&rsquo;s will. No one should have the authority to restrict or impose laws on what and how much people can eat, but awareness for the issue can and should be raised. The more informed people are about issues such as these, the less likely they are to indulge in excessive consumption of unhealthy foods.</p><p>In the end, hope is not lost for obese people, because solutions exist, though they are fairly difficult to enact. All you need is ambition and hard work in order to get that beach body that you so desire to have.</p><p>So hit the gym, pack up on salads and vegetables, try walking to work instead of taking the bus and in a few months you&rsquo;re going to feel as if you were reborn!</p><h2 id="heading-omj1c" title="ID: heading-omj1c" data-guid="640911b9-b87a-4c47-96f0-47bb2a46647c">Essay about addiction</h2><p>Essay about addiction aduce în discuție un subiect foarte controversat, dar din păcate foarte des întâlnit, dependența.

You probably already met quite a few people who are addicted to tobacco, or cigarettes to put it in more common terms. You most likely have colleagues who have a hard time getting up in the morning without a cup of coffee. And you&rsquo;ve definitely seen alcoholics in bars.</p><p>What do you think forms addiction? Is it the fact that a certain person feels incomplete without indulging in certain substances? Is it the fact that they feel like outcasts and deal with their problems by abusing something? Or is it the simple fact that once contacting different chemicals, a sort of bond is formed which is hard to let go of? You&rsquo;re inevitably going to encounter all of these possibilities when exploring addiction.</p><p>Think about smokers and how they got this bad habit. Most simply started out of curiosity and end up smoking an entire pack a day, but there are some exceptions who only smoke occasionally or just smoke a few cigarettes and quit as if it was nothing. So if you don&rsquo;t get addicted from the first dose of smoking, why do some people continue to do it long after that? Because smoking relieves stress and is a way of passing time. I&rsquo;ve seen students quit smoking for a few months and then get right back into the game when the exam session is in full swing.</p><p>Yes, stress is a major factor when someone just can&rsquo;t get enough from the first cigarette they ever put in their mouths. Otherwise, they would feel no need of doing it. The sad part is that even after the stress period has passed, if you&rsquo;ve smoked a pack during that time, you will inevitably get hooked by the nicotine found within the tobacco. Quitting this habit is no easy task, as you constantly feel the need to pump some nicotine in your blood system, but there are methods that can work.&nbsp;</p><p>Try going out with friends who don&rsquo;t smoke, preferably in non-smoking areas in order to get yourself mentally prepared for quitting. In case you find that method too hard, buy yourself an electronic cigarette or nicotine patches, so that you can still get the feeling of smoking without the hazardous effects. Or you could simply do something else entirely whenever you feel the need. Either way, quit your addiction before it&rsquo;s not too late.</p><p>Of course, smoking isn&rsquo;t the only addiction around here. There&rsquo;s technology and internet addiction, drug addiction, alcohol addiction, social media addiction, video games addiction, gambling addiction and so on. The important part is to let go of any addiction that otherwise hinders your normal functions as a human being a start becoming better. Surround yourself with great people and good will.</p><h2 id="heading-bnqcq" title="ID: heading-bnqcq" data-guid="64ed42a5-41e5-4d84-9402-c775f4c55335">Essay about democracy</h2><p>Dacă ai luxul să te plângi de candidații care participă la alegeri, de drumul pâna la urnele de vot sau de zecile de fluturașe din cutia poștală cu pozele candidaților, atunci Essay about democracy îți explică de ce ar trebui să te bucuri de aceste lucruri.

De asemenea, eseul nu uită să pomenească și defectele, precizând că deși este cel mai bun sistem de guvernare pe care îl avem, este departe de a fi perfect.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-kvqn3" title="ID: heading-kvqn3">Essay</h3><p>Democracy might not be a perfect system, but it is the best system that we have ever had. Living in Romania, my parents always told me about the horrors of the communist regime that took place in our beloved country. They strive to provide everything they can for me and they want to send me to a good university, so that I may get the chance that they never had under the totalitarian regime.</p><p>Unlike in other regimes, in democracy the power is divided into several parts of the government. It is not held by only one person who automatically has control over every aspect of the country&rsquo;s politics and economics. The main human right and advantage that democracy offers is the ability to vote for who will govern the country, region or city and village for the following years. Elections in democratic societies are usually held every 4 or 5 years for mayors, presidents and the parliament.</p><p>But what do we do if none of the candidates are worthy for us? Should we not vote then? Actually, we should. If we don&rsquo;t like any candidate, then we can always cancel our vote by putting the stamp on a plural number of candidates instead of one, or simply by submitting our paper ballot without the stamp. But why should we even bother to do this if we don&rsquo;t want any candidate? We have to do it in order to avoid voter fraud. Yes, democracy isn&rsquo;t perfect. There have been numerous cases where people who counted the votes have used their power to submit several more votes for a candidate on names that didn&rsquo;t go to vote for the elections.</p><p>There are also people who argue that they don&rsquo;t support democracy for the simple reason that they are silenced because they are not part of a majority. Well, when it comes to voting, that is true, but in democracy minorities are viewed as important, unlike in other regimes, so those opinions are merely half informed. What is a problem is that politicians tend to do the opposite of what they promise during their campaigns. Although we vote for politicians, we do not have the power to vote over most laws that get passed in congress.</p><p>How can we overcome this disadvantage? Well, you could always start a petition either against or for the introduction of a certain law. Although no one has absolute power in the state in a democracy, governments usually listen when a lot of people go to voice their opinion on a certain issue. Protesting has also showed major success in the past few years in our country. Even if we are insignificant in the overall political scheme, we can make our voices heard in a democracy, unlike in other regimes.</p><p>For me, this system is not perfect by far, but it is absolutely the best we have for now.

Essay about gender discrimination este o lucrare care atrage atenția asupra unor atitudini greșite prezente în țara noastră precum și asupra atitudinilor din aceeași categorie prezente în alte țări.</p><h3 id="heading-to9vm" title="ID: heading-to9vm">Essay</h3><p>Gender discrimination is a big problem, even in civilised societies. Both men and women are discriminated against in certain aspects of life. Too many times we hear people say such phrases as &ldquo;You hit like a girl&rdquo; or &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s job&rdquo;. This issue is even greater in third world countries, where women are forced to dress a certain way or marry a certain individual chosen by their parents.</p><p>Such discrimination can occur in the court, at the workplace, in school, at the clubs and in many other places. Even if these are still relevant issues, there are certain groups that are very vocal and exaggerate to an extreme, such as third wave feminists and men&rsquo;s rights activists. These groups have a tendency to victimize themselves to an almost petty level, which makes most people think that the issues that they talk about are non-existent or don&rsquo;t matter, because of the groups&rsquo; behaviour.</p><p>Although noble at heart, the way they strive to achieve gender equality is absolutely ridiculous on most occasions. How many times have we heard things such as &ldquo;Check your privilege&rdquo; or &ldquo;Girls only date bastards&rdquo; from these individuals? I have gotten sick of such statements and every time someone uses similar phrases to shut down my argument, I simply leave because I know I&rsquo;m wasting my time trying to argue with someone who can&rsquo;t be argued with.</p><p>Nevertheless, without taking into consideration these two biased groups, there are, indeed, issues that discriminate against both men and women. As an example, when a couple files for divorce, the judges are usually biased towards women, in the sense that they receive more of the common fortune that the couple have shared. The bias is also strong when it comes to custody cases, as there are more men who lose their children and have to pay alimony fees. However, women are discriminated against when it comes to looks. The standard of beauty among women is so high that many feel insecure about themselves, so they try to buy as many fancy clothes as possible and wear cosmetics constantly.</p><p>Furthermore, there are certain tasks in which either men or women are by default expected to perform better against the other gender. Men are more expected to be able to carry more weights than a woman, whilst women are expected to cook much better than men do. I think we have all met at least a few times in life cases where it was actually quite the opposite. Sure, biologically speaking, our bodies are built differently and our brains function somewhat distinctive, but it is not always the case that a certain gender has more grip on a certain task than the other. I think people should simply have the common sense to not discriminate against others, but as we all know, it&rsquo;s not possible, so we have to work together to educate others and know that both genders have their own struggles.</p><h2 id="heading-zmg4z" title="ID: heading-zmg4z" data-guid="679bc859-0fa6-4487-a688-00797987b1a6">Essay about justice</h2><p>Dacă vreodată ai fost pus în situația să faci dreptate, cu siguranță ești familiar cu tema prezentată în Essay about justice. Trăind într-o lume în care moralitatea este subiectivă atât de la un individ la altul cât și de la o țară la alta, Essay about justice aduce în discuție câteva idei menite să pună la încercare compasul moral al fiecăruia dintre noi. Fie că vrei să te focusezi pe dreptatea individuală, fie că vrei să discuți sistemul de justiție oficial, eseul are ce iți trebuie pentru a-ți pune la încercare convingerile.</p><h3 id="heading-n8pfd" title="ID: heading-n8pfd">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.&rdquo;</p><p>What is justice? How could we define it? There are too many factors to take into consideration before one could find a universal definition for it. Loosely, it can be defined as the idea of moral equity and fairness. You may have heard the now famous slogan &ldquo;Justice is blind&rdquo;, but what is its meaning? Given the subjective nature of this metaphor, one might wrongly assume that justice doesn&rsquo;t know anything. In actuality, it means that true justice doesn&rsquo;t care how you look, what race or gender you are or what your social status is.</p><p>I think everyone can agree that a person who commits a crime needs to be punished. But then again, depending on where you live, laws can get ridiculous. In certain states of the US, you can get a fine for selling raw milk or collecting rainwater. I don&rsquo;t think any person in their right mind would want to punish someone for such &ldquo;offenses&rdquo;. Is it just to punish someone simply because of illegality? Or is there a more advanced ethical code behind justice? I think the latter option is the most probable answer when it comes to true, unbiased equity.</p><p>Should a person be sent to jail for killing someone? Well, in most cases, the answer is yes. But, there are several situations that require some analysis on the matter. What if the killing was in self-defence? What if the victim was planning to shoot people? Taking these things into consideration, the matter becomes more complicated than previously thought. If done in legitimate self-defence, killing should be the last option possible. However, if all else fails, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to condemn the person who was simply defending themselves from an attack.</p><p>Furthermore, if there is evidence of a psychopath who&rsquo;s planning to go out on a killing spree, murdering the suspect wouldn&rsquo;t be wise. Instead, preventive methods should be used, such as arresting the individual and investigating all the possible details of the matter. In cases where that isn&rsquo;t possible and said individual is already pulling a gun out, then shooting the target before getting the chance to kill innocent civilians would be a better option than letting others die. As you can see, solutions to problems exist, but it&rsquo;s all a matter of timing and tension of the moment. Indeed, justice is complicated.</p><p>But is justice limited only to killing? Of course not. There are several other crimes that are ethically unacceptable. Crimes such as fraud, stealing, kidnapping, human trafficking and others are just as horrific and need to be punished.</p><p>In the end, no one should be above others in the justice system. Whomever decides to negatively affect other human lives deserves to get punished for their acts. If you see an injustice being committed, don&rsquo;t hesitate to interfere or call for help, because serving justice is a huge way of helping the world become a better place.</p><h2 id="heading-owf0w" title="ID: heading-owf0w" data-guid="81fb4925-5497-493d-8d71-75ca0545ef4a">Essay about public transport</h2><p>Essay about public transport este o lucrare care descrie unul dintre sistemele importante ale unui oraș modern, transportul în comun. Deși există păreri pozitive și negative, Essay about public transport ne prezintă perspectivele ambelor tabere, cu o usoară înclinație în favoarea transportului în comun datorită prețului și eficienței.</p><h3 id="heading-33slf" title="ID: heading-33slf">Essay</h3><p>Public transportation is a good and cheap solution for going from one place to another, especially in a crowded city or on long distances. By standard definition, public transport is composed of vehicles that can carry several people on fixed routes for a certain price and that are available for public access.</p><p>These vehicles can range anywhere from busses and trolleys to trains, ships and airplanes. The main reasons why people use public transport instead of private transport is because it is cheap, affordable and efficient. In crowded cities, public transport assures that you avoid the stress that comes with driving through agglomerated areas or finding a parking space and it is faster than traveling by foot. On longer distances, it has the advantage of being cheaper than choosing to go with your personal car, if you have one to begin with.</p><p>With that said, public transport does have its fair share of disadvantages as well. Although cheap, there is a constant lack of privacy and space, especially at rush hour. Not to mention the fact that certain individuals&rsquo; odour is unpleasant, especially during summer when people sweat excessively because of the heat. In certain situations, you might not even have where to sit, so you have to stand up and use the support handles to avoid tripping over others at high speeds or at abrupt stops.</p><p>At long distances, these issues are accentuated by the fact that even if you do have a seat, it is not comfortable enough to sleep properly. Sure, you might say that you don&rsquo;t have the luxury of sleeping while you&rsquo;re driving your own personal car, but you can always find a parking space and rest until you are able to drive again. In public transport, you cannot do that, you have to depend on the driver&rsquo;s schedule for breaks. Speaking of this, your bus or train might not even leave you at the exact place where you want to go, so you are forced to travel the rest of the distance by foot.</p><p>Being inside a vehicle with a packed crowd also represents a huge danger in case of emergency. Having to squeeze through many people to get to an exit is very inconvenient and can get dangerous if, for example, a fire starts. To contrast this, if a fire starts in your own personal vehicle, you can always stop driving and get out before anything else occurs, but if you&rsquo;re unlucky enough to experience such cases in public transport, it will be much harder to escape.</p><p>Even with these flaws, the fact that public transport takes you to various different locations faster than walking by foot and the fact that it is formidably cheaper than owning and operating a personal vehicle makes it a viable option both for long distance travellers and those who have to go through heavy traffic in cities.</p><h2 id="heading-09ygt" title="ID: heading-09ygt" data-guid="1fb0708e-ee26-4460-abd3-e61a27cb31d6">Essay about relationships</h2><p>Essay about relationships este o lucrare în care se vorbește despre un aspect de bază prezent în viața oricărei persoane, relațiile. Fie că vorbim de prieteni, iubiți, cunoștințe, colegi sau membri de familie, Essay about relationships ne spune că avem o un tip diferit de relație cu fiecare, cu aspecte, atitudini, vocabulare și gesturi diferite. Essay about relationships este un eseu de nota 10 care prezintă relațiile dintr-o perspectivă cât mai obiectivî, promovând comunicarea, încrederea, respectul și interesele comune, ca baze ale oricărei relații de succes, fiind in același timp o sursă de inspirație excelentă pentru oricine dorește să scrie o lucrare corectă și coerentă.</p><h3 id="heading-gre22" title="ID: heading-gre22">Essay</h3><p>Relationships are bonds formed between humans of all kind. They can vary from romantic relationships, to family relationships, interpersonal relationships and so on. Relationships can give meaning to life, as they are the result of people needing one another for different reasons that can range from emotional support to love, to well-being.</p><p>There are excellent or good relationships, as well as mediocre, bad or abusive. The main attributes of relationships are communication, trust, respect and things in common. Conversations are vital not just in relationships, but with all sorts of human interactions. It is the way we express emotions, thoughts, ideas, stories, questions, etc. If we didn&rsquo;t communicate we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to form any sort of bond with other humans the same way, we do by communication.</p><p>First of all, we need communication in order to establish all sort of relationships and thus form bonds with people. Unlike family relatives, your relationships with other people only begins once you start a discussion with them. Friends, lovers and so forth don&rsquo;t appear overnight, without direct interaction between two people. Communication is the first step into revealing whether two people share the other three pillars necessary in a fruitful relationship: trust, respect and things in common.</p><p>Trust is another big issue because it can be easily broken. We put trust in people to show them that we are confident in our relationship with said person. Gaining one&rsquo;s trust comes at a price, though. People don&rsquo;t trust you simply from day one. You have to respect them and show them reasons for trusting you. It is way easier to break someone&rsquo;s trust than to gain it, and once broken, that trust can no longer be repaired to its fullest. This also gives us important life lessons, such as the fact that some things are hard to obtain and we should cherish them instead of being careless, because they can also be easily lost.</p><p>Respect is yet another important aspect in a relationship. Whether it&rsquo;s about the relationship between students and teachers, children and parents or love relationships, respect shows just how much you value a certain individual. It shows them that, in your views, both of your roles play an important part in maintaining a good connection. If your relationships lack respect, then something or someone is clearly not right. Be sure to avoid people who don&rsquo;t respect and view you as an equal.</p><p>Finally, having things in common is highly recommended in relationships. Even if you are related to someone without any input on your part, such as being blood relatives, you still have a certain thing in common which bonds you to them: they are part of your family. But when it comes to friendships or love affairs, finding things that you both like is necessary for discussion and maintenance of your connection.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these pillars are essential to having a healthy relationship, no matter what type it is. The next time you feel that a certain person is not right for you, check these four aspects above all else and conclude for yourself whether a relationship with someone is good or bad for you. Don&rsquo;t take wonderful relationships for granted, because finding people with whom you can connect is difficult.</p><h2 id="heading-79een" title="ID: heading-79een" data-guid="436704ab-5950-4f9f-a591-b1f8aab390d8">Essay about o<span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">verpopulation and climate change</span></h2><p>Man-made environmental change, most likely due to the buildup of emitted greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is perhaps the most comprehensive threat to the planet. Even though most people have begun to address the problem, and try to act by decreasing their carbon footprint through reduced consumption and usage of green technology, another global challenge can cause climate change to grow at an even quicker pace. The issue of overpopulation is easily able to overwhelm the previously mentioned efforts, and might be the very factor that, among other things, can make the tall glass of environmental disruption finally overflow its edges.</p><p>Rapid human population growth, or overpopulation, puts a huge pressure on almost every aspect of the area it occurs in. From a small scale point of view, overpopulation has consequences like growing unemployment rates, increase in extreme poverty and a wear and tear of the local infrastructure. However, if we look at it as a global challenge, we find that overpopulation, especially urban overpopulation, causes a lot of chain reactions which are not necessarily too positive. More and more water resources, forests and other land areas are over exploited all around the world, due to the constant need for increased extraction of resources. More people means more mouths to feed, more houses to build, more consumers, but less things left for everyone. A scarcity of resources is severely unfortunate, considering all of the following generations that deserve a chance to experience this planet.</p><p>Climate change is known to be one of the most urgent issues the world deals with today. With huge campaigns and fundraisers, support from several celebrities, both major and minor, and dreadful declarations of the future, environmental change has naturally gained a lot of attention worldwide. However, other global challenges like the energy crisis or extreme poverty do not usually cause the same amount of agitation, even though they arguably are equally threatening to the sustainability of the globe. Overpopulation is yet another challenge that suffers from a state of under-publicity. Most people are not even aware of the primary consequences of overpopulation. Not aware of the fact that it strongly correlates with other global issues like food shortage, problems with health care, water shortage and poverty. And you guessed right, there is also a strong correlation between overpopulation and climate change. But if people are not willing to look at different aspects of a case, look past the &ldquo;shocking headlines&rdquo;, how is this issue supposed to be dealt with? A lot depends on how well people are informed, how well lighten up people are about several global issues, not just one. But it is important to remember that this responsibility does not lie with the man in the street.</p><p>Independent media plays an extremely important role when it comes to fighting an issue, especially when it strikes on a global scale. The media has the power to inform the general population on what is going on. Ideally, it provides people with enough information so they can make up their mind about the issue themselves. If a lot of people share the same opinion, a public perception can rise. This can be a very powerful tool, and often force politicians and other leaders to act on their behalf, even if the public opinion collides with what they originally had in mind. By this logic, it is the media who holds the responsibility of informing more wide-ranging about challenges like overpopulation, even though it might not attract as many readers as the screaming headings about climate change to begin with.</p><p>The world deals with a lot of major problems these days, and most of them interfere more with each other than people tend to realize. Overpopulation leads to a lack of resources, which leads to an energy crisis, which takes us to how we want to preserve the earth, which ultimately leads us to the headlines about climate change and how much time we have left. Global population growth accelerates all of these issues. So perhaps we need to conclude with the fact that just smaller carbon footprints is not enough, we might need fewer feet.</p><h2 id="heading-frrx0" title="ID: heading-frrx0" data-guid="9f857c2b-0585-42d7-aca4-633e827dd16a">Essay about equality</h2><p>In the western world most women are treated equal to men, this however is not the case all over the world. In many poor developing countries, girls simply do not get the same opportunities as boys. To European children, boy or girl, education is a matter of course. Everyone are put through compulsory schooling and get the opportunity to take a higher education or a vocational subject.&nbsp;</p><p>In India girls are even sometimes viewed as a burden because when a girl gets married it is the girl&rsquo;s family who covers all the expenses and that makes marriage a large item of expenditure for families with many girls.&nbsp;</p><p>In Bangladesh most girls are taken out of school when or before they reach puberty. This is to prevent them from getting boyfriends, because if that would happen, the chances of being married off to a boy from a wealthy family drops. Marriages in the western and eastern world are two very different things. In the western world, marriage is seen as the union of two people because they love each other. In the eastern world marriage is seen as the union of two families and many marriages are arranged by the family, often the people getting married haven&rsquo;t even met each other until their wedding day.&nbsp;</p><p>Religion also plays a key role in oppressing women, in many Muslim countries around the world, women are completely deprived of their rights.&nbsp; Islam is probably the single biggest reason for women being suppressed today. The view of women in the Koran is very depreciatory. Women in Muslim countries are often not allowed to even speak to a man that she is not closely related to. In some countries women don&rsquo;t even have a life outside the home, but is forced to stay home. When women go out they usually have to wear something that covers their hair and partially their face, and in some countries they have to wear a burka. A burka is an attire where you can only see the eyes of the person wearing it. If you go on holiday to a Muslim country, you would se women and girls at the beach swimming in clothes covering their whole body so that they don&rsquo;t show any skin.</p><p>In Europe and the rest of the western world, women have the exact same rights as men, and it is illegal to judge somebody on the basis of their sex. Women in the west are as independent as men because they have an education and therefore the ability to earn money. In poor developing countries and in many Muslim countries it is often only the man who has a job, and this makes the woman completely dependent on him in order to survive. Through education and the ability to earn money and make a living independently, women got their rights in the west and this is how they will eventually get them in the developing countries of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the west has come very far in terms of equality between the sexes, we do still have a few more steps to go. Comparative studies show that between men and women in the same executive positions, men always have a higher salary. This is something we must strive to eliminate in the west. While in the poor developing countries of the world, equal educational opportunities are the highest concern.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay/famous-person" title="Essay about a famous person | Nelson Mandela, J.K.Rowling, Bill Gates" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about a famous person</span></a><a href="/essay/seasons" title="Essay about seasons | autumn, winter" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about seasons</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Global warming is a problem caused by too much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which basically acts as a blanket, trapping heat and thus warming the planet. This makes the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface become gradually hotter with each passing year, as we have seen a rise in average global temperatures in the last decade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShould we be really concerned with such an issue, considering the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s not the first time the climate has changed on this planet\u0026rsquo;s lifetime? Well, yes. Because this sort of change ultimately affects every creature\u0026rsquo;s way of living on the planet. This time it\u0026rsquo;s particularly different, because the climate is being changed directly by human input. One of the biggest problems global warming brings us is the rising of the sea level. This could result in the flooding of low lying coastal areas and cities, such as Egypt, the Netherlands, and Bangladesh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe heat wave and subsequent melting of the ice caps might not be the only problem. Another dilemma cause by global warming is represented by changes in weather patterns. Many areas around the globe, especially island-type locations might soon be experiencing hurricanes and floods more often due to the rising sea levels. Climate change will also have a huge impact on animals, as fish population might decline and insects might grow in numbers. Needless to say, polar bears, penguins, seals and other animals that live in cold areas will be extremely affected by these changes. Overall, predictions don\u0026rsquo;t look good.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what can we do to stop this? There are several ways to solve this issue, though none of them are absolutely perfect. Planting more trees is the obvious choice, because trees absorb CO2 and give out oxygen, which is beneficial for humans and other animals. Secondly, switching from a fuel-powered car to an electric one would be recommended, but the prices for electric vehicles is too steep for the majority of people\u0026rsquo;s pockets. Switching from coal operated power plants to nuclear, wind turbines or solar panels is one more solution to add to the list, but those aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect either.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWind turbines have a bad habit of overloading when there\u0026rsquo;s too much wind, thus causing possible short circuits. Solar panels work best when there\u0026rsquo;s lots of sunlight, so they\u0026rsquo;re not going to be efficient during the winter. Nuclear power plants represent a high risk if not operated correctly, as seen in the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents in 1986 and 2011, respectively. Is there a perfect solution to this problem? Sadly, no. We might have to wait a few more years before someone discovers new ways of improving the situation, but until then, it is worth trying to protect the planet as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-pfkdg\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-pfkdg\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c53b17a2-9ad7-43c3-8bca-8ba2981096ad\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about deforestation\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about deforestation este o lucrare care atrage atenția asupra tăierii copacilor, o problemă care devine din ce în ce mai gravă în ultimii ani. Deși departe de a fi o problemă care să prezinte un pericol la scară mare, Essay about deforestation prezintă pericolele care apar în zonele unde se taie copacii, de ce apar aceste pericole, precum și soluții care ar putea ameliora situația. Essay about deforestation este o lucrare care caută să atragă atenția asupra unei probleme ecologice destul de importante\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-cond6\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-cond6\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagine Earth without forests and think about what effects that may have on the planet. Deforestation is, at a basic level, just that: the disappearance of forests, or parts of forests from the planet that we call home. How and why does it occur? Mainly, deforestation occurs because of humans. We take for granted the natural resources we have, often forgetting to replenish them. In more common terms, we cut down trees without planting others in their place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think most people already know the answer to why we cut down trees. The more complicated question is \u0026ldquo;why don\u0026rsquo;t we plant others in their place?\u0026rdquo; However you look at the situation, cutting down trees is a somewhat necessary evil. We cut down trees in order to produce paper, which we use for all sorts of different tasks. We cut them down because in certain places, people still need to use wood for making a fire and keeping a decent temperature during winter, because not all places have access to gas or electric heating. We cut down trees in order to build houses and shelters and all sorts of other buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasically, cutting down trees is necessary in order to maintain a modern standard of living. But what are the effects caused by deforestation? For a start, trees output the oxygen that we so desperately need in order to survive. They do this by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, thus lessening the impact that greenhouse gasses have on the planet and putting a minor stop on global warming. Secondly, erosion is likely to occur in places where deforestation takes place at an alarming rate. NASA\u0026rsquo;s Earth Observatory even went as far as claiming that if deforestation maintains its current rate, we might see the disappearance of rainforests within 100 years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow is our country handling this problem? Not too good. Many of our mountain regions seem to have lost a lot of trees. The earth in those areas keeps eroding faster and faster, causing landslides and thus affecting the entire area around those parts. We have to deal not only with companies who exploit these resources, but with people who also cut down trees in the forest for their own gain. As stated earlier, this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a huge problem if people planted trees after they cut some down, but they don\u0026rsquo;t do this. Either they don\u0026rsquo;t care or they don\u0026rsquo;t realise what a threat this represents for all of us.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat can we do in order to stop this? The simplest solution, and I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough, is to plant more trees. Although preferably, we should stop cutting down trees, that option isn\u0026rsquo;t too feasible in the real world due to the necessity of wood. Gather a group of friends and go out there and plant as many trees as possible, for you will be doing yourself and the whole world a huge favour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-oxme1\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-oxme1\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f2159614-fe28-49e6-ba56-99bea1c6868c\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about pollution\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eDacă ai aruncat vreodată ambalaje pe jos, Essay about pollution are să-ți transmită câteva idei.

However, we should do our best to ensure that we pollute as less as humanly possible. But to do so, we must first know what exactly causes pollution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst and foremost, the biggest amount of pollution comes from the industrial complex and cars. Coal power stations and fuel operated vehicles release carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, producing a greenhouse effect and thus causing global warming. Not only that, but the gasses emitted by such sources also make the air uneasy and unpleasant to breathe for both humans and animals. I used to live near a coal operated power station and I can tell you first-hand that it is truly horrifying when you go back to such a place after visiting an area with almost zero air pollution, such as a forest or a village.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, we pollute the environment by throwing trash such as plastic into oceans and in the environment in general. This is extremely dangerous for the wildlife, as fish, for example, could get caught in plastic bags and be trapped there for the rest of their life, as plastic only degrades in a huge amount of time. There have also been cases of oil spills inside oceans, which have negatively affected these animals, causing parts of the water to be uninhabitable and undrinkable. This is a direct effect of people\u0026rsquo;s negligence and lack of care for the environment, unlike the former case, where we need coal powered stations to have electricity or cars to transport people and goods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are also other smaller forms of pollution that can be easily overcome, such as noise pollution and light pollution, which both implicate a higher than necessary level of sound and artificial light, respectively. However, the first two forms of pollution are very serious and directly affect the environment. You may ask yourself in what way can we end this. The obvious solution would be to replace coal power stations with wind turbines, solar panels or nuclear power plants. Classic cars could also be replaced by electric vehicles. All of these have the advantage of significantly reducing pollution, but they are not perfect, because they are not cost-efficient and can fail easily in certain situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution to avoiding plastic pollution would be to recycle and make as many packages biodegradable. But making every type of package biodegradable is not perfect either, because most products need a long shelf life, and having the surprise of the package of milk, for instance, degrading overnight would be yet another problem. So, the only real and efficient problem solver would be recycling. People should be encouraged to recycle as much as they can instead of throwing absolutely everything in the trash bin. Fortunately, there are many organizations that offer users the possibility to recycle a vast amount of materials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe might not be perfect at combating pollution, but we are getting there. People need to realize how important the protection of the environment is and do their part in keeping it clean. Researchers all around the globe are working hard to find more and more possible solutions for this problem. It is only a matter of time until we can finally reach the point where we can proudly say that the planet is pollution-free. I hope that the time comes sooner rather than later, because otherwise the planet will slowly decay, and it\u0026rsquo;s not as if we have any other planet where we could move to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8jia7\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-8jia7\u0022 data-guid=\u00225f59dab5-bb6f-4cb1-b65a-fb3ef809457d\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about the environment\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about the enviroment este o lucrare care subliniază legătura dintre om și mediul înconjurător.

Obviously, these issues are important and something needs to be done in order to suppress them, Luckily, there are quite a few organizations out there that are striving to resolve them as quickly and efficiently as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most common issue that people are talking about is the pollution caused by cars. Indeed, carbon dioxide emissions affect the planet\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere, thus enhancing the global warming effect, but some solutions are not as good as others. For example, The European Union proposed a carbon tax for car drivers, yet that has neither stopped people from buying cars, nor has it slowed down the gas\u0026rsquo; effects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrivate companies, such as Tesla Motors, on the other hand, have come with a much more reasonable solution: produce electric cars. These vehicles operate exclusively on electricity and can easily replace a normal vehicle, but their downside is that they are quite expensive, at least for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way to pollute the air is by having coal operated power stations. People who live in industrial parts of a city know this very well, as they often complain about the smell. The solutions proposed by the majority of environmental agencies are solar panels and wind turbines, but those are not yet perfect either. Yes, they generate current without polluting the environment, but solar panels tend to fail during winter times, when the Sun\u0026rsquo;s rays are at minimum. On the other hand, wind turbines tend to overload when the wind is too strong, thus causing a high risk to short circuit people\u0026rsquo;s devices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNuclear power plants are mostly risk-free if operated correctly, but people tend to stigmatize those because of the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents. This raises yet another, more frightening issue, one which could have brought the end of the world back during the days of The Cold War. Atomic energy could prove very useful if handled correctly, for the good reasons, but in the wrong hands it can do way more harm than good, as proven in the last century. Out of all these potential solutions against pollution, none are perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is clear that we need to further research potential ways to prevent pollution. Like all scientific wonders, this may be a task that could take a few more years to perfect, but as we have seen in the past, with gadgets and technology in general, what may seem science fiction today, might be the reality of tomorrow, so we should never abandon the hope of a cleaner planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, we should always try to protect the environment, as this planet is our home. Although none of the solutions are perfect, we should all strive to achieve the ultimate goal of keeping the Earth clean and accessible to all beings, not just humans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ur34y\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-8jia7\u0022 data-guid=\u00225f59dab5-bb6f-4cb1-b65a-fb3ef809457d\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about unemployment\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about unemployment este o lucrare care vizează un subiect intâlnit aproape în fiecare țară, șomajul.

The causes can be numerous and vary from region to region. Of course, like with any problem, there are several possible solutions meant to resolve this issue. The first major problem that obstructs people from getting a job is the lack of skills that are valuable on the labour market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople often seek jobs as soon as they leave high school, without taking into consideration the fact that high school barely qualifies people for low paying jobs at best. Even some faculties are guilty of this, as the skills that they teach people, although valuable from some perspectives, are worthless when it comes to getting a job. This brings us to yet another issue which is similar to the first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are too many people that go to universities, seeking jobs in domains that are too heavily crowded. Statistics show that in our country, the journalism industry is full, yet students go to journalism faculties, thus creating even more jobless graduates, while faculties such as chemistry, engineering and other similar domains are almost empty, even though the labour market in those sectors needs more skilled people to employ. Of course, this is due to the fact that those faculties are hard and necessitate a lot of work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother issue might be that the market is too heavily influenced by government regulation. A friend of mine tried to open a restaurant last year and I have seen first-hand how hard it is to do such a thing. The laws are numerous and exhausting. The taxes and tariffs are overwhelming, especially for the small businesses who are barely getting off their feet. If we want to create more jobs for people who seek them, then we need to deregulate the laws that make it hard for people to open and run their own business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother problem that comes from the government is the imposing of a certain minimum wage and economic inflation. Most major currencies around the globe have slowly lost their initial value due to these problems. Although this statement might upset some people, artificially increasing people\u0026rsquo;s salaries automatically makes prices go up in order to maintain competitiveness, thus creating inflation and the overall value loss that most currencies have suffered throughout the last decades.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf these issues don\u0026rsquo;t get fixed, then unemployment will continue to haunt us forever. The fact that social security and welfare have gotten so high is yet another reason why many choose to stay on government benefits instead of seeking work. Personally, I think that government should stop intervening so much in the market and just let it be free and do its own thing. When we look at countries where the market doesn\u0026rsquo;t have government imposed impediments, such as Switzerland, we see that the salaries get high without having steep prices. Free the markets and you will free the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-fyk36\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-fyk36\u0022 data-guid=\u00221ba88221-1961-4a16-89c8-6ca249006183\u0022\u003eEssay about junk food\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about junk food este o lucrare care ne îndeamnă să aruncăm o privire mai atentă la subiectul fast-food-ului sau \u0026rdquo;mâncării la minut\u0026rdquo;.

However, not every type of food is healthy, especially in large doses. Even healthy foods can have certain side effects if consumed in huge quantities. Just imagine how bad junk food is in that regard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEating food is the equivalent of refuelling your car\u0026rsquo;s gas tank. We need it in order to operate at our best during the day, but just like how you have to be careful what type of fuel you put in your car, you also have to be careful what type of food you put in your body. Keep in mind that eating junk food from time to time isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily bad if you calculate your calories, fats and sugars correctly, but eating it on a daily or almost daily basis can have several negative effects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, because of all the fats inside cooking oil and fries, your arteries could get clogged up, thus forcing your heart to work harder in order to make blood circulate through your veins normally. This is an especially risky issue because it increases the risk of heart disease, failure or cardiac arrest. Sure, you can eliminate fats and calories through vigorous exercise, however, the more you have, the more you need to work harder in order to cleanse your body from it all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEating lots of sweets will inevitably increase the sugar levels in your blood, thus adding a huge risk for developing diabetes. This is a serious disease than can affect a person\u0026rsquo;s everyday life and requires special injectable treatment known as insulin in order to keep all the body\u0026rsquo;s functions at a normal, sustainable level. Needless to say, treatment can get expensive, as you may need several doses on a daily basis, depending on how aggravate your situation has become.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, your body can get fat quite quickly. This in itself is a major issue, but it does also bring its fair share of other problems. You tend to sweat a lot when there\u0026rsquo;s too much heat, you become less athletic and more prone to tiring quickly, your heart needs to pump a lot more blood in order to maintain your organs, thus being more prone to causing immense blood pressure and other similar problems. Do not allow yourself to go to this level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEat healthy, try to abstain yourself from temptations and only eat at fast food restaurants as a last option. There\u0026rsquo;s no serious risk present in eating such snacks from time to time, but do try to keep things very clean in general. Try eating salads, vegetables, fruits and drinking only natural juices on a daily basis. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget your meat intake, because meat does have its benefits, such as protein, which carves muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, a balanced diet, rigorous exercise and a patience of steel are required to have a healthy, normal life, with all the benefits that other fit humans also have, such as athletic abilities, speed and agility and lots of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-b99fs\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-b99fs\u0022 data-guid=\u002299f3c4b4-2f9e-4df8-92bb-e68c4565cd1e\u0022\u003eEssay about globalisation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrimești pe un calculator fabricat în China, asamblat în Germania și testat în România un mail din America pentru a confirma comanda pentru tricoul ce l-ai comandat din Taiwan.

It aims to do so by establishing certain international laws and deals which would then enact these goals. However, not all aspects of globalization are necessarily good. Some of them may seem good on paper, but can turn out as disastrous in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are several branches to this phenomenon: cultural globalization, economic globalization, political globalization, military globalization and environmental globalization. The first three get the most attention from academicians. How do these practices affect people overall? Let\u0026rsquo;s explore the both the good and the bad from each.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomic globalization is the dream of any entrepreneur. It alleviates most of the taxes and impediments required in order to sell or buy items from other countries, thus allowing a freer trade than before. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever bought something online from a different country, chances are you already know how much of a pain shipping costs can be, unless you got a free shipping offer from a major website that can afford to cover up those costs for you. The downside to this approach is that smaller businesses might not thrive as well depending on the current established laws set by international treaties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCultural globalization means exchanging ideas about different cultures with people from all over the world. This also includes migrations, which in itself can be both good and bad. A good example of migration would be when people go to work in other countries, to fill in the manpower needed in order to sustain the ever growing labor market. However, some migrate in order to get welfare. This helps them on a personal level, but on the big economic scale it affects the rest of us, because in certain countries people who live on welfare might actually have more money than someone who works a low-end job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe political, military and environmental forms of globalization are heavily intertwined. The ultimate goal is to assure peace between all countries, offer support for those who are at war and protect the environment. Nevertheless, politicians are also human and they tend to make quite a lot of mistakes when it comes to these issues.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving a certain political power such as the EU involved in every member country\u0026rsquo;s policy will inevitably have an impact on their sovereignty. While local politicians can be voted for and held accountable, the people in Brussels have almost nothing to fear, which begs the question if they should even have such control over others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, when it comes to environmental issues, the solutions which were proposed aren\u0026rsquo;t that great. Taxing people based on their car\u0026rsquo;s carbon emissions hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped them from buying them and environmental friendly power sources are not too sustainable. What we need is to discuss these problems and come up with better solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, globalization is both good and bad. The key to it being successful is to actually implement the things that work great about it and fix the things that do not work so great. Whatever your stance might be on this subject, it is important to share your ideas in order to come up with better results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4mg1m\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-4mg1m\u0022 data-guid=\u00224cff7c66-364e-4166-bf02-566d58cb45e6\u0022\u003eEssay about water\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about water este o lucrare despre unul dintre elementele indispensabile vieții, apa.

Our bodies are made up mostly of water, which further shows how important it is. Life on earth would practically be impossible without water\u0026rsquo;s existence. With this said, I find it mind-blowing that people tend to waste water or pollute it, especially that in other parts of the world, people aren\u0026rsquo;t as lucky as we are. Yes, surprisingly there are places where water is scarce, and this is a huge problem for the population in such areas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWater scarcity is a huge problem in places such as Africa or desert areas. Due to extreme temperature and lack of rain, people often have to walk long distances to find an oasis or a lake, which makes living in such areas very hard. Without water, our body dehydrates and slowly but surely starts dying. It\u0026rsquo;s sad to think about this kind of stuff, considering that we live in a country that has no such problem. We should be thankful that we live in a place where water can be found so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is somewhat paradoxical to think that an element which gives life can also kill. There are, unfortunately, many cases where people drown in water. I think it\u0026rsquo;s absurd that that although we live on a planet which is covered mostly by water, we as humans don\u0026rsquo;t know how to swim by default. It is a skill that we have to earn through exercise. Imagine how much of the bottom of the oceans we have not explored due to our inability to breathe underwater. Granted, the pressure would kill us instantaneously if we were to dive that deep, but one can only wonder what life forms lie in the abyss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, alas, we are simply made to live on land and just drink water, not live in it. So, what can we do in order to preserve this precious element? First and foremost, we need to stop wasting it so much. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t leave the tap or the shower on when we\u0026rsquo;re not using them. Although plentiful in our country, it is not wise to waste something so important. Imagine if water was a fairly scarce resource, like oil, for example. Not only would cost a lot more to transport and distribute water, but it\u0026rsquo;s price would also increase drastically. We are very lucky that we don\u0026rsquo;t have such a problem, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to take it for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat boggles my mind even more is the way we pollute water without even thinking about it. Why do people who go to the beach throw their trash so easily in the sea? Doing this is harmful to the ecosystem, especially to the animals who live inside that body of water. You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like it if someone came over and threw their junk into your home, so you should be more considerate about other animals\u0026rsquo; home. Water is evidently a huge part of nature, and we as humans should respect and protect nature and all of its glorious creations as much as possible. Be responsible with water, for it represents life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-1dafr\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-1dafr\u0022 data-guid=\u00227ddf8b53-7a51-4421-87d6-4a35f8fe141b\u0022\u003eEssay about obesity\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eÎncepem să auzim din ce în ce mai des despre moartea lentă a fast-food-ului, iar Essay about obesity este aici ca să pună lucrurile în perspectivă. Essay about obesity prezintă problema obezitații în lume, cauzele și efectele acesteia, dar nu uită să dea și câteva soluții, chiar dacă acestea nu se găsesc într-o pastilă minune.

Fast food and pizza restaurants are ever so popular these days and are considered the main cause of obesity apart from sedentariness. Fortunately, there are several ways a person can lose weight, though none of them are easy, and don\u0026rsquo;t be tricked by people who offer diet pills, because those have been proven to be fake and a total waste of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst and foremost, obesity has negative effects upon someone\u0026rsquo;s health. Fat and cholesterol can clog up veins and arteries, thus preventing good blood circulation and putting more pressure on the heart. Secondly, being obese makes you sweat a lot and impedes your resistance to heat, thus making it harder for you to breath or go out during hot periods. Not to mention that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look aesthetically pleasing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is even more affecting towards children, as it inhibits them from growing up healthy. But on the bright side, it is far easier to lose weight when one is young. Losing weight is no easy task, as you will need to go on a strict diet and have a stable fitness program. But if you manage to go through with these tasks, you won\u0026rsquo;t regret it. Having a healthy and beautiful body is something that everyone dreams about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only will you be less tired when doing physical activities, but you will also feel better about yourself. People will admire you for being able to put up so much effort into your looks, as everyone knows it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to maintain a good looking silhouette. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to take these advices and comparisons as offensive. No doctor or nutritionist is trying to offend you, they are trying to help you get into shape and be healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, just like with obesity, it is not healthy to be too thin either. It is necessary to keep a balance with your physique, just like anything other in life. Both excess and insufficiency are bad for us. But apart from third world countries, anorexia isn\u0026rsquo;t as spread as obesity is in developed countries. So, what can be done to combat this huge problem? I think it all comes to down to each individual\u0026rsquo;s will. No one should have the authority to restrict or impose laws on what and how much people can eat, but awareness for the issue can and should be raised.

Fiind un fenomen pe care il vedem zilnic, de la fumători înrăiți până la copii care nu pot supraviețui fără lumina sintetică a unui ecran, Essay about addiction încearcă să ajungă la sursa acestei probleme, prezentând câteva dintre posibilele motive care duc la acest rezultat. Eseul este o lucrare de calitate, scrisă dintr-o perspectivă obiectivă, care caută să pună umpic de lumină asupra unui subiect controversat în timp ce oferă cititorului o sursă de inspirație.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-zl7wu\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-zl7wu\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we think about addiction, we usually think about the constant use of hard drugs and junkies, but addiction can actually come in many forms. You probably already met quite a few people who are addicted to tobacco, or cigarettes to put it in more common terms. You most likely have colleagues who have a hard time getting up in the morning without a cup of coffee. And you\u0026rsquo;ve definitely seen alcoholics in bars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think forms addiction? Is it the fact that a certain person feels incomplete without indulging in certain substances? Is it the fact that they feel like outcasts and deal with their problems by abusing something? Or is it the simple fact that once contacting different chemicals, a sort of bond is formed which is hard to let go of? You\u0026rsquo;re inevitably going to encounter all of these possibilities when exploring addiction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThink about smokers and how they got this bad habit. Most simply started out of curiosity and end up smoking an entire pack a day, but there are some exceptions who only smoke occasionally or just smoke a few cigarettes and quit as if it was nothing. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t get addicted from the first dose of smoking, why do some people continue to do it long after that? Because smoking relieves stress and is a way of passing time. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen students quit smoking for a few months and then get right back into the game when the exam session is in full swing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, stress is a major factor when someone just can\u0026rsquo;t get enough from the first cigarette they ever put in their mouths. Otherwise, they would feel no need of doing it. The sad part is that even after the stress period has passed, if you\u0026rsquo;ve smoked a pack during that time, you will inevitably get hooked by the nicotine found within the tobacco. Quitting this habit is no easy task, as you constantly feel the need to pump some nicotine in your blood system, but there are methods that can work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTry going out with friends who don\u0026rsquo;t smoke, preferably in non-smoking areas in order to get yourself mentally prepared for quitting. In case you find that method too hard, buy yourself an electronic cigarette or nicotine patches, so that you can still get the feeling of smoking without the hazardous effects. Or you could simply do something else entirely whenever you feel the need. Either way, quit your addiction before it\u0026rsquo;s not too late.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, smoking isn\u0026rsquo;t the only addiction around here. There\u0026rsquo;s technology and internet addiction, drug addiction, alcohol addiction, social media addiction, video games addiction, gambling addiction and so on. The important part is to let go of any addiction that otherwise hinders your normal functions as a human being a start becoming better. Surround yourself with great people and good will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-bnqcq\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-bnqcq\u0022 data-guid=\u002264ed42a5-41e5-4d84-9402-c775f4c55335\u0022\u003eEssay about democracy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă ai luxul să te plângi de candidații care participă la alegeri, de drumul pâna la urnele de vot sau de zecile de fluturașe din cutia poștală cu pozele candidaților, atunci Essay about democracy îți explică de ce ar trebui să te bucuri de aceste lucruri. Văzând democrația ca pe unul dintre cele mai bune sisteme de guvernare conceput de oameni până în momentul de față, Essay about democracy încearcă să-i enumere avantajele aducând ca și termen de comparație regimurile totalitare. De asemenea, eseul nu uită să pomenească și defectele, precizând că deși este cel mai bun sistem de guvernare pe care îl avem, este departe de a fi perfect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-kvqn3\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-kvqn3\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocracy might not be a perfect system, but it is the best system that we have ever had. Living in Romania, my parents always told me about the horrors of the communist regime that took place in our beloved country. They strive to provide everything they can for me and they want to send me to a good university, so that I may get the chance that they never had under the totalitarian regime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike in other regimes, in democracy the power is divided into several parts of the government. It is not held by only one person who automatically has control over every aspect of the country\u0026rsquo;s politics and economics. The main human right and advantage that democracy offers is the ability to vote for who will govern the country, region or city and village for the following years. Elections in democratic societies are usually held every 4 or 5 years for mayors, presidents and the parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what do we do if none of the candidates are worthy for us? Should we not vote then? Actually, we should. If we don\u0026rsquo;t like any candidate, then we can always cancel our vote by putting the stamp on a plural number of candidates instead of one, or simply by submitting our paper ballot without the stamp. But why should we even bother to do this if we don\u0026rsquo;t want any candidate? We have to do it in order to avoid voter fraud. Yes, democracy isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect. There have been numerous cases where people who counted the votes have used their power to submit several more votes for a candidate on names that didn\u0026rsquo;t go to vote for the elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are also people who argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t support democracy for the simple reason that they are silenced because they are not part of a majority. Well, when it comes to voting, that is true, but in democracy minorities are viewed as important, unlike in other regimes, so those opinions are merely half informed. What is a problem is that politicians tend to do the opposite of what they promise during their campaigns. Although we vote for politicians, we do not have the power to vote over most laws that get passed in congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can we overcome this disadvantage? Well, you could always start a petition either against or for the introduction of a certain law. Although no one has absolute power in the state in a democracy, governments usually listen when a lot of people go to voice their opinion on a certain issue. Protesting has also showed major success in the past few years in our country. Even if we are insignificant in the overall political scheme, we can make our voices heard in a democracy, unlike in other regimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor me, this system is not perfect by far, but it is absolutely the best we have for now. I am thankful that I live in a democratic country instead of a totalitarian one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-frd25\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-frd25\u0022 data-guid=\u002252d02025-3ee3-406e-b184-198616e46330\u0022\u003eEssay about gender discrimination\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about gender discrimination este o lucrare care abordează un subiect de multe ori trecut cu vederea din diferite motive, discriminarea sexelor. Fiind o problemă cu care ne întâlnim zilnic și pe care în mare parte am asimilat-o în cultura și în comportamentul nostru fără să ne dăm seama, Essay about gender discrimination scoate la iveală diferitele atitudini și concepții pe care le folosim fără să ne dăm seama de efectul acestora. Essay about gender discrimination este o lucrare care atrage atenția asupra unor atitudini greșite prezente în țara noastră precum și asupra atitudinilor din aceeași categorie prezente în alte țări.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-to9vm\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-to9vm\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGender discrimination is a big problem, even in civilised societies. Both men and women are discriminated against in certain aspects of life. Too many times we hear people say such phrases as \u0026ldquo;You hit like a girl\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a man\u0026rsquo;s job\u0026rdquo;. This issue is even greater in third world countries, where women are forced to dress a certain way or marry a certain individual chosen by their parents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch discrimination can occur in the court, at the workplace, in school, at the clubs and in many other places. Even if these are still relevant issues, there are certain groups that are very vocal and exaggerate to an extreme, such as third wave feminists and men\u0026rsquo;s rights activists. These groups have a tendency to victimize themselves to an almost petty level, which makes most people think that the issues that they talk about are non-existent or don\u0026rsquo;t matter, because of the groups\u0026rsquo; behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough noble at heart, the way they strive to achieve gender equality is absolutely ridiculous on most occasions. How many times have we heard things such as \u0026ldquo;Check your privilege\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Girls only date bastards\u0026rdquo; from these individuals? I have gotten sick of such statements and every time someone uses similar phrases to shut down my argument, I simply leave because I know I\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time trying to argue with someone who can\u0026rsquo;t be argued with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, without taking into consideration these two biased groups, there are, indeed, issues that discriminate against both men and women. As an example, when a couple files for divorce, the judges are usually biased towards women, in the sense that they receive more of the common fortune that the couple have shared. The bias is also strong when it comes to custody cases, as there are more men who lose their children and have to pay alimony fees. However, women are discriminated against when it comes to looks. The standard of beauty among women is so high that many feel insecure about themselves, so they try to buy as many fancy clothes as possible and wear cosmetics constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, there are certain tasks in which either men or women are by default expected to perform better against the other gender. Men are more expected to be able to carry more weights than a woman, whilst women are expected to cook much better than men do. I think we have all met at least a few times in life cases where it was actually quite the opposite. Sure, biologically speaking, our bodies are built differently and our brains function somewhat distinctive, but it is not always the case that a certain gender has more grip on a certain task than the other. I think people should simply have the common sense to not discriminate against others, but as we all know, it\u0026rsquo;s not possible, so we have to work together to educate others and know that both genders have their own struggles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-zmg4z\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-zmg4z\u0022 data-guid=\u0022679bc859-0fa6-4487-a688-00797987b1a6\u0022\u003eEssay about justice\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă vreodată ai fost pus în situația să faci dreptate, cu siguranță ești familiar cu tema prezentată în Essay about justice. Trăind într-o lume în care moralitatea este subiectivă atât de la un individ la altul cât și de la o țară la alta, Essay about justice aduce în discuție câteva idei menite să pună la încercare compasul moral al fiecăruia dintre noi. Fie că vrei să te focusezi pe dreptatea individuală, fie că vrei să discuți sistemul de justiție oficial, eseul are ce iți trebuie pentru a-ți pune la încercare convingerile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-n8pfd\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-n8pfd\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is justice? How could we define it? There are too many factors to take into consideration before one could find a universal definition for it. Loosely, it can be defined as the idea of moral equity and fairness. You may have heard the now famous slogan \u0026ldquo;Justice is blind\u0026rdquo;, but what is its meaning? Given the subjective nature of this metaphor, one might wrongly assume that justice doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anything. In actuality, it means that true justice doesn\u0026rsquo;t care how you look, what race or gender you are or what your social status is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think everyone can agree that a person who commits a crime needs to be punished. But then again, depending on where you live, laws can get ridiculous. In certain states of the US, you can get a fine for selling raw milk or collecting rainwater. I don\u0026rsquo;t think any person in their right mind would want to punish someone for such \u0026ldquo;offenses\u0026rdquo;. Is it just to punish someone simply because of illegality? Or is there a more advanced ethical code behind justice? I think the latter option is the most probable answer when it comes to true, unbiased equity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShould a person be sent to jail for killing someone? Well, in most cases, the answer is yes. But, there are several situations that require some analysis on the matter. What if the killing was in self-defence? What if the victim was planning to shoot people? Taking these things into consideration, the matter becomes more complicated than previously thought. If done in legitimate self-defence, killing should be the last option possible. However, if all else fails, then it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be wise to condemn the person who was simply defending themselves from an attack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, if there is evidence of a psychopath who\u0026rsquo;s planning to go out on a killing spree, murdering the suspect wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be wise. Instead, preventive methods should be used, such as arresting the individual and investigating all the possible details of the matter. In cases where that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible and said individual is already pulling a gun out, then shooting the target before getting the chance to kill innocent civilians would be a better option than letting others die. As you can see, solutions to problems exist, but it\u0026rsquo;s all a matter of timing and tension of the moment. Indeed, justice is complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut is justice limited only to killing? Of course not. There are several other crimes that are ethically unacceptable. Crimes such as fraud, stealing, kidnapping, human trafficking and others are just as horrific and need to be punished.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, no one should be above others in the justice system. Whomever decides to negatively affect other human lives deserves to get punished for their acts. If you see an injustice being committed, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to interfere or call for help, because serving justice is a huge way of helping the world become a better place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-owf0w\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-owf0w\u0022 data-guid=\u002281fb4925-5497-493d-8d71-75ca0545ef4a\u0022\u003eEssay about public transport\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about public transport este o lucrare care descrie unul dintre sistemele importante ale unui oraș modern, transportul în comun. Deși există păreri pozitive și negative, Essay about public transport ne prezintă perspectivele ambelor tabere, cu o usoară înclinație în favoarea transportului în comun datorită prețului și eficienței.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-33slf\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-33slf\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePublic transportation is a good and cheap solution for going from one place to another, especially in a crowded city or on long distances. By standard definition, public transport is composed of vehicles that can carry several people on fixed routes for a certain price and that are available for public access.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese vehicles can range anywhere from busses and trolleys to trains, ships and airplanes. The main reasons why people use public transport instead of private transport is because it is cheap, affordable and efficient. In crowded cities, public transport assures that you avoid the stress that comes with driving through agglomerated areas or finding a parking space and it is faster than traveling by foot. On longer distances, it has the advantage of being cheaper than choosing to go with your personal car, if you have one to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that said, public transport does have its fair share of disadvantages as well. Although cheap, there is a constant lack of privacy and space, especially at rush hour. Not to mention the fact that certain individuals\u0026rsquo; odour is unpleasant, especially during summer when people sweat excessively because of the heat. In certain situations, you might not even have where to sit, so you have to stand up and use the support handles to avoid tripping over others at high speeds or at abrupt stops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt long distances, these issues are accentuated by the fact that even if you do have a seat, it is not comfortable enough to sleep properly. Sure, you might say that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of sleeping while you\u0026rsquo;re driving your own personal car, but you can always find a parking space and rest until you are able to drive again. In public transport, you cannot do that, you have to depend on the driver\u0026rsquo;s schedule for breaks. Speaking of this, your bus or train might not even leave you at the exact place where you want to go, so you are forced to travel the rest of the distance by foot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing inside a vehicle with a packed crowd also represents a huge danger in case of emergency. Having to squeeze through many people to get to an exit is very inconvenient and can get dangerous if, for example, a fire starts. To contrast this, if a fire starts in your own personal vehicle, you can always stop driving and get out before anything else occurs, but if you\u0026rsquo;re unlucky enough to experience such cases in public transport, it will be much harder to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven with these flaws, the fact that public transport takes you to various different locations faster than walking by foot and the fact that it is formidably cheaper than owning and operating a personal vehicle makes it a viable option both for long distance travellers and those who have to go through heavy traffic in cities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-09ygt\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-09ygt\u0022 data-guid=\u00221fb0708e-ee26-4460-abd3-e61a27cb31d6\u0022\u003eEssay about relationships\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about relationships este o lucrare în care se vorbește despre un aspect de bază prezent în viața oricărei persoane, relațiile.

They can vary from romantic relationships, to family relationships, interpersonal relationships and so on. Relationships can give meaning to life, as they are the result of people needing one another for different reasons that can range from emotional support to love, to well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are excellent or good relationships, as well as mediocre, bad or abusive. The main attributes of relationships are communication, trust, respect and things in common. Conversations are vital not just in relationships, but with all sorts of human interactions. It is the way we express emotions, thoughts, ideas, stories, questions, etc. If we didn\u0026rsquo;t communicate we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to form any sort of bond with other humans the same way, we do by communication.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, we need communication in order to establish all sort of relationships and thus form bonds with people. Unlike family relatives, your relationships with other people only begins once you start a discussion with them. Friends, lovers and so forth don\u0026rsquo;t appear overnight, without direct interaction between two people. Communication is the first step into revealing whether two people share the other three pillars necessary in a fruitful relationship: trust, respect and things in common.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrust is another big issue because it can be easily broken. We put trust in people to show them that we are confident in our relationship with said person. Gaining one\u0026rsquo;s trust comes at a price, though. People don\u0026rsquo;t trust you simply from day one. You have to respect them and show them reasons for trusting you. It is way easier to break someone\u0026rsquo;s trust than to gain it, and once broken, that trust can no longer be repaired to its fullest. This also gives us important life lessons, such as the fact that some things are hard to obtain and we should cherish them instead of being careless, because they can also be easily lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRespect is yet another important aspect in a relationship. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s about the relationship between students and teachers, children and parents or love relationships, respect shows just how much you value a certain individual. It shows them that, in your views, both of your roles play an important part in maintaining a good connection. If your relationships lack respect, then something or someone is clearly not right. Be sure to avoid people who don\u0026rsquo;t respect and view you as an equal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, having things in common is highly recommended in relationships. Even if you are related to someone without any input on your part, such as being blood relatives, you still have a certain thing in common which bonds you to them: they are part of your family. But when it comes to friendships or love affairs, finding things that you both like is necessary for discussion and maintenance of your connection.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of these pillars are essential to having a healthy relationship, no matter what type it is. The next time you feel that a certain person is not right for you, check these four aspects above all else and conclude for yourself whether a relationship with someone is good or bad for you. Don\u0026rsquo;t take wonderful relationships for granted, because finding people with whom you can connect is difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-79een\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-79een\u0022 data-guid=\u0022436704ab-5950-4f9f-a591-b1f8aab390d8\u0022\u003eEssay about o\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003everpopulation and climate change\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMan-made environmental change, most likely due to the buildup of emitted greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is perhaps the most comprehensive threat to the planet. Even though most people have begun to address the problem, and try to act by decreasing their carbon footprint through reduced consumption and usage of green technology, another global challenge can cause climate change to grow at an even quicker pace. The issue of overpopulation is easily able to overwhelm the previously mentioned efforts, and might be the very factor that, among other things, can make the tall glass of environmental disruption finally overflow its edges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRapid human population growth, or overpopulation, puts a huge pressure on almost every aspect of the area it occurs in. From a small scale point of view, overpopulation has consequences like growing unemployment rates, increase in extreme poverty and a wear and tear of the local infrastructure. However, if we look at it as a global challenge, we find that overpopulation, especially urban overpopulation, causes a lot of chain reactions which are not necessarily too positive. More and more water resources, forests and other land areas are over exploited all around the world, due to the constant need for increased extraction of resources. More people means more mouths to feed, more houses to build, more consumers, but less things left for everyone. A scarcity of resources is severely unfortunate, considering all of the following generations that deserve a chance to experience this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClimate change is known to be one of the most urgent issues the world deals with today. With huge campaigns and fundraisers, support from several celebrities, both major and minor, and dreadful declarations of the future, environmental change has naturally gained a lot of attention worldwide. However, other global challenges like the energy crisis or extreme poverty do not usually cause the same amount of agitation, even though they arguably are equally threatening to the sustainability of the globe. Overpopulation is yet another challenge that suffers from a state of under-publicity. Most people are not even aware of the primary consequences of overpopulation. Not aware of the fact that it strongly correlates with other global issues like food shortage, problems with health care, water shortage and poverty. And you guessed right, there is also a strong correlation between overpopulation and climate change. But if people are not willing to look at different aspects of a case, look past the \u0026ldquo;shocking headlines\u0026rdquo;, how is this issue supposed to be dealt with? A lot depends on how well people are informed, how well lighten up people are about several global issues, not just one. But it is important to remember that this responsibility does not lie with the man in the street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndependent media plays an extremely important role when it comes to fighting an issue, especially when it strikes on a global scale. The media has the power to inform the general population on what is going on. Ideally, it provides people with enough information so they can make up their mind about the issue themselves. If a lot of people share the same opinion, a public perception can rise. This can be a very powerful tool, and often force politicians and other leaders to act on their behalf, even if the public opinion collides with what they originally had in mind. By this logic, it is the media who holds the responsibility of informing more wide-ranging about challenges like overpopulation, even though it might not attract as many readers as the screaming headings about climate change to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world deals with a lot of major problems these days, and most of them interfere more with each other than people tend to realize. Overpopulation leads to a lack of resources, which leads to an energy crisis, which takes us to how we want to preserve the earth, which ultimately leads us to the headlines about climate change and how much time we have left. Global population growth accelerates all of these issues. So perhaps we need to conclude with the fact that just smaller carbon footprints is not enough, we might need fewer feet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-frrx0\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-frrx0\u0022 data-guid=\u00229f857c2b-0585-42d7-aca4-633e827dd16a\u0022\u003eEssay about equality\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the western world most women are treated equal to men, this however is not the case all over the world. In many poor developing countries, girls simply do not get the same opportunities as boys. To European children, boy or girl, education is a matter of course. Everyone are put through compulsory schooling and get the opportunity to take a higher education or a vocational subject.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn India girls are even sometimes viewed as a burden because when a girl gets married it is the girl\u0026rsquo;s family who covers all the expenses and that makes marriage a large item of expenditure for families with many girls.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Bangladesh most girls are taken out of school when or before they reach puberty. This is to prevent them from getting boyfriends, because if that would happen, the chances of being married off to a boy from a wealthy family drops. Marriages in the western and eastern world are two very different things. In the western world, marriage is seen as the union of two people because they love each other. In the eastern world marriage is seen as the union of two families and many marriages are arranged by the family, often the people getting married haven\u0026rsquo;t even met each other until their wedding day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReligion also plays a key role in oppressing women, in many Muslim countries around the world, women are completely deprived of their rights.\u0026nbsp; Islam is probably the single biggest reason for women being suppressed today. The view of women in the Koran is very depreciatory. Women in Muslim countries are often not allowed to even speak to a man that she is not closely related to. In some countries women don\u0026rsquo;t even have a life outside the home, but is forced to stay home. When women go out they usually have to wear something that covers their hair and partially their face, and in some countries they have to wear a burka. A burka is an attire where you can only see the eyes of the person wearing it. If you go on holiday to a Muslim country, you would se women and girls at the beach swimming in clothes covering their whole body so that they don\u0026rsquo;t show any skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Europe and the rest of the western world, women have the exact same rights as men, and it is illegal to judge somebody on the basis of their sex. Women in the west are as independent as men because they have an education and therefore the ability to earn money. In poor developing countries and in many Muslim countries it is often only the man who has a job, and this makes the woman completely dependent on him in order to survive. Through education and the ability to earn money and make a living independently, women got their rights in the west and this is how they will eventually get them in the developing countries of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though the west has come very far in terms of equality between the sexes, we do still have a few more steps to go. Comparative studies show that between men and women in the same executive positions, men always have a higher salary. This is something we must strive to eliminate in the west. While in the poor developing countries of the world, equal educational opportunities are the highest concern.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about current issues | global warming, pollution, deforestation, environment, junk food","MetaDescription":"Essay about global warming - cause and effects pune în discuție un subiect despre care am auzit deja cu toții, încălzirea globală.
