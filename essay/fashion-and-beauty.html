Luând naștere odată cu primele haine, Essay about fashion ne explică, cum moda a evoluat odată cu oamenii, fiind modelată de preferințe, mentalități și materiale de-a lungul timpului. Essay about fashion te ține la curent cu ultimele trend-uri în limba engleză, și reușește să impresioneze până și cei mai caustici critici în materie de modă literară.</p><h3 id="heading-x0ygm" title="ID: heading-x0ygm">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Fashion changes, but style endures.&rdquo;</p><p>What is fashion more exactly? Is it just a trend that keeps on changing and adapting to fit customer&rsquo;s needs or is it a form of art? Some might think it&rsquo;s both, while others may think it&rsquo;s a total waste of time and money. Whichever side you are on, fashion&rsquo;s impact on looks and society is not a thing to be ignored.</p><p>Ever since mankind discovered how to make clothing, people have been dressing in all sorts of clothes with different styles and different materials fit for each season and weather type. While this is true, not everyone had fancy clothes back in ancient times, or even medieval times for that matter. Custom tailored suits were, and to a degree they still are, a sign of high class, of richness and luxury.</p><p>Though only a small portion of the population had the opportunity to dress themselves in the finest attire, you could say that fashion had already started even from those times, even if it was not as self-aware as it is today. Now, we have an entire consumer culture regarding our wardrobes. People are no longer satisfied with wearing simple yet efficient clothes. They want the most bedazzling garments money can buy, but not just from anyone or anyplace. Today we have tons of aspiring designers and brands that have left their mark on this industry.</p><p>Does that mean that the clothes they produce are worth their prices? Most of the times the answer is a simple &ldquo;no&rdquo;, simply because you can find cheaper versions made from the same materials way more reasonably priced in other locations. But you have to admit, usually the ones who &ldquo;dress to impress&rdquo; are viewed better in society. To a certain extent, fashion affects everyone of us.</p><p>But what style of clothing should you adopt if you want to impress someone? Well, that all depends on your looks, on your personal taste and on the person you&rsquo;re trying to sway. As Coco Chanel said, fashion changes, but style endures. You do not necessarily need to indulge in overly-hyped brands in order to have style, but for most people that is a huge plus.</p><p>But why does fashion change every so often and why do older styles come back into fruition after some time?&nbsp;</p><p>That is a question that can have a variety of answers, of which all are inevitably subjective, because no matter what, everyone has their own taste and preferences. Find something that suits you and go with it. Do not let others judge you if you choose to dress differently.</p><h2 id="heading-lnyx6" title="ID: heading-lnyx6" data-guid="9d81517f-4fac-4db4-a973-d5921940925a">Essay about the importance of clothes</h2><p>Essay about the importance of clothes este o lucrare care ne explică rolul articolelor vestimentare în societatea secolului XXI. Deși nu este un articol dintr-o revistă de modă, Essay about the importance of clothes pune în evidență importanța hainelor, atât din punct de vedere tehnic, ca un izolant termic indispensabil, cât și din punct de vedere social, întărind zicala &bdquo;Haina îl face pe om&rdquo;.</p><h3 id="heading-c11h4" title="ID: heading-c11h4">Essay</h3><p>Making a good first impression is more important than one might think at first. Apart from attitude, charisma and other personal traits, clothes also help us establish a certain image about ourselves in the minds of people around us. Sure, the basic functions of clothes are to cover up our body and protect us from cold, but they have an aesthetic function that is just as important. Although some may argue that judging people based on how they dress is hypocritical, I beg to differ.</p><p>Indeed, not all of us can afford the latest fashion trends or the most expensive brands, but we can still select good looking and high quality fabrics without having to spend a lot of money. What matters most is the way we choose to dress, not what brand or how much our apparel costs. Our wardrobe directly reflects to others important aspects about our personality. The colours we choose to wear can indirectly influence others&rsquo; mood. The way we assort our clothes, what type of jackets or pants we choose to wear, and so forth, can tell a lot about how well organised or disorganised we are.</p><p>There are numerous types of clothes that we can wear for several different occasions. Whatever your taste may be, you will surely find something that suites you. Clothes come in a variety of different sizes, so everyone can find something regardless of their body type. It&rsquo;s truly marvellous to think about how clothes evolved throughout the years. There are so many materials that clothes can be made from, all with their respective advantages and disadvantages. As an example, silk looks gorgeous and is fitting for ladies going to an important, elegant event, but it&rsquo;s not too effective at keeping the body warm. Wool is effective against cold, especially in the winter season, but it tends to be itchy and doesn&rsquo;t look aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>The examples could go on forever, but the point still stands: clothes are indispensable for humans. You may not put too much effort into how you look or what type of clothes you wear, but you still wear them. They are just as important as water and food for us. But even with all of these said and done, I think the fashion industry sometimes exaggerates when promoting certain brands of clothing. As with all things, we need to find a perfect balance, one that isn&rsquo;t either too extravagant or too poor. But, alas, it is all your choice. You choose what to wear and who to impress.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-032b7" title="ID: heading-032b7" data-guid="49e60e15-d0c2-423f-ae41-a15c7c055ee7">Essay about beauty</h2><p>Essay about beauty este o lucrare care abordează un subiect vechi de când există umanitatea, frumusețea. Deși se spune că este subiectivă, Essay about beauty analizează frumusețea abordând-o din ambele perspective filosofice antice, estetica și etica, ambele având valori obiective, care pot fi bine definite, întelese și criticate. Eseul analizează caracteristicile care arată frumos pentru majoritatea lumii, cât și caracteristicile care sunt simțite ca fiind frumoase de majoritatea oamenilor.</p><h3 id="heading-m1dzo" title="ID: heading-m1dzo">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder&rdquo;</p><p>When talking about beauty, people usually refer to the physical aspect, the way a person looks. I think beauty is more complex than that and that we can find beauty in many places where we don&rsquo;t usually expect to find it. I would describe beauty as grace and charm, something that captivates us and our imagination.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to physical aspects, beauty has a lot in common with symmetry. People with symmetric faces tend to be more attractive to others than those with slight deformations. Similar to this is the way we organize our stuff. Having a well-organized bookshelf, for instance, pleases the eye, as we see all the books fit perfectly, with similar shapes and sizes. On the other hand, putting a larger book along a smaller one doesn&rsquo;t look too appealing. It might not necessarily be ugly, but you can&rsquo;t say it looks beautiful.</p><p>What other things can we define as beautiful? Even invisible characteristics have a certain beauty to them. Being kind, compassionate, hardworking, loving, caring, generous and having similar other attributes can be considered beautiful. Making others feel good about themselves is beautiful. Helping others achieve their dreams is beautiful. Basically, being a decent human being can be considered beautiful. We shouldn&rsquo;t limit ourselves to only seeing outside beauty, but instead we should also focus on understanding the beauty of a person&rsquo;s soul and personality. Too often we forget about these things and only see what lies at the surface and I think it&rsquo;s a shame to not also admire the inner beauty.</p><p>Nature is one other thing that also possesses outer beauty and inner beauty. Admiring glorious landscapes, colourful flowers, trees and all sorts of natural elements is fascinating, but what&rsquo;s even more captivating is how all these things affect the planet and us. Not only do trees look beautiful, but they also provide the oxygen that we so desperately need in order to live. Mountains and forests aren&rsquo;t just natural wonders, they are also an escape from mundane life, they offer us fresh air, peace and quiet time to meditate. Rivers offer us the opportunity of swimming and they also provide water, with which we quench our thirst. All these aspects are beautiful, in my opinion.</p><p>I think beauty can be found anywhere and within anyone, regardless of physical aspect. One more important thing that&rsquo;s worth noting is that physical beauty is subjective, as each individual has their own taste, but inner beauty is something that anyone can cherish and appreciate if given the opportunity to observe it. So let&rsquo;s try to focus on inner beauty from now on. I&rsquo;m not implying that physical beauty isn&rsquo;t important, but I think that inner beauty deserves more recognition in our overly artificial society.</p><h2 id="heading-f77bv" title="ID: heading-f77bv" data-guid="46c40934-8989-4af8-ba64-fcda5fd11f1a">Essay about love</h2><p><i>What Is Love?</i></p><p>Love is a mystery. It can change one person completely. It also gives you a warm fuzzy feeling when you are around the person you love. What might seem to be just an irrational behavior is in fact possible to explain using science. What science has found are three causes: biological, chemical and evolutionary. I think that the biological and the evolutionary causes of love are the most important as they have been a vital force for humanity to survive, thrive and multiply through time. It might not seem that essential, but love actually serves an evolutionary purpose and shows its importance as far back as four million years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first place, the primary cause of love is when Homo sapiens began walking on two legs instead of wandering around on all fours about four million years ago in Africa. This changed a lot since it was the first time human beings saw each other´s full figure. Hence, sexual organs, eye colour, the chest region amongst other things were in full display and fully visible. This contributed to new ways of making love and both looks and personal attraction became a greater part of the equation. (Toufexis 2001) Therefore, the evolution of the human starts the modern way of loving one can say.</p><p>Furthermore, back in time it was necessary to partner up with a partner. Since a human being was quite vulnerable on its own with a baby in its hands, it was dangerous for them to even forage for food.&nbsp; Thus it was critical to pair up with a mate to bring up youngsters. Romance served the evolutionary purpose of fulfilling males and females into long-term partnership, because it was important for nurturing infants as presented by Anastasia Toufexis in the article <i>The Right Chemistry</i>. Long-term relationships are a big part of love, which makes the ecological conditions a contributor to love as a survival instinct.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, in order for people to actually stay in love, one must have a baby every fourth year. This idea is called the four-year-itch, presented by anthropologist Helen Fisher. She says that primitive couples stayed together long enough to rear one child through infancy. Fisher also mentions that the &ldquo;four-year-itch&rdquo; shows up in modern societies. For instance, studies show that the divorce rate peaks around the fourth year of marriage in a handful of countries. Additional youngsters in the family then help keep pairs together. Theoretically, one kid adds four years to the current relationship. With that said the children that we make are a big part of love and in fact important to us.</p><p>To sum up: Love is in fact a strange thing. But in some way it makes sense I think. Scientifically there is evidence of the causes of love. Those are the &ldquo;four-year-itch&rdquo; and the essential to child rearing amongst other things. It has also shown its essential purpose for mankind&rsquo;s survival ecologically. Therefore, I think love was originally served as an evolutionary cause, which then makes this generation exist.

Some might think it\u0026rsquo;s both, while others may think it\u0026rsquo;s a total waste of time and money. Whichever side you are on, fashion\u0026rsquo;s impact on looks and society is not a thing to be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since mankind discovered how to make clothing, people have been dressing in all sorts of clothes with different styles and different materials fit for each season and weather type. While this is true, not everyone had fancy clothes back in ancient times, or even medieval times for that matter. Custom tailored suits were, and to a degree they still are, a sign of high class, of richness and luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough only a small portion of the population had the opportunity to dress themselves in the finest attire, you could say that fashion had already started even from those times, even if it was not as self-aware as it is today. Now, we have an entire consumer culture regarding our wardrobes. People are no longer satisfied with wearing simple yet efficient clothes. They want the most bedazzling garments money can buy, but not just from anyone or anyplace. Today we have tons of aspiring designers and brands that have left their mark on this industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes that mean that the clothes they produce are worth their prices? Most of the times the answer is a simple \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, simply because you can find cheaper versions made from the same materials way more reasonably priced in other locations. But you have to admit, usually the ones who \u0026ldquo;dress to impress\u0026rdquo; are viewed better in society. To a certain extent, fashion affects everyone of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what style of clothing should you adopt if you want to impress someone? Well, that all depends on your looks, on your personal taste and on the person you\u0026rsquo;re trying to sway. As Coco Chanel said, fashion changes, but style endures. You do not necessarily need to indulge in overly-hyped brands in order to have style, but for most people that is a huge plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut why does fashion change every so often and why do older styles come back into fruition after some time?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat is a question that can have a variety of answers, of which all are inevitably subjective, because no matter what, everyone has their own taste and preferences. Find something that suits you and go with it. Do not let others judge you if you choose to dress differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-lnyx6\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-lnyx6\u0022 data-guid=\u00229d81517f-4fac-4db4-a973-d5921940925a\u0022\u003eEssay about the importance of clothes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about the importance of clothes este o lucrare care ne explică rolul articolelor vestimentare în societatea secolului XXI. Deși nu este un articol dintr-o revistă de modă, Essay about the importance of clothes pune în evidență importanța hainelor, atât din punct de vedere tehnic, ca un izolant termic indispensabil, cât și din punct de vedere social, întărind zicala \u0026bdquo;Haina îl face pe om\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-c11h4\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-c11h4\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking a good first impression is more important than one might think at first. Apart from attitude, charisma and other personal traits, clothes also help us establish a certain image about ourselves in the minds of people around us. Sure, the basic functions of clothes are to cover up our body and protect us from cold, but they have an aesthetic function that is just as important. Although some may argue that judging people based on how they dress is hypocritical, I beg to differ.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndeed, not all of us can afford the latest fashion trends or the most expensive brands, but we can still select good looking and high quality fabrics without having to spend a lot of money. What matters most is the way we choose to dress, not what brand or how much our apparel costs. Our wardrobe directly reflects to others important aspects about our personality. The colours we choose to wear can indirectly influence others\u0026rsquo; mood. The way we assort our clothes, what type of jackets or pants we choose to wear, and so forth, can tell a lot about how well organised or disorganised we are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are numerous types of clothes that we can wear for several different occasions. Whatever your taste may be, you will surely find something that suites you. Clothes come in a variety of different sizes, so everyone can find something regardless of their body type. It\u0026rsquo;s truly marvellous to think about how clothes evolved throughout the years. There are so many materials that clothes can be made from, all with their respective advantages and disadvantages. As an example, silk looks gorgeous and is fitting for ladies going to an important, elegant event, but it\u0026rsquo;s not too effective at keeping the body warm. Wool is effective against cold, especially in the winter season, but it tends to be itchy and doesn\u0026rsquo;t look aesthetically pleasing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe examples could go on forever, but the point still stands: clothes are indispensable for humans. You may not put too much effort into how you look or what type of clothes you wear, but you still wear them. They are just as important as water and food for us. But even with all of these said and done, I think the fashion industry sometimes exaggerates when promoting certain brands of clothing. As with all things, we need to find a perfect balance, one that isn\u0026rsquo;t either too extravagant or too poor. But, alas, it is all your choice. You choose what to wear and who to impress.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-032b7\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-032b7\u0022 data-guid=\u002249e60e15-d0c2-423f-ae41-a15c7c055ee7\u0022\u003eEssay about beauty\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about beauty este o lucrare care abordează un subiect vechi de când există umanitatea, frumusețea. Deși se spune că este subiectivă, Essay about beauty analizează frumusețea abordând-o din ambele perspective filosofice antice, estetica și etica, ambele având valori obiective, care pot fi bine definite, întelese și criticate. Eseul analizează caracteristicile care arată frumos pentru majoritatea lumii, cât și caracteristicile care sunt simțite ca fiind frumoase de majoritatea oamenilor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-m1dzo\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-m1dzo\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen talking about beauty, people usually refer to the physical aspect, the way a person looks. I think beauty is more complex than that and that we can find beauty in many places where we don\u0026rsquo;t usually expect to find it. I would describe beauty as grace and charm, something that captivates us and our imagination.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to physical aspects, beauty has a lot in common with symmetry. People with symmetric faces tend to be more attractive to others than those with slight deformations. Similar to this is the way we organize our stuff. Having a well-organized bookshelf, for instance, pleases the eye, as we see all the books fit perfectly, with similar shapes and sizes. On the other hand, putting a larger book along a smaller one doesn\u0026rsquo;t look too appealing. It might not necessarily be ugly, but you can\u0026rsquo;t say it looks beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat other things can we define as beautiful? Even invisible characteristics have a certain beauty to them. Being kind, compassionate, hardworking, loving, caring, generous and having similar other attributes can be considered beautiful. Making others feel good about themselves is beautiful. Helping others achieve their dreams is beautiful. Basically, being a decent human being can be considered beautiful. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t limit ourselves to only seeing outside beauty, but instead we should also focus on understanding the beauty of a person\u0026rsquo;s soul and personality. Too often we forget about these things and only see what lies at the surface and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a shame to not also admire the inner beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNature is one other thing that also possesses outer beauty and inner beauty. Admiring glorious landscapes, colourful flowers, trees and all sorts of natural elements is fascinating, but what\u0026rsquo;s even more captivating is how all these things affect the planet and us. Not only do trees look beautiful, but they also provide the oxygen that we so desperately need in order to live. Mountains and forests aren\u0026rsquo;t just natural wonders, they are also an escape from mundane life, they offer us fresh air, peace and quiet time to meditate. Rivers offer us the opportunity of swimming and they also provide water, with which we quench our thirst. All these aspects are beautiful, in my opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think beauty can be found anywhere and within anyone, regardless of physical aspect. One more important thing that\u0026rsquo;s worth noting is that physical beauty is subjective, as each individual has their own taste, but inner beauty is something that anyone can cherish and appreciate if given the opportunity to observe it. So let\u0026rsquo;s try to focus on inner beauty from now on. I\u0026rsquo;m not implying that physical beauty isn\u0026rsquo;t important, but I think that inner beauty deserves more recognition in our overly artificial society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-f77bv\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-f77bv\u0022 data-guid=\u002246c40934-8989-4af8-ba64-fcda5fd11f1a\u0022\u003eEssay about love\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat Is Love?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLove is a mystery. It can change one person completely. It also gives you a warm fuzzy feeling when you are around the person you love. What might seem to be just an irrational behavior is in fact possible to explain using science. What science has found are three causes: biological, chemical and evolutionary. I think that the biological and the evolutionary causes of love are the most important as they have been a vital force for humanity to survive, thrive and multiply through time. It might not seem that essential, but love actually serves an evolutionary purpose and shows its importance as far back as four million years ago.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the first place, the primary cause of love is when Homo sapiens began walking on two legs instead of wandering around on all fours about four million years ago in Africa. This changed a lot since it was the first time human beings saw each other´s full figure. Hence, sexual organs, eye colour, the chest region amongst other things were in full display and fully visible. This contributed to new ways of making love and both looks and personal attraction became a greater part of the equation. (Toufexis 2001) Therefore, the evolution of the human starts the modern way of loving one can say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, back in time it was necessary to partner up with a partner. Since a human being was quite vulnerable on its own with a baby in its hands, it was dangerous for them to even forage for food.\u0026nbsp; Thus it was critical to pair up with a mate to bring up youngsters. Romance served the evolutionary purpose of fulfilling males and females into long-term partnership, because it was important for nurturing infants as presented by Anastasia Toufexis in the article \u003ci\u003eThe Right Chemistry\u003c/i\u003e. Long-term relationships are a big part of love, which makes the ecological conditions a contributor to love as a survival instinct.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, in order for people to actually stay in love, one must have a baby every fourth year. This idea is called the four-year-itch, presented by anthropologist Helen Fisher. She says that primitive couples stayed together long enough to rear one child through infancy. Fisher also mentions that the \u0026ldquo;four-year-itch\u0026rdquo; shows up in modern societies. For instance, studies show that the divorce rate peaks around the fourth year of marriage in a handful of countries. Additional youngsters in the family then help keep pairs together. Theoretically, one kid adds four years to the current relationship. With that said the children that we make are a big part of love and in fact important to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo sum up: Love is in fact a strange thing. But in some way it makes sense I think. Scientifically there is evidence of the causes of love. Those are the \u0026ldquo;four-year-itch\u0026rdquo; and the essential to child rearing amongst other things. It has also shown its essential purpose for mankind\u0026rsquo;s survival ecologically. Therefore, I think love was originally served as an evolutionary cause, which then makes this generation exist. I believe that love is what really brings us together and will bring us together as individuals and as species and will let us live forever.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about fashion, beauty \u0026 love","MetaDescription":"Rochie sau fustă, jachetă sau sacou, moda ne privește pe majoritatea,fie că vrem sau nu, iar Essay about fashion este aici să ne clarifice situația.
