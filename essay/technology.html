A nu fi confundat cu un eseu despre caracteristicile internetului, Essay about the internet, advantages and disadvantages prezintă cazuri specifice în care internetul poate fi un aliat puternic în viața din secolul informației, precum și riscurile asociate acestei rețele globale. Essay about the internet, advantages and disadvantages este o lucrare redactată cu atenție și pe langă o notă bună la test sau examen, poate fi de ajutor pentru oamenii care abia încep sa descopere frumusetea transferului global de date.</p><h3 id="heading-jaoda" title="ID: heading-jaoda">Essay</h3><p>The internet is a wonderful and vast place where you can find all sorts of things that may interest you. You can delve into all the knowledge of the world, you can search for entertainment, you can buy mostly anything you want and you can communicate with other people, no matter the distance, almost free of charge.</p><p>By accessing the internet, you are travelling to a different world, one where everything is at your fingertips, a world where the answers to important questions lie just a few keystrokes away, a place where you can buy everything you desire and communicate with any human on the planet. It all sounds great, but nevertheless, it has its downsides.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the good first. I already mentioned earlier part of the things you can do online that are beneficial. There are several video platforms on the web that allow you to watch a variety of videos of your own choosing, be it educational, comical, action packed and all others. Unlike television, you are the master of what you want to watch. You don&rsquo;t have to wait for an episode from your favorite show to start, just search for them and you will find them.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to learn and gain new skills? No problem, for there are several sites out there that are tailored just for that. Do you want to buy stuff? Yet again, the internet will serve you well, with hundreds of sites which offer their own discounts and that have several other offers on hand. You can choose which one suits you. Want to communicate? Just access a social network or a program built specifically for communication, such as Skype.</p><p>However, be careful what you click on the web, for there are tons of hackers and scammers who want your personal information or your credit card number. Be careful not to infect your PC with a virus, as some viruses are hard to get rid of, while others may damage your operating system for good, thus necessitating a reinstall, which isn&rsquo;t convenient at all.</p><p>You will have to secure your system carefully before starting your navigation on the internet. You may never know when a network attack might occur or when someone might decide to take control out of your hands if you don&rsquo;t have the necessary firewall configurations correct. The advantage of social media, for instance, is that you can get famous really quick, but the disadvantage may be the loss of privacy.</p><p>As for the shopping sites, tread carefully, because not all of them are legitimate. Some of them are used by scammers in order to obtain financial information from you and then stealing your bank account.</p><p>All in all, just like everything in life, the internet has both advantages and disadvantages, but if you prepare yourself for the journey ahead of time, it&rsquo;s safe to say that no harm will come to you and that you have nothing to lose, but the world to gain.</p><p>Video games are the subject of much debate about whether they are good or bad. There is no definitive answer to this question, as they have both their advantages and disadvantages, but one thing is for certain: there are a lot of claims which highly exaggerate about the negative side of this subject.</p><p>You could say that I have experienced first-hand some of the negative effects of gaming. Indeed, what they say about addiction is true, especially if you are depressed or a loner. I used to spend about 5 or 6 hours a day locked inside my room, in front of my TV screen playing all sorts of games, as it was the only way that I knew how to have fun back then. You could say that I wasted my time doing this, as I could&rsquo;ve done other activities which involved interacting with other human beings, but in my personal opinion I don&rsquo;t think it was a total waste, simply because I have had fun playing them and I have seen a lot of stories in a way that can&rsquo;t be experienced through other mediums.</p><p>Speaking about interacting with other humans, you can also do that in multiplayer games. Sure, it might not be the same thing as talking to a person face to face, but I managed to gather quite a few online friends who I eventually met with in real life, and I can say that I&rsquo;ve formed a bond with these people that is more significant than the bonds I&rsquo;ve formed throughout the years with humans whom I&rsquo;ve met in reality. As you can tell, this has helped me socialize, even if I had extreme introverted tendencies, so there is no need to judge video games based solely on the negatives.</p><p>Another claim about gamers is that they are violent. I can testify that this is false, as I have grown up playing all sort of violent games and yet I turned out to be extremely calm. No other gamer that I know is a violent person. In fact, I would say it&rsquo;s quite the opposite, I think that, as a group, we are one of the most calmed collectives you could ever encounter in your lifetime. Sure, we might get angry at times when the loading takes forever, or when we&rsquo;re losing in an online match, but we never get violent, especially not in the outside world. I think this problem is more consistent with young kids who haven&rsquo;t been educated by their parents.</p><p>Also, speaking about violence, you can&rsquo;t say that all video games are violent. I don&rsquo;t know where some people get this idea, but it seems to be a popular opinion between older generations. Maybe it&rsquo;s simply caused by the misunderstanding from both sides of the coin. I think people shouldn&rsquo;t judge without trying something themselves, and you can&rsquo;t hurt anybody by playing a game, so there&rsquo;s no reason to not give them a shot. Maybe I am biased because I am a gamer myself, but hopefully I&rsquo;ve shed some light on the situation. After all, I am speaking from experience, not from something that I have read online. So go ahead and try playing a video game. You might have more fun than you think.</p><h2 id="heading-4cynz" title="ID: heading-4cynz" data-guid="9f9fac53-cbe9-4e0c-bf89-a0ff493d2ff7">Essay about video games advantages and disadvantages</h2><p>Essay about video games advantages and disadvantages, este o lucrare care abordează o temă pe care cu toții o cunoaștem, jocurile video.

We use them daily for a variety of different tasks and entertainment. Arguably, smartphones are starting to catch on to some of these everyday tasks, such as watching videos, reading and sending emails, playing casual games or going on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>But the computer is still unbeatable when it comes to more advanced tasks. Editing photos and videos, coding, managing files more efficiently or running several different programs for all sorts of other tasks that are simply not optimized for mobile devices.</p><p>The advantages of using a computer are numerous. If you are reading an essay on your computer screen, you could easily print it. Or, when you&rsquo;re writing an essay, you can avoid mistakes more easily by using the &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; and &ldquo;delete&rdquo; keys, rather than jotting out mistakes as you would on a regular paper. Let&rsquo;s not forget the fact that you can choose the size, font and style of the text, whereas on regular paper you are limited by your own handwriting, which is a pain for people who have bad handwriting skills. Also, typing on a real keyboard is way more accurate and time-saving than typing on a touchscreen.</p><p>Furthermore, if you want to edit photos professionally, forget the basic editor found on a smartphone and use something along the lines of Photoshop on a computer. While it&rsquo;s way harder and the learning curve can be steep, the results given by that program, if used right, are fantastic. Moreover, even navigating the web is much better optimized for computers than it is for other devices, so you&rsquo;ll have an easier time and usually more options when browsing your favorite websites.</p><p>My home computer has been serving me well since 2007 and it is still very usable today. Sure, not many newer video games work on it, but browsing the web and watching movies is still as fluent as ever. I can&rsquo;t say that about the last smartphone I owned, which just barely turned 2 years old recently. So this brings up the next advantage I wanted to note: reliability. While a top of the line phone might be outdated in a mere two or three years, a computer will serve you well at least 5 years if you build it with the right components. Thus, we have yet another advantage: hardware customization. You can buy components based on your own needs and you are not limited by the manufacturer, as you are with phones.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, that you want a computer just for browsing the web, doing your daily tasks and using the occasional photo editor here and there. Obviously, you aren&rsquo;t going to need an expensive video card for this, so you can save up a lot of money. And that is just one of a lot of possible examples.</p><p>In conclusion, computers are the most advantageous electronic devices a person can own and operate. Although smartphones and tablets are slowly catching on, nothing can beat a good old fashioned computer at the moment, and it seems it&rsquo;s going to be like that for at least a few more years.</p><h2 id="heading-3xj60" title="ID: heading-3xj60" data-guid="56b2bdd7-4f8f-4e4f-99ea-76a79c932227">Essay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet</h2><p>Essay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet este un eseu care descrie una dintre cele mai mari invenții ale umanității. Deși este o invenție relativ recentă, Essay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet ne arată cum de la ideea de a comunica pe distanțe lungi am ajuns la o lume virtuală plină de posibilități și oportunități, dar, ca orice lucru, și cu parțile sale mai puțin bune. Essay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet este o lucrare care ne descrie posibilitățile oferite de internet, riscurile care vin la pachet, precum și câteva sfaturi pentru a evita evenimente neplacute ce se pot întâmpla.</p><h3 id="heading-69gba" title="ID: heading-69gba">Essay</h3><p>The internet spans all around the globe, offering its users all the information available for humankind and tons of possibilities, such as watching movies and videos, listening to music, sharing files and communicating with each other through a different number of methods. As with anything, the web has its share of good and bad things, or advantages and disadvantages. There is plenty of stuff for both categories and they adhere to all the parts of the vast plane known simply as &ldquo;the internet&rdquo;.</p><p>For starters, there are several ISPs (Internet Service Providers), who all have different offers and tariffs, so having money to get connected shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, whatever your income may be. This is good, because you have a lot of choices that can accommodate your preferences. The downside can depend on where you live, though, because there still are quite a lot of areas where getting internet connectivity can be slow and painful.</p><p>But alas, once you are connected you will find a whole new world of possibilities and wonder. Be careful, though, because being prudent is the key to keeping your identity and information safe, for there are a number of dodgy websites and ways for hackers and scammers to make a fool of you. First and foremost, you will need to find an antivirus and firewall program in order to secure your connection. You will also need to keep them updated, because on the internet, new forms of viruses, malware and spyware are created each day by all sorts of suspicious individuals.</p><p>The good part is that you can find a lot of free alternatives that are just as good as the paid ones. Once you&rsquo;re secured you can make accounts on all sorts of websites that offer you plenty of goodies. The advantage of having internet above anything else is that you can easily replace other services in your home, such as television and phones. You can also pay for all your bills on the web, using all sorts of payment services, such as internet banking, PayPal and other money transfer utilities. Making new friends is yet another reason to have internet, especially if you&rsquo;re more of an introverted individual.</p><p>Do you want yet another reason to get internet? Knowledge! There is a ridiculous number of websites that offer you educational tools, both free and paid. If you want to learn the history of about anything you can imagine, you can access free sites like Wikipedia. If you want to become a professional in a certain field, you can always visit Lynda.com and similar sites in order to get you training done.&nbsp;</p><p>If that still doesn&rsquo;t make you consider getting internet, then what do you say about being up to date with the world&rsquo;s latest news? That&rsquo;s right, not just news from your local area, but from the entire globe can be accessed fast and easy. What is the downside to all of this? Just be prudent when navigating so you don&rsquo;t accidently let your essential information be stolen by shady individuals. Other than that, you are free to do as you may.</p><p>So go ahead, go surf the web and do whatever you like, because the possibilities are endless. Go learn, play, be entertained, be informed, get in touch with your friends from any part of the world. You can do it; the world is at your fingertips.</p><h2 id="heading-zbmdl" title="ID: heading-zbmdl" data-guid="f6902933-7b4c-4ba1-b6f5-0dc11a9a628c">Essay about digital technology&nbsp;</h2><p>Essay about digital technology a fost redactat de un scriitor pentru limba engleză, iar tu poți folosi acest eseu pentru a te inspira atunci când ai de redactat o temă de casă.

The 21<sup>st</sup> century has brought us immense technological advancements that have made life much easier and daily tasks much more convenient and easy to undertake. Tech isn&rsquo;t a new thing, but the digital industry is fairly young. Back in the 80s and 90s, technology was present, but it was mostly analog. What is the difference between digital and analog?</p><p>To put it as simple and plain as one can, let&rsquo;s look at cable television. Do you remember the classic tube televisions? Yes, the fat, heavy ones. Those only had the standard cable input and eventually some RCA outputs intended for VCRs. All those cables carried though them analog signal, much like cassette tapes. All it means is that they received or transmitted images and audio signals directly though the cable, without the need of decoding it by any processor or something similar.</p><p>Digital signal, on the other hand, is made out of binary code, meaning the ones and zeroes that the CPU in a computer processes. Digital offers higher quality and the potential to be modified or converted to certain file formats, but it does also require higher processing power. Try to fast-forward a VHS tape and then try to fast-forward a DVD or a Blu-ray disc and you will see a humongous difference. Not only is the fast forwarding process on digital clearer, but you can also skip to different parts of a file without the need to wait. Recording also goes way smoother.</p><p>The evolution from analog to digital didn&rsquo;t end with TVs. It also happened when it came to music players, as we have slowly but surely witnessed the transition from vinyl to cassettes to CDs and finally to fully digital, be it either by streaming or storing a file inside a hard drive. Although there are many audiophiles who argue that vinyl is still the best, even with all the technological advances, because it has a more &ldquo;organic&rdquo; feel to it, one cannot deny the convenience of digital, as it allows you to take your music wherever you go.</p><p>In any case, digitalization is inevitable. It seems that everything is becoming digital and getting connected to the internet: smart TVs, smartphones, printers, refrigerators, vehicles and even thermostats. Depending on your budget, you might find some of these digital gadgets to be unworthy of buying, but you have to admit that having them connected and communicating with each other makes life way more convenient.</p><p>Overall, I think that going full digital is beneficial to us in the sense that we no longer have to worry about small things. Some may say that this will make us lazy, but I believe that it&rsquo;s just a method of simplifying and already overly complicated life, where you have to move forward and get with the times. Want it or not, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to lead a normal life in today&rsquo;s world without using technology and being connected to the internet.</p><h2 id="heading-4l5m0" title="ID: heading-4l5m0" data-guid="5cfa2762-37ef-404f-bde5-82bbb26f23b4">Essay about video games</h2><p>Essay about video games îți prezintă felul în care scriitorul nostru a abordat tematica jocurilor pe calculator pentru a redacta un eseu interesant în limba engleză.

Dacă Essay about video games ți-a fost de folos, nu ezita să lași un review la acest produs.</p><h3 id="heading-77ybf" title="ID: heading-77ybf">Essay&nbsp;</h3><p>&ldquo;Reality is broken. Game designers can fix it.&rdquo;</p><p>Video games get a bad reputation from the media and uninformed people. Whenever a crime is committed and one of the criminal&rsquo;s hobbies simply happens to be gaming, you know immediately what is going to get the blame for his actions. Not the delinquent&rsquo;s mental health or motives, but video games take all the blame upon themselves. Why does the media always do this and why are parents so concerned?</p><p>Years ago, violent movies and songs were being attacked for the same reasons. Centuries ago, books and paintings were the victims of such unjust and over reactive opinions. People just can&rsquo;t cope with the fact that some humans are evil or have mental issues and instead prefer to search for scapegoats, even when there have been a few studies that found no link between video games and violence. Games are simply a more immersive form of media and that is all.</p><p>I remember playing Mortal Kombat and Doom since I was 5 or 6 years old. Me and other kids my age would gather at the arcade or at someone&rsquo;s house and play such games relentlessly, yet none of us ever turned into violent people. In fact, those games, along with action movies and some discussions with our parents, helped us understand that such scenes should only stay in the virtual world. Nevertheless, let&rsquo;s leave aside the issue regarding violence and how video games are seen by the uninformed and let&rsquo;s discuss about the benefits of playing them.</p><p>First of all, video games are a new medium for story telling that can offer interactivity and a variety of possible outcomes if done correctly. They tend to get more personal because you directly control the characters. My favourite franchise when it comes to linear or traditional story telling is Metal Gear Solid. Not only is the saga itself fascinating, but due to the interactive nature of games, you will stumble upon certain surprises that may blow your mind away, such as Master Miller telling you to go to sleep if you&rsquo;re playing the game at 3 AM. When it comes to interactive storytelling, there are several favourite franchises that come to mind: The Witcher, Deus Ex, Mass Effect and many more.</p><p>Secondly, video games stimulate the mind by putting up challenges that need great reflexes, logic, critical thought and hand-to-eye coordination in order to be completed. Sure, not all games rely heavily on critical thought, but those who do, do it fantastic. Last but not least, video games are fun. Simple as that, they&rsquo;re a fun hobby that greatly reduces stress and relaxes the user. So why not go and play a game right now? You just might be blown away about how complex this new digital medium is.&nbsp;</p><p>And don&rsquo;t be afraid to try out different genres than the ones that you&rsquo;re used to. Personally, I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of role-playing games until I got a hold of The Elder Scrolls. You never know what surprises may lurk in these realms.</p><h2 id="heading-3gqlx" title="ID: heading-3gqlx" data-guid="ee499429-e18a-4d31-b22a-e56d6b2dd62f"><span style="color:rgb(74,74,74);">Essay about online shopping</span></h2><p>Essay about online shopping este un exemplu de eseu în limba engleză de care te poți folosi pentru a scrie propriul tău text de nota 10. Nu uita să observi structura eseului despre cumpărăturile online în limba engleză, dar și vocabularul folosit de scriitorul nostru.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-whk2o" title="ID: heading-whk2o">Essay</h3><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Shopping is like a hobby to some people, if not all. While shopaholics are usually found in the female demographic, let&rsquo;s face it, we all love to buy stuff that we don&rsquo;t necessarily need from time to time. We are all guilty of it, especially during periods such as Black Friday, where we can find all sorts of cheap offers. We literally step on one another on such occasions.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">But what if you&rsquo;re the type of person who doesn&rsquo;t want to go out and get trampled on such events? What if you are only interested in the product&rsquo;s specifications (like a PC for instance) and don&rsquo;t necessarily want to see it in real life before you buy it. Well, that&rsquo;s where online shopping comes to save the day. Though not necessarily good for items such as clothes, which you&rsquo;re going to need to try on before buying, unless you know every of your measurements, buying stuff online can alleviate some of the pain of shopping in the real world.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">First and foremost, you have the entire shop&rsquo;s catalogue at your fingertips. Whether you just want to browse or look for something specific, you no longer need to search numerous aisles to get to what you want. You can also see if the item is in stock or not, or if the store has any similar products that may be differently priced. You can see all of the product&rsquo;s specifications in a simple spreadsheet, so you no longer have to squint at the tiny writing found in real stores.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Secondly, you have all sorts of different payment and delivery options at your disposal. You can usually choose between different courier companies that can deliver your product for different prices. Sometimes they even deliver your products free of charge if they price is higher than a certain amount. You can usually choose whether to pay by credit card, Paypal or other similar services and cash at the courier&rsquo;s arrival. Sure, you might be able to pay using either of these methods in the physical store, but it does feel more convenient to also have the item delivered to your doorstep when stores are usually crowded.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Last but not least, you can compare the same product on different websites at once, so you will know where to get the best price possible. In the real world, you cannot do this with just a few clicks, you would have to walk through the entire mall to be able to see every store&rsquo;s offer, or you might not encounter an enticing offer at all anywhere else but in the online medium.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to close this subject without looking at the negative aspects as well. As mentioned earlier in the text, while shopping for clothes, you might not get what you wanted because you have to know your exact measurements, and even then, you might not like how the product looks in real life compared to the photos on the website.</span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;">With all that said, you might want to give online shopping a try. Just be careful not to give your credit card information to any shady site that you might encounter. Go for popular and trusted websites that you know for certain people use.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3i9gf" title="ID: heading-3i9gf" data-guid="22e4c5ad-7094-43ee-8a90-b8084b46f5c6"><span style="color:windowtext;">Essay about the relationship between science and civilisation</span></h2><p><span style="color:windowtext;">Essay about the relationship between science and civilisation este un eseu care scoate în evidență legătura dintre știință și civilizație. Deși sunt două domenii ale căror legătură nu este întotdeauna evidentă, Essay about the relationship between science and civilisation ne arată o relație de interdependență între cele două, știința fiind un element cheie pentru comfort și educație, iar cultura fiind un element care împinge știința și dezvoltarea mai departe.</span></p><h3 id="heading-62ycg" title="ID: heading-62ycg"><span style="color:windowtext;">Essay</span></h3><p>Science and civilization are directly related to each other because of the fact that they both emphasize on progress and making the world better. First of all, we, as a civilization, need science in order to further advance from a technological standpoint. Technological achievements are, after all, tools that we can use to become even more civilized.</p><p>From a purely material perspective, nothing shows more signs of civilization than scientific wonder. Man lives in great comfort today, as he enjoys cinema, television, internet, video games and a wide variety of gadgets that help us and distract us from our problems, more or less. We have evolved past the times when we needed to meet face to face with someone in order to discuss simple things. We have evolved past the old days when simple diseases could be fatal. Science has been the main factor that has helped us reach our current level of civilization.</p><p>Secondly, we just need to look at third world countries, then look at our own and see how much of a difference there is on an economic scale. The economy is an entity which directly affects scientific research, development and sales. It is safe to assume that a country which lacks such advantages is not nearly as civilised as one which does have technological prowess. People from technologically impaired countries achieve basic tasks harder, while someone from a civilized society can do a lot with just a few button presses. This correlation shows just how much technology is related to civilization.</p><p>Furthermore, science has several different branches, one of which is medicine. A country&rsquo;s ability to treat its own people from diseases is yet another important sign of a civilized society. Sure, as we speak, we may not have cures for all of the existing diseases out there, but we have come a long way from where we were 100 years ago. This type of evolution can only occur in civilized places. There are regions on this earth that still don&rsquo;t have access to the things that we take for granted.</p><p>We often forget how much we have evolved in a short period of time. We take for granted a lot of the things that we have and others don&rsquo;t. We should feel delighted that we were born in a civilized state at this point in time. Sure, we don&rsquo;t have to be arrogant about the fact that others have it worse than us, but we can at least show appreciation to the people responsible for civilising our society.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that science and civilization are directly tied to progress. They are bound together and show signs of evolution within a certain community. If knowledge is power, then science and civilization are both symbols of this entity. There is nothing that can influence a person&rsquo;s mind-set more than technological wonder and the possibilities that they have.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay" title="Essay Examples" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay Examples</span></a><a href="/essay/travelling" title="Essay about travelling" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about travelling</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

A nu fi confundat cu un eseu despre caracteristicile internetului, Essay about the internet, advantages and disadvantages prezintă cazuri specifice în care internetul poate fi un aliat puternic în viața din secolul informației, precum și riscurile asociate acestei rețele globale. Essay about the internet, advantages and disadvantages este o lucrare redactată cu atenție și pe langă o notă bună la test sau examen, poate fi de ajutor pentru oamenii care abia încep sa descopere frumusetea transferului global de date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-jaoda\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-jaoda\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe internet is a wonderful and vast place where you can find all sorts of things that may interest you. You can delve into all the knowledge of the world, you can search for entertainment, you can buy mostly anything you want and you can communicate with other people, no matter the distance, almost free of charge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy accessing the internet, you are travelling to a different world, one where everything is at your fingertips, a world where the answers to important questions lie just a few keystrokes away, a place where you can buy everything you desire and communicate with any human on the planet. It all sounds great, but nevertheless, it has its downsides.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the good first. I already mentioned earlier part of the things you can do online that are beneficial. There are several video platforms on the web that allow you to watch a variety of videos of your own choosing, be it educational, comical, action packed and all others. Unlike television, you are the master of what you want to watch. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for an episode from your favorite show to start, just search for them and you will find them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you want to learn and gain new skills? No problem, for there are several sites out there that are tailored just for that. Do you want to buy stuff? Yet again, the internet will serve you well, with hundreds of sites which offer their own discounts and that have several other offers on hand. You can choose which one suits you. Want to communicate? Just access a social network or a program built specifically for communication, such as Skype.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, be careful what you click on the web, for there are tons of hackers and scammers who want your personal information or your credit card number. Be careful not to infect your PC with a virus, as some viruses are hard to get rid of, while others may damage your operating system for good, thus necessitating a reinstall, which isn\u0026rsquo;t convenient at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou will have to secure your system carefully before starting your navigation on the internet. You may never know when a network attack might occur or when someone might decide to take control out of your hands if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the necessary firewall configurations correct. The advantage of social media, for instance, is that you can get famous really quick, but the disadvantage may be the loss of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for the shopping sites, tread carefully, because not all of them are legitimate. Some of them are used by scammers in order to obtain financial information from you and then stealing your bank account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll in all, just like everything in life, the internet has both advantages and disadvantages, but if you prepare yourself for the journey ahead of time, it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that no harm will come to you and that you have nothing to lose, but the world to gain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVideo games are the subject of much debate about whether they are good or bad. There is no definitive answer to this question, as they have both their advantages and disadvantages, but one thing is for certain: there are a lot of claims which highly exaggerate about the negative side of this subject.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou could say that I have experienced first-hand some of the negative effects of gaming. Indeed, what they say about addiction is true, especially if you are depressed or a loner. I used to spend about 5 or 6 hours a day locked inside my room, in front of my TV screen playing all sorts of games, as it was the only way that I knew how to have fun back then. You could say that I wasted my time doing this, as I could\u0026rsquo;ve done other activities which involved interacting with other human beings, but in my personal opinion I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was a total waste, simply because I have had fun playing them and I have seen a lot of stories in a way that can\u0026rsquo;t be experienced through other mediums.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking about interacting with other humans, you can also do that in multiplayer games. Sure, it might not be the same thing as talking to a person face to face, but I managed to gather quite a few online friends who I eventually met with in real life, and I can say that I\u0026rsquo;ve formed a bond with these people that is more significant than the bonds I\u0026rsquo;ve formed throughout the years with humans whom I\u0026rsquo;ve met in reality. As you can tell, this has helped me socialize, even if I had extreme introverted tendencies, so there is no need to judge video games based solely on the negatives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother claim about gamers is that they are violent. I can testify that this is false, as I have grown up playing all sort of violent games and yet I turned out to be extremely calm. No other gamer that I know is a violent person. In fact, I would say it\u0026rsquo;s quite the opposite, I think that, as a group, we are one of the most calmed collectives you could ever encounter in your lifetime. Sure, we might get angry at times when the loading takes forever, or when we\u0026rsquo;re losing in an online match, but we never get violent, especially not in the outside world. I think this problem is more consistent with young kids who haven\u0026rsquo;t been educated by their parents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, speaking about violence, you can\u0026rsquo;t say that all video games are violent. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where some people get this idea, but it seems to be a popular opinion between older generations. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s simply caused by the misunderstanding from both sides of the coin. I think people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t judge without trying something themselves, and you can\u0026rsquo;t hurt anybody by playing a game, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not give them a shot. Maybe I am biased because I am a gamer myself, but hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ve shed some light on the situation. After all, I am speaking from experience, not from something that I have read online. So go ahead and try playing a video game. You might have more fun than you think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4cynz\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-4cynz\u0022 data-guid=\u00229f9fac53-cbe9-4e0c-bf89-a0ff493d2ff7\u0022\u003eEssay about video games advantages and disadvantages\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about video games advantages and disadvantages, este o lucrare care abordează o temă pe care cu toții o cunoaștem, jocurile video.

I think people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t judge without trying something themselves, and you can\u0026rsquo;t hurt anybody by playing a game, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not give them a shot. Maybe I am biased because I am a gamer myself, but hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ve shed some light on the situation. After all, I am speaking from experience, not from something that I have read online. So go ahead and try playing a video game. You might have more fun than you think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-d8b21\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-d8b21\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f4390ab2-c432-4a07-af40-f4da7b9749d5\u0022\u003eEssay about computers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDacă ești pasionat de tehnologie, dacă iți place să lucrezi în mediul digital sau pur și simplu dai din când în când un share pe acea rețea de socializare pe care o știm cu toții, Essay about computers este pentru tine.

We use them daily for a variety of different tasks and entertainment. Arguably, smartphones are starting to catch on to some of these everyday tasks, such as watching videos, reading and sending emails, playing casual games or going on social media.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the computer is still unbeatable when it comes to more advanced tasks. Editing photos and videos, coding, managing files more efficiently or running several different programs for all sorts of other tasks that are simply not optimized for mobile devices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe advantages of using a computer are numerous. If you are reading an essay on your computer screen, you could easily print it. Or, when you\u0026rsquo;re writing an essay, you can avoid mistakes more easily by using the \u0026ldquo;backspace\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;delete\u0026rdquo; keys, rather than jotting out mistakes as you would on a regular paper. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the fact that you can choose the size, font and style of the text, whereas on regular paper you are limited by your own handwriting, which is a pain for people who have bad handwriting skills. Also, typing on a real keyboard is way more accurate and time-saving than typing on a touchscreen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, if you want to edit photos professionally, forget the basic editor found on a smartphone and use something along the lines of Photoshop on a computer. While it\u0026rsquo;s way harder and the learning curve can be steep, the results given by that program, if used right, are fantastic. Moreover, even navigating the web is much better optimized for computers than it is for other devices, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have an easier time and usually more options when browsing your favorite websites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy home computer has been serving me well since 2007 and it is still very usable today. Sure, not many newer video games work on it, but browsing the web and watching movies is still as fluent as ever. I can\u0026rsquo;t say that about the last smartphone I owned, which just barely turned 2 years old recently. So this brings up the next advantage I wanted to note: reliability. While a top of the line phone might be outdated in a mere two or three years, a computer will serve you well at least 5 years if you build it with the right components. Thus, we have yet another advantage: hardware customization. You can buy components based on your own needs and you are not limited by the manufacturer, as you are with phones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s say, for example, that you want a computer just for browsing the web, doing your daily tasks and using the occasional photo editor here and there. Obviously, you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to need an expensive video card for this, so you can save up a lot of money. And that is just one of a lot of possible examples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, computers are the most advantageous electronic devices a person can own and operate. Although smartphones and tablets are slowly catching on, nothing can beat a good old fashioned computer at the moment, and it seems it\u0026rsquo;s going to be like that for at least a few more years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3xj60\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-3xj60\u0022 data-guid=\u002256b2bdd7-4f8f-4e4f-99ea-76a79c932227\u0022\u003eEssay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet este un eseu care descrie una dintre cele mai mari invenții ale umanității. Deși este o invenție relativ recentă, Essay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet ne arată cum de la ideea de a comunica pe distanțe lungi am ajuns la o lume virtuală plină de posibilități și oportunități, dar, ca orice lucru, și cu parțile sale mai puțin bune. Essay about the advantages and disadvantages of the internet este o lucrare care ne descrie posibilitățile oferite de internet, riscurile care vin la pachet, precum și câteva sfaturi pentru a evita evenimente neplacute ce se pot întâmpla.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-69gba\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-69gba\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe internet spans all around the globe, offering its users all the information available for humankind and tons of possibilities, such as watching movies and videos, listening to music, sharing files and communicating with each other through a different number of methods. As with anything, the web has its share of good and bad things, or advantages and disadvantages. There is plenty of stuff for both categories and they adhere to all the parts of the vast plane known simply as \u0026ldquo;the internet\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor starters, there are several ISPs (Internet Service Providers), who all have different offers and tariffs, so having money to get connected shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem, whatever your income may be. This is good, because you have a lot of choices that can accommodate your preferences. The downside can depend on where you live, though, because there still are quite a lot of areas where getting internet connectivity can be slow and painful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut alas, once you are connected you will find a whole new world of possibilities and wonder. Be careful, though, because being prudent is the key to keeping your identity and information safe, for there are a number of dodgy websites and ways for hackers and scammers to make a fool of you. First and foremost, you will need to find an antivirus and firewall program in order to secure your connection. You will also need to keep them updated, because on the internet, new forms of viruses, malware and spyware are created each day by all sorts of suspicious individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good part is that you can find a lot of free alternatives that are just as good as the paid ones. Once you\u0026rsquo;re secured you can make accounts on all sorts of websites that offer you plenty of goodies. The advantage of having internet above anything else is that you can easily replace other services in your home, such as television and phones. You can also pay for all your bills on the web, using all sorts of payment services, such as internet banking, PayPal and other money transfer utilities. Making new friends is yet another reason to have internet, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re more of an introverted individual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you want yet another reason to get internet? Knowledge! There is a ridiculous number of websites that offer you educational tools, both free and paid. If you want to learn the history of about anything you can imagine, you can access free sites like Wikipedia. If you want to become a professional in a certain field, you can always visit Lynda.com and similar sites in order to get you training done.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf that still doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you consider getting internet, then what do you say about being up to date with the world\u0026rsquo;s latest news? That\u0026rsquo;s right, not just news from your local area, but from the entire globe can be accessed fast and easy. What is the downside to all of this? Just be prudent when navigating so you don\u0026rsquo;t accidently let your essential information be stolen by shady individuals. Other than that, you are free to do as you may.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo go ahead, go surf the web and do whatever you like, because the possibilities are endless. Go learn, play, be entertained, be informed, get in touch with your friends from any part of the world. You can do it; the world is at your fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-zbmdl\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-zbmdl\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f6902933-7b4c-4ba1-b6f5-0dc11a9a628c\u0022\u003eEssay about digital technology\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about digital technology a fost redactat de un scriitor pentru limba engleză, iar tu poți folosi acest eseu pentru a te inspira atunci când ai de redactat o temă de casă.

The 21\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e century has brought us immense technological advancements that have made life much easier and daily tasks much more convenient and easy to undertake. Tech isn\u0026rsquo;t a new thing, but the digital industry is fairly young. Back in the 80s and 90s, technology was present, but it was mostly analog. What is the difference between digital and analog?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo put it as simple and plain as one can, let\u0026rsquo;s look at cable television. Do you remember the classic tube televisions? Yes, the fat, heavy ones. Those only had the standard cable input and eventually some RCA outputs intended for VCRs. All those cables carried though them analog signal, much like cassette tapes. All it means is that they received or transmitted images and audio signals directly though the cable, without the need of decoding it by any processor or something similar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDigital signal, on the other hand, is made out of binary code, meaning the ones and zeroes that the CPU in a computer processes. Digital offers higher quality and the potential to be modified or converted to certain file formats, but it does also require higher processing power. Try to fast-forward a VHS tape and then try to fast-forward a DVD or a Blu-ray disc and you will see a humongous difference. Not only is the fast forwarding process on digital clearer, but you can also skip to different parts of a file without the need to wait. Recording also goes way smoother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe evolution from analog to digital didn\u0026rsquo;t end with TVs. It also happened when it came to music players, as we have slowly but surely witnessed the transition from vinyl to cassettes to CDs and finally to fully digital, be it either by streaming or storing a file inside a hard drive. Although there are many audiophiles who argue that vinyl is still the best, even with all the technological advances, because it has a more \u0026ldquo;organic\u0026rdquo; feel to it, one cannot deny the convenience of digital, as it allows you to take your music wherever you go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn any case, digitalization is inevitable. It seems that everything is becoming digital and getting connected to the internet: smart TVs, smartphones, printers, refrigerators, vehicles and even thermostats. Depending on your budget, you might find some of these digital gadgets to be unworthy of buying, but you have to admit that having them connected and communicating with each other makes life way more convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, I think that going full digital is beneficial to us in the sense that we no longer have to worry about small things. Some may say that this will make us lazy, but I believe that it\u0026rsquo;s just a method of simplifying and already overly complicated life, where you have to move forward and get with the times. Want it or not, it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to lead a normal life in today\u0026rsquo;s world without using technology and being connected to the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4l5m0\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-4l5m0\u0022 data-guid=\u00225cfa2762-37ef-404f-bde5-82bbb26f23b4\u0022\u003eEssay about video games\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about video games îți prezintă felul în care scriitorul nostru a abordat tematica jocurilor pe calculator pentru a redacta un eseu interesant în limba engleză.

Game designers can fix it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVideo games get a bad reputation from the media and uninformed people. Whenever a crime is committed and one of the criminal\u0026rsquo;s hobbies simply happens to be gaming, you know immediately what is going to get the blame for his actions. Not the delinquent\u0026rsquo;s mental health or motives, but video games take all the blame upon themselves. Why does the media always do this and why are parents so concerned?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYears ago, violent movies and songs were being attacked for the same reasons. Centuries ago, books and paintings were the victims of such unjust and over reactive opinions. People just can\u0026rsquo;t cope with the fact that some humans are evil or have mental issues and instead prefer to search for scapegoats, even when there have been a few studies that found no link between video games and violence. Games are simply a more immersive form of media and that is all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI remember playing Mortal Kombat and Doom since I was 5 or 6 years old. Me and other kids my age would gather at the arcade or at someone\u0026rsquo;s house and play such games relentlessly, yet none of us ever turned into violent people. In fact, those games, along with action movies and some discussions with our parents, helped us understand that such scenes should only stay in the virtual world. Nevertheless, let\u0026rsquo;s leave aside the issue regarding violence and how video games are seen by the uninformed and let\u0026rsquo;s discuss about the benefits of playing them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, video games are a new medium for story telling that can offer interactivity and a variety of possible outcomes if done correctly. They tend to get more personal because you directly control the characters. My favourite franchise when it comes to linear or traditional story telling is Metal Gear Solid. Not only is the saga itself fascinating, but due to the interactive nature of games, you will stumble upon certain surprises that may blow your mind away, such as Master Miller telling you to go to sleep if you\u0026rsquo;re playing the game at 3 AM. When it comes to interactive storytelling, there are several favourite franchises that come to mind: The Witcher, Deus Ex, Mass Effect and many more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, video games stimulate the mind by putting up challenges that need great reflexes, logic, critical thought and hand-to-eye coordination in order to be completed. Sure, not all games rely heavily on critical thought, but those who do, do it fantastic. Last but not least, video games are fun. Simple as that, they\u0026rsquo;re a fun hobby that greatly reduces stress and relaxes the user. So why not go and play a game right now? You just might be blown away about how complex this new digital medium is.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to try out different genres than the ones that you\u0026rsquo;re used to. Personally, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too fond of role-playing games until I got a hold of The Elder Scrolls. You never know what surprises may lurk in these realms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3gqlx\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-3gqlx\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ee499429-e18a-4d31-b22a-e56d6b2dd62f\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(74,74,74);\u0022\u003eEssay about online shopping\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about online shopping este un exemplu de eseu în limba engleză de care te poți folosi pentru a scrie propriul tău text de nota 10.

While shopaholics are usually found in the female demographic, let\u0026rsquo;s face it, we all love to buy stuff that we don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need from time to time. We are all guilty of it, especially during periods such as Black Friday, where we can find all sorts of cheap offers. We literally step on one another on such occasions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eBut what if you\u0026rsquo;re the type of person who doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to go out and get trampled on such events? What if you are only interested in the product\u0026rsquo;s specifications (like a PC for instance) and don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily want to see it in real life before you buy it. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s where online shopping comes to save the day. Though not necessarily good for items such as clothes, which you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to try on before buying, unless you know every of your measurements, buying stuff online can alleviate some of the pain of shopping in the real world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eFirst and foremost, you have the entire shop\u0026rsquo;s catalogue at your fingertips. Whether you just want to browse or look for something specific, you no longer need to search numerous aisles to get to what you want. You can also see if the item is in stock or not, or if the store has any similar products that may be differently priced. You can see all of the product\u0026rsquo;s specifications in a simple spreadsheet, so you no longer have to squint at the tiny writing found in real stores.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eSecondly, you have all sorts of different payment and delivery options at your disposal. You can usually choose between different courier companies that can deliver your product for different prices. Sometimes they even deliver your products free of charge if they price is higher than a certain amount. You can usually choose whether to pay by credit card, Paypal or other similar services and cash at the courier\u0026rsquo;s arrival. Sure, you might be able to pay using either of these methods in the physical store, but it does feel more convenient to also have the item delivered to your doorstep when stores are usually crowded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eLast but not least, you can compare the same product on different websites at once, so you will know where to get the best price possible. In the real world, you cannot do this with just a few clicks, you would have to walk through the entire mall to be able to see every store\u0026rsquo;s offer, or you might not encounter an enticing offer at all anywhere else but in the online medium.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eIt wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be fair to close this subject without looking at the negative aspects as well. As mentioned earlier in the text, while shopping for clothes, you might not get what you wanted because you have to know your exact measurements, and even then, you might not like how the product looks in real life compared to the photos on the website.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eWith all that said, you might want to give online shopping a try.

Deși sunt două domenii ale căror legătură nu este întotdeauna evidentă, Essay about the relationship between science and civilisation ne arată o relație de interdependență între cele două, știința fiind un element cheie pentru comfort și educație, iar cultura fiind un element care împinge știința și dezvoltarea mai departe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-62ycg\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-62ycg\u0022\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:windowtext;\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eScience and civilization are directly related to each other because of the fact that they both emphasize on progress and making the world better. First of all, we, as a civilization, need science in order to further advance from a technological standpoint. Technological achievements are, after all, tools that we can use to become even more civilized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom a purely material perspective, nothing shows more signs of civilization than scientific wonder. Man lives in great comfort today, as he enjoys cinema, television, internet, video games and a wide variety of gadgets that help us and distract us from our problems, more or less. We have evolved past the times when we needed to meet face to face with someone in order to discuss simple things. We have evolved past the old days when simple diseases could be fatal. Science has been the main factor that has helped us reach our current level of civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, we just need to look at third world countries, then look at our own and see how much of a difference there is on an economic scale. The economy is an entity which directly affects scientific research, development and sales. It is safe to assume that a country which lacks such advantages is not nearly as civilised as one which does have technological prowess. People from technologically impaired countries achieve basic tasks harder, while someone from a civilized society can do a lot with just a few button presses. This correlation shows just how much technology is related to civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, science has several different branches, one of which is medicine. A country\u0026rsquo;s ability to treat its own people from diseases is yet another important sign of a civilized society. Sure, as we speak, we may not have cures for all of the existing diseases out there, but we have come a long way from where we were 100 years ago. This type of evolution can only occur in civilized places. There are regions on this earth that still don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the things that we take for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe often forget how much we have evolved in a short period of time. We take for granted a lot of the things that we have and others don\u0026rsquo;t. We should feel delighted that we were born in a civilized state at this point in time. Sure, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to be arrogant about the fact that others have it worse than us, but we can at least show appreciation to the people responsible for civilising our society.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe that science and civilization are directly tied to progress. They are bound together and show signs of evolution within a certain community. If knowledge is power, then science and civilization are both symbols of this entity.
