Ai stat vreodată cu un grup de rockeri? Ai observat vreodată un accent? Dacă da, Essay about culture ne spune că toate aceste exemple sunt diferite forme de culturi. De la evenimentele specifice unei regiuni sau religii, la un stil de muzică și îmbrăcăminte sau cuvinte specifice unei anumite regiuni, Essay about culture ne arată cum cultura este un aspect important în societate, ajutând la definirea identității individuale, regionale sau naționale.</p><h3 id="heading-ahdwb" title="ID: heading-ahdwb">Essay</h3><p>Culture represents shared values, beliefs, behaviours, and other similar things that make up the social life of a particular group of individuals. There are several types of cultures and subcultures out there, so if you travel a lot, you might want to investigate the practices of a certain culture before traveling to a foreign country.</p><p>Language itself can be considered a culture. It is a combination of verbal or even nonverbal symbols that help the members of a country or territory communicate with one another. In this sense, culture is a barrier between people. Some can&rsquo;t adapt to a foreign culture, even if they move out of the country. People usually interact differently in certain situations than the way they do in your region.</p><p>Traditions are also an example of cultural activities. You can tell apart almost any country by what holidays they celebrate and what customs they have during times of celebration or another sort of event. Just think about two separate countries, one which celebrates Christmas and one which celebrate Hanukah, then try to imagine other differences between them. Even from the start, we see differences between these two cultures without necessarily knowing an exact number of things about the latter.&nbsp;</p><p>We can assume based on this that the first country mostly Christian, while the latter is populated heavily by Hebrews. This also gives us an impression about other differences that stem from the first statement. We can get a better image about how people from these two separate countries dress, about the way they eat their food, about what they eat and how they act accordingly in a certain situation.</p><p>Lastly, there is also mundane culture, which can vary by quite a bit from country to country or even from region to region. Depending on your region, you may speak the same language as me but have a significantly different accent from mine. You might even pronounce words differently from time to time, and from this we might have difficulty communicating with each other. You might watch different shows from me depending on your age. You might not like the same songs that I like.</p><p>Artists can be a part of a certain artistic culture. As an example, there are painters from the renaissance, surrealists, pop-artists, musicians, which can stem into all sorts of subcultures, such as musical genres and their respective subgenres, fashion, design, jargon, gastronomy, and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Cultures are vastly different and they may not be compatible with one another, but we should respect all cultures, because people are different and our differences make us all special.</p><h2 id="heading-e58ca" title="ID: heading-e58ca" data-guid="54df7960-69c8-4d86-8953-f0bc95476121">Essay about music</h2><p>Essay about music este o lucrare care vizează muzica în viața de zi cu zi precum și mici detalii despre influențele muzicale de-a lungul anilor. Textul essay about music surprinde muzica, ca parte din viața de zi cu zi, și pune în discuție diferite genuri de muzică, caracterul matematic al procesului de creație, precum și conflicte de opinii apărute de-a lungul anilor.</p><h3 id="heading-aztex" title="ID: heading-aztex">Essay</h3><p>&ldquo;One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.&rdquo;</p><p>What is the one thing that many people, if not all, cannot imagine life without? Personally, I think that would be music. Be it different genres of rock, electronic, classical, experimental or others, it&rsquo;s clear that music covers a wide variety of tastes. Like any other form of art, music expresses feelings, thoughts and ideas to which we can relate or interpret.</p><p>Also, just like other art forms, you can use a variety of instruments and methods to create it. An artist can create a simple beat just by tapping his fingers on a wooden desk, for instance. But music isn&rsquo;t just about simple beats, it is complex, some people would even call it mathematical. Just look at all the different notes written on the portative of classical tunes and you can get an idea of how precise the process of creating these masterpieces is.</p><p>In the past years, there have been debates among music lovers that real music can only come from instruments and voices, not from synthesizers, but if you were to look at the music sheet of a song produced by computers, you would realize that there is mathematical precision in there. Yes, there is a whole other charm listening to organic music, but electronic music can also be quite complex and it has the advantage of managing to produce sounds which cannot be reproduces by standard instruments.</p><p>Even Jim Morrison, songwriter and vocalist for the famous band &ldquo;The Doors&rdquo;, once said that he could imagine in the future a man surrounded by tapes and machines, recording and playing the music that could once be produced only by an entire band. That thought alone, coming from an audiophile such as him, is a testament of the artistic values that electronic music holds.</p><p>Fortunately, different genres of electronic music are now starting to catch on and are being more and more accepted, not just by the general public, but also by dedicated music lovers alike. It has now moved way past the experimental stage and has become a staple of our society. Of course, like with all genres, there are quite a few horrible songs out there that have managed to stigmatize it. But let&rsquo;s not forget that even in the past, which so many people love to glorify, for every band such as AC/DC or Guns&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roses, there was a pole opposite &ldquo;artist&rdquo; such as Milli Vanilli or Nickelback.</p><p>Sure, everyone&rsquo;s taste is different, and that&rsquo;s ok. Maybe you like some of those bands that get so much disdain from other people. As stated earlier, the magic of music is that it can cover such a wide variety of tastes, emotions and ideas. While not all songs are as complex as Tool&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lateralus&rdquo; album, they can still hit that soft spot that makes people cling on.</p><p>In the end, like all art, not all music gets appreciated necessarily, but for the right people, it might be just what they need to escape reality, to dream about things they desire or simply to make them think about this marvelous world that we inhabit. Do yourself a favor and go to your favorite artist&rsquo;s concert as soon as you get the chance.</p><h2 id="heading-4a93l" title="ID: heading-4a93l" data-guid="ec774a34-fb11-4f1d-bf33-c6d76ad8f638">Essay about K-Pop</h2><p>Essay about K-pop, după cum îi spune și numele, descrie genul de muzică K-pop. Dacă nu ai auzit de acest gen de muzică, nu ai vrut să auzi, sau pur și simplu nu te-a interesat, Essay about K-pop te poate pune în temă în nefericitul caz în care primești această temă ca și exercitiu la test.</p><h3 id="heading-pknkj" title="ID: heading-pknkj">Essay</h3><p>K-pop is a relatively new player in the music industry. The abbreviation stands for &ldquo;Korean pop&rdquo;, as it has its origins in South Korea and displays a wide variety of audio-visual elements. The genre emerged in the early 90s with the earliest group to introduce this trend being &ldquo;Seo Taiji and Boys&rdquo;, with their technique being to implement foreign musical elements in Korean music and has since become the standard for the entire K-pop industry.</p><p>Most people in the western world have heard about this genre from PSY&rsquo;s now-famous hit song &ldquo;Gangnam style&rdquo; which became the first ever video on YouTube to have 1 billion views. As of November 2016, the video has garnered 2.7 billion views and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop there, as recently the video also became available in Germany, where you couldn&rsquo;t watch it before. Whether you hate it or like it, this song and its amusing video have made a tremendous impact that can&rsquo;t be denied.</p><p>Although the lyrics can&rsquo;t be understood by those who don&rsquo;t speak the language and the video may seem weird, the song is actually a parody of the extravagant and wasteful people who live in Seoul&rsquo;s richest district, Gangnam. The satire is directed toward the coldly formal looking people associated with this district, as it criticizes their lives of luxury and their inability to live life &ldquo;normally&rdquo;, like any other human who doesn&rsquo;t have a vast amount of money to waste.</p><p>Thinking about this song from this perspective is quite impressive. Who would&rsquo;ve thought that a video showcasing a man doing all sorts of ridiculous thing could actually be this deep in meaning? In actuality, the song did not become famous because of this, but because of the catchy beat and amusing video. It simply caters to the masses and is easy to remember. Not to mention that it has sprung several parodies on social media and video sharing platforms. A parody of a parody &ndash; now there&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t usually see.</p><p>But, of course, as with any musical genre, there are people who tend to be hardcore fans of this one. They are usually considered quite weird because of the way they dress and because of the way they idolize South Korea to an almost ridiculous extent. The best comparison that comes to mind is the Otaku group, a group that idolizes Japan and anime culture in a similar fashion. Even with such ridicule, I think that they should still be free to do as they please. A little music never hurt anybody.</p><p>Whether you like K-pop or not, the impact that Gangnam style had was tremendous and it has managed to propel this genre to all new heights. It has since garnered fans all around the world, some of them more dedicated than others. Even though I personally don&rsquo;t like the genre and the song too much, I can still appreciate the fact that it gathered billions of views on YouTube and made South Korea more popular than ever.</p><h2 id="heading-5tlfp" title="ID: heading-5tlfp" data-guid="e5c1666a-734b-408c-8d8d-3051b32e6f68">Essay about dancing</h2><p>Fie că preferi clasicul vals vienez, o confruntare de break-dance sau pur și simplu să te simți bine într-un club, Essay about dancing te poate ajuta. Existând atâtea stiluri de dans de-a lungul istoriei, Essay about dancing încearcă să prezinte câteva dintre stilurile mai populare de mișcare muzicală, scoțând în evidență câteva dintre caracteristicile generale, dar mai ales efortul necesar pentru această artă.</p><h3 id="heading-nokpo" title="ID: heading-nokpo">Essay&nbsp;</h3><p>&ldquo;And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.&rdquo;</p><p>Dancing is an art form. It expresses emotions through the means of movement. As with all arts, dance has its fair share of different styles and variations. If you&rsquo;re a teenager or young adult you were probably already acquainted with the style of dances in clubs. Of course, dancing has no exact rules when it comes to parties, but a skilled dancer will manage to captivate your eyes with their wit and capability of maintaining a certain rhythm with each beat of the melody in the background.</p><p>When it comes to pure art, what makes dancing unique is the fact that it depends on another form of art: music. Without music, dancing would be considered very weird and unexplainable, yet it is something that we cannot imagine the world without. Even in prehistoric times, different tribes and cultures had their own unique dances which they used to summon rain or try to communicate with an entity, but even then, music usually accompanied the ritual.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, dancing has seen a glorious evolution throughout human history. All sorts of different styles have grown from all kinds of different cultures and time periods. You can choose from a variety of classy styles such as a Viennese Waltz or Tango, or maybe you would like something a little more rhythmic such as Cha Cha or Salsa. Or maybe you&rsquo;re into the hard core scene and prefer to do a little Pogo or go into a full mosh pit. There are plenty of styles from which to choose and you will definitely find one that suites the music you like, the concerts and parties that you prefer and your movement skills.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t want to dance and would rather just be a spectator at a dance show. Yet again, there are several options here as well. Perhaps you might be interested in an enchanting ballet show performed to one of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s classics, such as Swan Lake or The Nutcracker. For the ones who prefer a vintage feel, a musical such as &ldquo;Singing in the rain&rdquo; might be better suited. If a more modern feel is your thing, then going to a breakdance show might just be what you&rsquo;re searching for.</p><p>In any case, there are lots and lots of variations to choose from, so go ahead and try out some of them. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find something that fits. And don&rsquo;t be shy about dancing in public, even if you are beginner, because everyone had to start somewhere. Don&rsquo;t just listen to music, feel it. Let off some steam during the weekend, after a hard work or school week.</p><h2 id="heading-llyum" title="ID: heading-llyum" data-guid="84b4de1e-499e-4616-bcd8-0734169151d8">Essay about the history of fairy tales</h2><p>Essay about the history of fairy tales este un material care îți prezintă evoluția basmelor din pespectiva istorică. Dacă vrei să aflii care este prima variantă a celebrului basm popular Cenușăreasa (Cinderalla) își recomandăm citirea acestui eseu.</p><h3 id="heading-2lpxr" title="ID: heading-2lpxr">Essay</h3><p>The most popular fairy tale is the one we know as Cinderella. Although we believe that this is the original, we must admit after looking in the history book that this is very far from the truth. We are going to realize that this exact fairy tale has been written in over 200 different versions and the oldest version goes back to around the birth of Christ. The ancient tale of &ldquo;Rhodopis&rdquo; is about an enslaved Greek girl who marries the king of Egypt and was recorded by the Greek historian Strabo.</p><p>A long time ago, fairy tales were oral entertainment told by story tellers. The stories were passed on through generations. However, since they were oral and not in writing, since the story tellers were artists and since different topics were important for each generation, the fairy tales had a little twist every time they were told. Some fairy tales started out as a true story about one man&rsquo;s life and developed into some kind of magical story. Others were dreams of either the storyteller or one his friends.</p><p>However, if you analyse fairy tales, you are often going to find out about the hidden explicit messages and violent messages in the text. Why would they contain this kind of material if they were meant to be told to a crowd of children? Well, the truth is that, in the old days, fairy tales were told to grownups. Actually, the concept of <i>child</i> as we know it today as an individual within the family framework is a very modern idea. This fact might help us to understand the evolution of fairy tales.</p><p>Until the 16th century, fairy tales in southern Europe were mostly crude and contained explicit language. But, during the 17th and 18th centuries we find them collected, written down, and modified. Some of the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect. The fairy tales were now more generally available than ever. They were often given a pedagogical slant and the adaption meant that they were now a lot more child-friendly.</p><p>Are those fairy tales that have not been adjusted to modern society still relevant for us today, though? The answer is yes. The reason why fairy tales have been passed on through generations and the reason why they are still applicable to us today is exactly the same. Even though most of us nowadays think that we are beyond nature and primal desire, that is not quite the truth. We are still drawn to the same things (the devil&rsquo;s work). We are still fighting for food, shelter, and love. Fairy tales comprehend those particular issues. Therefore, they are still very important and relevant to us - even in the year 2020.</p><h2 id="heading-ssyk3" title="ID: heading-ssyk3" data-guid="8b0eb828-c0a8-4baf-b8ea-98c73a948505">Essay about identity</h2><p>Essay about identity este o lucrare care vorbește despre ceea ce ne definește ca indivizi, identitatea. Fie că este vorba de identitate personală, identitate etnică, identitate națională sau pur și simplu identitatea într-un anumit grup, Essay about identity încearcă să acopere toate aceste aspecte, oferind o imagine generală a conceptului de identitate pe întelesul oricui.</p><h3 id="heading-94nix" title="ID: heading-94nix">Essay&nbsp;</h3><p>I stumbled upon an interesting riddle recently. It sounded something like this: what comes in over 7 billion flavours with no pair having the same exact taste? The answer was personal identity. What&rsquo;s interesting about identity is that it&rsquo;s complex, as it encompasses both changeable and unchangeable traits, regardless of outside or inner influence.</p><p>Of course, identity is not limited to just personal. An individual can similarly have a group identity, such as national identity or family identity as examples. Family identity contains all of the traits that a person has inherited from their family, including their role and physical elements that are common in their bloodline. Of course, their family identity doesn&rsquo;t define the person&rsquo;s own personal identity, as DNA is unique in all individuals, so no two people in a family are alike, not even twins.</p><p>National identity, on the other hand, is not necessarily related to a person&rsquo;s genes. It&rsquo;s more about the mind-set and experiences one has gained within the country in which they were born. A subdivision of national identity would be ethnic identity. Just because most people in a certain country are white, doesn&rsquo;t mean that a separate ethnic group is not to be considered part of the country. Minorities still retain a national identity, even if it comes with certain modifications due to their different experiences from the majority.</p><p>Nevertheless, the most important one out of all of these is personal identity. An alarming problem is that of identity theft, which is the process of using one&rsquo;s name, credit card number or personal identification number fraudulently. There have been many cases worldwide of people having their identities stolen, all with negative consequences for them. This is a huge problem, especially online, because people tend to be careless regarding their information. Hackers can steal your identity, create a fake profile, or buy something with your own credit card easily.</p><p>Another issue is identity crisis, and this problem faces mostly teenagers or young adults. Having an identity crisis is akin to being lost. You have no idea who you truly are, what goals you have and it can get pretty devastating at times. This can lead to problems in adulthood, as many who have suffered through this can feel uneasy and have low self-esteem, especially when comparing themselves with someone successful of their age. In case you encounter this problem, I believe that the best solution is to talk to as many people as possible, seek out advice from anywhere and anyone or even go to therapy if needed.</p><p>Our identity is ourselves. Just as we are, our identity is unique and can&rsquo;t be imitated by others, no matter how hard they try. Be yourself, no matter what others say, because you are a unique individual.</p><h2 id="heading-yn5uh" title="ID: heading-yn5uh">Essay about multiculturalism</h2><p>Is a multicultural society good for the world and for different countries? Does multiculturalism renewal different countries, or does it make their own basic national culture disappear? Should the government support multiculturalism? There are many different views around those questions. There are also many other questions about multiculturalism which are up in the light today. &nbsp;</p><p>Many people think that multiculturalism is helping countries because it gives them a bigger and varied culture. Just imagine our country without pizza, different varieties of burgers, Chinese food or tacos. In Great Britain we would not have salsa, reggae or other great music genres. Different sports like Ping-Pong or volleyball would not have been able to see the light, at least not as early as it did in the Great Britain without multiculturalism. If we looks at those examples many peoples would say that multiculturalism is helping us to renew different countries.</p><p>On the other hand; do we want our basic culture to renew too much? Is it not our culture that makes us proud of our country? If we take away the things that make us the people we are many people would think that the world will be too monotonous. We will just take the good things from different cultures and make them our own. Maybe our culture soon will be gone if we let it renew with no system at all?&nbsp;</p><p>Multiculturalism allows different peoples from different countries, religions and cultures to express themselves. Many peoples believe this is really good because we all should be proud of who and what we are. We are all unique in our special way, so why don&rsquo;t let the world see us as whom we really are? The society should not decide it. It is the difference in people who makes the beautiful diversity on our earth. It is a human right to be different.</p><p>But at the same time multiculturalism can make it difficult for some people. We hear a lot of immigrants complaining about the conditions in the country who they escaped to. Many of them have a dream of traveling back to their homeland.&nbsp; It might be difficult to settle down in a new country, and many immigrants are being bullied for their background. The feeling of being different is common by immigrants. They go to a school where almost everyone has a different sight on life than them. This is actually really difficult for some people.</p><p>We have many examples where immigrants can be really helpful for some countries. We have many examples of where people in one country help another. Just look at the British engineers who were involved in developing Japanese infrastructure after the Second World War. We also have the carpenters from Eastern Europe who works in Great Britain. Many immigrants come to a country for working. They have inspiration to work hard, because they want to make money for surviving. Rich peoples do not have this inspiration. They work hard because they might want a new and bigger car. The immigrant&rsquo;s works so good that it helps the country to improve. This is why some peoples say that multiculturalism is good for the economy.&nbsp;</p><p>In the news we often hear about the Muslim terrorists. This is a dark side of multiculturalism &ldquo;In the UK multiculturalism has been a subject of extensive discussion since the bombings in 2005. The British discuss free speech, security and terror and feel that their traditions and culture are threatened&rdquo; (p. 54 in Worldwide English). The statement shows that peoples in the UK feels threated about terrorists and since the majority of terrorists are Muslims they often gets the bad reputation. It makes it easy for people to think that it is only Muslims who are terrorists. This is not quite true, just look at the terror in Norway (Ut&oslash;ya) were a disturbed Norwegian was the man behind the terror, but as I mentioned earlier the majority of the terrorists are Muslims. In 2011 there were 95 terror-attacks and 52 of them took place in Iraq and all of them were made by Muslims. This is numbers who scares many people and it is really easy for people to think that it is only Muslims who are terrorists.&nbsp;</p><p>We have some political parties who say that most terrorists are Muslims, even though very few Muslims are terrorists. In some term they also say that &ldquo;almost every one of them is terrorists&rdquo; On the other hand, many of Europol statistics shows that Muslims stands for a very little part of the terror attacks, but if we looks at the whole picture we will see that Muslims stands behind a big amount of the terror in the world. But again many people would think that it would be wrong to say that every Muslim is a terrorist.</p><p>A result of multiculturalism is often unemployment. This is because the immigrants take the local peoples job. Many peoples think this is unfair because they mean that the local should be prioritized. At the same time many immigrants take the jobs that ethnic people do not want, so it is both positive and negative aspects.&nbsp;</p><p>In some schools they only have immigrants as students. They almost make their own &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo;. This is not good for the students. In this way they do not get integrated and the ethnic peoples will not be able to know the immigrants as well. The optimum would be to have ethnic and immigrants mixed together.</p><p>Multiculturalism is a phenomenon that I think will exist for ever. And I think that is good that we have it. I can see some of the bad things about multiculturalism, but in the big picture I believe that it is more advantages with multiculturalism than it is disadvantages. The freedom of being whom you want to be is really important and I think people can learn from other people, cultures or civilizations. I think that multiculturalism renewals countries in a good way and I don&rsquo;t think it is a huge danger for cultures to disappear. There are maybe more arguments were multiculturalism looks like a negative thing but the positive things about multiculturalism is much heavier and better, so it weights it over.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-mqy5u" title="ID: heading-mqy5u">Essay about culture shock</h2><p>Let me ask you a question, do you recognize that feeling you get when you&rsquo;re somewhere you don&rsquo;t belong? Somewhere people do things the other way around? Somewhere you feel like &lsquo;A fish out of water?&rsquo; well you&rsquo;ve been through the first stage of what&rsquo;s known as culture chock. Something we all should experience at least one time in our lives because it&rsquo;s good for us to expand our apprehension about the differences and similarities in others cultures.</p><p>Culture shock is good thing for us people to have in our society because it gives us a chance to intertwine and learn new things about others cultures that we didn&rsquo;t know before, for example other cultures values, assumptions. How their social structure is constructed, how greedy a culture can be, the equality between genders. What kind of religion they embrace. What language they speak and how their social interaction is between people. There is so much knowledge to gather about the world and culture shock is a part of the process of gathering that useful knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The disadvantages resulting from culture chock is that people will mix together and some individuals are not so fond of letting people in their society. They don&rsquo;t like it. The outcome of the mixture will lead to a multicultural society that some people don&rsquo;t like but it depends on which perspective you look from, to me it&rsquo;s not a disadvantage. I think it&rsquo;s welcoming and pleasant to see people with different cultures merge in one place but some would agree to disagree with me on this point.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that the cultural shock is something we should go through in order to be able to get an understanding of other people's behavior and personality. People get their identity from their culture and that unique identity that we all have affects other people when we react and respond in social interactions. Psychologist Dr. Geert Hofstede says that culture makes us behave in certain ways in our daily communications, every individual carries within himself a pattern on how to think, feel and act based on what culture<u> they derived from</u> and much of these patterns were learned to us during our childhood, because it&rsquo;s then a person is most susceptible to learn and assimilate.&nbsp;</p><p>In brief, I just want to say go out in the world, get to know another culture. Study abroad, move to a new country, visit an exotic place. Escape reality, experience something new you will have with you the rest of your life. You won&rsquo;t regret it.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/essay/health" title="Essay about health" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about health</span></a><a href="/essay/fashion-and-beauty" title="Essay about fashion, beauty &amp; love" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Essay about fashion and beauty</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

De la evenimentele specifice unei regiuni sau religii, la un stil de muzică și îmbrăcăminte sau cuvinte specifice unei anumite regiuni, Essay about culture ne arată cum cultura este un aspect important în societate, ajutând la definirea identității individuale, regionale sau naționale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-ahdwb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ahdwb\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCulture represents shared values, beliefs, behaviours, and other similar things that make up the social life of a particular group of individuals. There are several types of cultures and subcultures out there, so if you travel a lot, you might want to investigate the practices of a certain culture before traveling to a foreign country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLanguage itself can be considered a culture. It is a combination of verbal or even nonverbal symbols that help the members of a country or territory communicate with one another. In this sense, culture is a barrier between people. Some can\u0026rsquo;t adapt to a foreign culture, even if they move out of the country. People usually interact differently in certain situations than the way they do in your region.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditions are also an example of cultural activities. You can tell apart almost any country by what holidays they celebrate and what customs they have during times of celebration or another sort of event. Just think about two separate countries, one which celebrates Christmas and one which celebrate Hanukah, then try to imagine other differences between them. Even from the start, we see differences between these two cultures without necessarily knowing an exact number of things about the latter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can assume based on this that the first country mostly Christian, while the latter is populated heavily by Hebrews. This also gives us an impression about other differences that stem from the first statement. We can get a better image about how people from these two separate countries dress, about the way they eat their food, about what they eat and how they act accordingly in a certain situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, there is also mundane culture, which can vary by quite a bit from country to country or even from region to region. Depending on your region, you may speak the same language as me but have a significantly different accent from mine. You might even pronounce words differently from time to time, and from this we might have difficulty communicating with each other. You might watch different shows from me depending on your age. You might not like the same songs that I like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtists can be a part of a certain artistic culture. As an example, there are painters from the renaissance, surrealists, pop-artists, musicians, which can stem into all sorts of subcultures, such as musical genres and their respective subgenres, fashion, design, jargon, gastronomy, and the list goes on and on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCultures are vastly different and they may not be compatible with one another, but we should respect all cultures, because people are different and our differences make us all special.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-e58ca\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-e58ca\u0022 data-guid=\u002254df7960-69c8-4d86-8953-f0bc95476121\u0022\u003eEssay about music\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about music este o lucrare care vizează muzica în viața de zi cu zi precum și mici detalii despre influențele muzicale de-a lungul anilor. Textul essay about music surprinde muzica, ca parte din viața de zi cu zi, și pune în discuție diferite genuri de muzică, caracterul matematic al procesului de creație, precum și conflicte de opinii apărute de-a lungul anilor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-aztex\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-aztex\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the one thing that many people, if not all, cannot imagine life without? Personally, I think that would be music. Be it different genres of rock, electronic, classical, experimental or others, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that music covers a wide variety of tastes. Like any other form of art, music expresses feelings, thoughts and ideas to which we can relate or interpret.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, just like other art forms, you can use a variety of instruments and methods to create it. An artist can create a simple beat just by tapping his fingers on a wooden desk, for instance. But music isn\u0026rsquo;t just about simple beats, it is complex, some people would even call it mathematical. Just look at all the different notes written on the portative of classical tunes and you can get an idea of how precise the process of creating these masterpieces is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past years, there have been debates among music lovers that real music can only come from instruments and voices, not from synthesizers, but if you were to look at the music sheet of a song produced by computers, you would realize that there is mathematical precision in there. Yes, there is a whole other charm listening to organic music, but electronic music can also be quite complex and it has the advantage of managing to produce sounds which cannot be reproduces by standard instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven Jim Morrison, songwriter and vocalist for the famous band \u0026ldquo;The Doors\u0026rdquo;, once said that he could imagine in the future a man surrounded by tapes and machines, recording and playing the music that could once be produced only by an entire band. That thought alone, coming from an audiophile such as him, is a testament of the artistic values that electronic music holds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortunately, different genres of electronic music are now starting to catch on and are being more and more accepted, not just by the general public, but also by dedicated music lovers alike. It has now moved way past the experimental stage and has become a staple of our society. Of course, like with all genres, there are quite a few horrible songs out there that have managed to stigmatize it. But let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that even in the past, which so many people love to glorify, for every band such as AC/DC or Guns\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;Roses, there was a pole opposite \u0026ldquo;artist\u0026rdquo; such as Milli Vanilli or Nickelback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSure, everyone\u0026rsquo;s taste is different, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok. Maybe you like some of those bands that get so much disdain from other people. As stated earlier, the magic of music is that it can cover such a wide variety of tastes, emotions and ideas. While not all songs are as complex as Tool\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Lateralus\u0026rdquo; album, they can still hit that soft spot that makes people cling on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, like all art, not all music gets appreciated necessarily, but for the right people, it might be just what they need to escape reality, to dream about things they desire or simply to make them think about this marvelous world that we inhabit. Do yourself a favor and go to your favorite artist\u0026rsquo;s concert as soon as you get the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4a93l\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-4a93l\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ec774a34-fb11-4f1d-bf33-c6d76ad8f638\u0022\u003eEssay about K-Pop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about K-pop, după cum îi spune și numele, descrie genul de muzică K-pop. Dacă nu ai auzit de acest gen de muzică, nu ai vrut să auzi, sau pur și simplu nu te-a interesat, Essay about K-pop te poate pune în temă în nefericitul caz în care primești această temă ca și exercitiu la test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-pknkj\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-pknkj\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eK-pop is a relatively new player in the music industry. The abbreviation stands for \u0026ldquo;Korean pop\u0026rdquo;, as it has its origins in South Korea and displays a wide variety of audio-visual elements. The genre emerged in the early 90s with the earliest group to introduce this trend being \u0026ldquo;Seo Taiji and Boys\u0026rdquo;, with their technique being to implement foreign musical elements in Korean music and has since become the standard for the entire K-pop industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost people in the western world have heard about this genre from PSY\u0026rsquo;s now-famous hit song \u0026ldquo;Gangnam style\u0026rdquo; which became the first ever video on YouTube to have 1 billion views. As of November 2016, the video has garnered 2.7 billion views and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to stop there, as recently the video also became available in Germany, where you couldn\u0026rsquo;t watch it before. Whether you hate it or like it, this song and its amusing video have made a tremendous impact that can\u0026rsquo;t be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the lyrics can\u0026rsquo;t be understood by those who don\u0026rsquo;t speak the language and the video may seem weird, the song is actually a parody of the extravagant and wasteful people who live in Seoul\u0026rsquo;s richest district, Gangnam. The satire is directed toward the coldly formal looking people associated with this district, as it criticizes their lives of luxury and their inability to live life \u0026ldquo;normally\u0026rdquo;, like any other human who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a vast amount of money to waste.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThinking about this song from this perspective is quite impressive. Who would\u0026rsquo;ve thought that a video showcasing a man doing all sorts of ridiculous thing could actually be this deep in meaning? In actuality, the song did not become famous because of this, but because of the catchy beat and amusing video. It simply caters to the masses and is easy to remember. Not to mention that it has sprung several parodies on social media and video sharing platforms. A parody of a parody \u0026ndash; now there\u0026rsquo;s something you don\u0026rsquo;t usually see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, of course, as with any musical genre, there are people who tend to be hardcore fans of this one. They are usually considered quite weird because of the way they dress and because of the way they idolize South Korea to an almost ridiculous extent. The best comparison that comes to mind is the Otaku group, a group that idolizes Japan and anime culture in a similar fashion. Even with such ridicule, I think that they should still be free to do as they please. A little music never hurt anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you like K-pop or not, the impact that Gangnam style had was tremendous and it has managed to propel this genre to all new heights. It has since garnered fans all around the world, some of them more dedicated than others. Even though I personally don\u0026rsquo;t like the genre and the song too much, I can still appreciate the fact that it gathered billions of views on YouTube and made South Korea more popular than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5tlfp\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-5tlfp\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e5c1666a-734b-408c-8d8d-3051b32e6f68\u0022\u003eEssay about dancing\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFie că preferi clasicul vals vienez, o confruntare de break-dance sau pur și simplu să te simți bine într-un club, Essay about dancing te poate ajuta. Existând atâtea stiluri de dans de-a lungul istoriei, Essay about dancing încearcă să prezinte câteva dintre stilurile mai populare de mișcare muzicală, scoțând în evidență câteva dintre caracteristicile generale, dar mai ales efortul necesar pentru această artă.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-nokpo\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-nokpo\u0022\u003eEssay\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDancing is an art form. It expresses emotions through the means of movement. As with all arts, dance has its fair share of different styles and variations. If you\u0026rsquo;re a teenager or young adult you were probably already acquainted with the style of dances in clubs. Of course, dancing has no exact rules when it comes to parties, but a skilled dancer will manage to captivate your eyes with their wit and capability of maintaining a certain rhythm with each beat of the melody in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to pure art, what makes dancing unique is the fact that it depends on another form of art: music. Without music, dancing would be considered very weird and unexplainable, yet it is something that we cannot imagine the world without. Even in prehistoric times, different tribes and cultures had their own unique dances which they used to summon rain or try to communicate with an entity, but even then, music usually accompanied the ritual.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, dancing has seen a glorious evolution throughout human history. All sorts of different styles have grown from all kinds of different cultures and time periods. You can choose from a variety of classy styles such as a Viennese Waltz or Tango, or maybe you would like something a little more rhythmic such as Cha Cha or Salsa. Or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re into the hard core scene and prefer to do a little Pogo or go into a full mosh pit. There are plenty of styles from which to choose and you will definitely find one that suites the music you like, the concerts and parties that you prefer and your movement skills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s say you don\u0026rsquo;t want to dance and would rather just be a spectator at a dance show. Yet again, there are several options here as well. Perhaps you might be interested in an enchanting ballet show performed to one of Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s classics, such as Swan Lake or The Nutcracker. For the ones who prefer a vintage feel, a musical such as \u0026ldquo;Singing in the rain\u0026rdquo; might be better suited. If a more modern feel is your thing, then going to a breakdance show might just be what you\u0026rsquo;re searching for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn any case, there are lots and lots of variations to choose from, so go ahead and try out some of them. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll find something that fits. And don\u0026rsquo;t be shy about dancing in public, even if you are beginner, because everyone had to start somewhere. Don\u0026rsquo;t just listen to music, feel it. Let off some steam during the weekend, after a hard work or school week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-llyum\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-llyum\u0022 data-guid=\u002284b4de1e-499e-4616-bcd8-0734169151d8\u0022\u003eEssay about the history of fairy tales\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about the history of fairy tales este un material care îți prezintă evoluția basmelor din pespectiva istorică. Dacă vrei să aflii care este prima variantă a celebrului basm popular Cenușăreasa (Cinderalla) își recomandăm citirea acestui eseu.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-2lpxr\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-2lpxr\u0022\u003eEssay\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most popular fairy tale is the one we know as Cinderella. Although we believe that this is the original, we must admit after looking in the history book that this is very far from the truth. We are going to realize that this exact fairy tale has been written in over 200 different versions and the oldest version goes back to around the birth of Christ. The ancient tale of \u0026ldquo;Rhodopis\u0026rdquo; is about an enslaved Greek girl who marries the king of Egypt and was recorded by the Greek historian Strabo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA long time ago, fairy tales were oral entertainment told by story tellers. The stories were passed on through generations. However, since they were oral and not in writing, since the story tellers were artists and since different topics were important for each generation, the fairy tales had a little twist every time they were told. Some fairy tales started out as a true story about one man\u0026rsquo;s life and developed into some kind of magical story. Others were dreams of either the storyteller or one his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you analyse fairy tales, you are often going to find out about the hidden explicit messages and violent messages in the text. Why would they contain this kind of material if they were meant to be told to a crowd of children? Well, the truth is that, in the old days, fairy tales were told to grownups. Actually, the concept of \u003ci\u003echild\u003c/i\u003e as we know it today as an individual within the family framework is a very modern idea. This fact might help us to understand the evolution of fairy tales.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUntil the 16th century, fairy tales in southern Europe were mostly crude and contained explicit language. But, during the 17th and 18th centuries we find them collected, written down, and modified. Some of the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect. The fairy tales were now more generally available than ever. They were often given a pedagogical slant and the adaption meant that they were now a lot more child-friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre those fairy tales that have not been adjusted to modern society still relevant for us today, though? The answer is yes. The reason why fairy tales have been passed on through generations and the reason why they are still applicable to us today is exactly the same. Even though most of us nowadays think that we are beyond nature and primal desire, that is not quite the truth. We are still drawn to the same things (the devil\u0026rsquo;s work). We are still fighting for food, shelter, and love. Fairy tales comprehend those particular issues. Therefore, they are still very important and relevant to us - even in the year 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ssyk3\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ssyk3\u0022 data-guid=\u00228b0eb828-c0a8-4baf-b8ea-98c73a948505\u0022\u003eEssay about identity\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssay about identity este o lucrare care vorbește despre ceea ce ne definește ca indivizi, identitatea. Fie că este vorba de identitate personală, identitate etnică, identitate națională sau pur și simplu identitatea într-un anumit grup, Essay about identity încearcă să acopere toate aceste aspecte, oferind o imagine generală a conceptului de identitate pe întelesul oricui.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-94nix\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-94nix\u0022\u003eEssay\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI stumbled upon an interesting riddle recently. It sounded something like this: what comes in over 7 billion flavours with no pair having the same exact taste? The answer was personal identity. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting about identity is that it\u0026rsquo;s complex, as it encompasses both changeable and unchangeable traits, regardless of outside or inner influence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, identity is not limited to just personal. An individual can similarly have a group identity, such as national identity or family identity as examples. Family identity contains all of the traits that a person has inherited from their family, including their role and physical elements that are common in their bloodline. Of course, their family identity doesn\u0026rsquo;t define the person\u0026rsquo;s own personal identity, as DNA is unique in all individuals, so no two people in a family are alike, not even twins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNational identity, on the other hand, is not necessarily related to a person\u0026rsquo;s genes. It\u0026rsquo;s more about the mind-set and experiences one has gained within the country in which they were born. A subdivision of national identity would be ethnic identity. Just because most people in a certain country are white, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that a separate ethnic group is not to be considered part of the country. Minorities still retain a national identity, even if it comes with certain modifications due to their different experiences from the majority.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, the most important one out of all of these is personal identity. An alarming problem is that of identity theft, which is the process of using one\u0026rsquo;s name, credit card number or personal identification number fraudulently. There have been many cases worldwide of people having their identities stolen, all with negative consequences for them. This is a huge problem, especially online, because people tend to be careless regarding their information. Hackers can steal your identity, create a fake profile, or buy something with your own credit card easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother issue is identity crisis, and this problem faces mostly teenagers or young adults. Having an identity crisis is akin to being lost. You have no idea who you truly are, what goals you have and it can get pretty devastating at times. This can lead to problems in adulthood, as many who have suffered through this can feel uneasy and have low self-esteem, especially when comparing themselves with someone successful of their age. In case you encounter this problem, I believe that the best solution is to talk to as many people as possible, seek out advice from anywhere and anyone or even go to therapy if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur identity is ourselves. Just as we are, our identity is unique and can\u0026rsquo;t be imitated by others, no matter how hard they try. Be yourself, no matter what others say, because you are a unique individual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-yn5uh\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-yn5uh\u0022\u003eEssay about multiculturalism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs a multicultural society good for the world and for different countries? Does multiculturalism renewal different countries, or does it make their own basic national culture disappear? Should the government support multiculturalism? There are many different views around those questions. There are also many other questions about multiculturalism which are up in the light today. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people think that multiculturalism is helping countries because it gives them a bigger and varied culture. Just imagine our country without pizza, different varieties of burgers, Chinese food or tacos. In Great Britain we would not have salsa, reggae or other great music genres. Different sports like Ping-Pong or volleyball would not have been able to see the light, at least not as early as it did in the Great Britain without multiculturalism. If we looks at those examples many peoples would say that multiculturalism is helping us to renew different countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand; do we want our basic culture to renew too much? Is it not our culture that makes us proud of our country? If we take away the things that make us the people we are many people would think that the world will be too monotonous. We will just take the good things from different cultures and make them our own. Maybe our culture soon will be gone if we let it renew with no system at all?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMulticulturalism allows different peoples from different countries, religions and cultures to express themselves. Many peoples believe this is really good because we all should be proud of who and what we are. We are all unique in our special way, so why don\u0026rsquo;t let the world see us as whom we really are? The society should not decide it. It is the difference in people who makes the beautiful diversity on our earth. It is a human right to be different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut at the same time multiculturalism can make it difficult for some people. We hear a lot of immigrants complaining about the conditions in the country who they escaped to. Many of them have a dream of traveling back to their homeland.\u0026nbsp; It might be difficult to settle down in a new country, and many immigrants are being bullied for their background. The feeling of being different is common by immigrants. They go to a school where almost everyone has a different sight on life than them. This is actually really difficult for some people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have many examples where immigrants can be really helpful for some countries. We have many examples of where people in one country help another. Just look at the British engineers who were involved in developing Japanese infrastructure after the Second World War. We also have the carpenters from Eastern Europe who works in Great Britain. Many immigrants come to a country for working. They have inspiration to work hard, because they want to make money for surviving. Rich peoples do not have this inspiration. They work hard because they might want a new and bigger car. The immigrant\u0026rsquo;s works so good that it helps the country to improve. This is why some peoples say that multiculturalism is good for the economy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the news we often hear about the Muslim terrorists. This is a dark side of multiculturalism \u0026ldquo;In the UK multiculturalism has been a subject of extensive discussion since the bombings in 2005. The British discuss free speech, security and terror and feel that their traditions and culture are threatened\u0026rdquo; (p. 54 in Worldwide English). The statement shows that peoples in the UK feels threated about terrorists and since the majority of terrorists are Muslims they often gets the bad reputation. It makes it easy for people to think that it is only Muslims who are terrorists. This is not quite true, just look at the terror in Norway (Ut\u0026oslash;ya) were a disturbed Norwegian was the man behind the terror, but as I mentioned earlier the majority of the terrorists are Muslims. In 2011 there were 95 terror-attacks and 52 of them took place in Iraq and all of them were made by Muslims. This is numbers who scares many people and it is really easy for people to think that it is only Muslims who are terrorists.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have some political parties who say that most terrorists are Muslims, even though very few Muslims are terrorists. In some term they also say that \u0026ldquo;almost every one of them is terrorists\u0026rdquo; On the other hand, many of Europol statistics shows that Muslims stands for a very little part of the terror attacks, but if we looks at the whole picture we will see that Muslims stands behind a big amount of the terror in the world. But again many people would think that it would be wrong to say that every Muslim is a terrorist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA result of multiculturalism is often unemployment. This is because the immigrants take the local peoples job. Many peoples think this is unfair because they mean that the local should be prioritized. At the same time many immigrants take the jobs that ethnic people do not want, so it is both positive and negative aspects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some schools they only have immigrants as students. They almost make their own \u0026ldquo;ghetto\u0026rdquo;. This is not good for the students. In this way they do not get integrated and the ethnic peoples will not be able to know the immigrants as well. The optimum would be to have ethnic and immigrants mixed together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMulticulturalism is a phenomenon that I think will exist for ever. And I think that is good that we have it. I can see some of the bad things about multiculturalism, but in the big picture I believe that it is more advantages with multiculturalism than it is disadvantages. The freedom of being whom you want to be is really important and I think people can learn from other people, cultures or civilizations. I think that multiculturalism renewals countries in a good way and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is a huge danger for cultures to disappear. There are maybe more arguments were multiculturalism looks like a negative thing but the positive things about multiculturalism is much heavier and better, so it weights it over.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-mqy5u\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-mqy5u\u0022\u003eEssay about culture shock\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet me ask you a question, do you recognize that feeling you get when you\u0026rsquo;re somewhere you don\u0026rsquo;t belong? Somewhere people do things the other way around? Somewhere you feel like \u0026lsquo;A fish out of water?\u0026rsquo; well you\u0026rsquo;ve been through the first stage of what\u0026rsquo;s known as culture chock. Something we all should experience at least one time in our lives because it\u0026rsquo;s good for us to expand our apprehension about the differences and similarities in others cultures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCulture shock is good thing for us people to have in our society because it gives us a chance to intertwine and learn new things about others cultures that we didn\u0026rsquo;t know before, for example other cultures values, assumptions. How their social structure is constructed, how greedy a culture can be, the equality between genders. What kind of religion they embrace. What language they speak and how their social interaction is between people. There is so much knowledge to gather about the world and culture shock is a part of the process of gathering that useful knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe disadvantages resulting from culture chock is that people will mix together and some individuals are not so fond of letting people in their society. They don\u0026rsquo;t like it. The outcome of the mixture will lead to a multicultural society that some people don\u0026rsquo;t like but it depends on which perspective you look from, to me it\u0026rsquo;s not a disadvantage. I think it\u0026rsquo;s welcoming and pleasant to see people with different cultures merge in one place but some would agree to disagree with me on this point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that the cultural shock is something we should go through in order to be able to get an understanding of other people\u0027s behavior and personality. People get their identity from their culture and that unique identity that we all have affects other people when we react and respond in social interactions. Psychologist Dr. Geert Hofstede says that culture makes us behave in certain ways in our daily communications, every individual carries within himself a pattern on how to think, feel and act based on what culture\u003cu\u003e they derived from\u003c/u\u003e and much of these patterns were learned to us during our childhood, because it\u0026rsquo;s then a person is most susceptible to learn and assimilate.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn brief, I just want to say go out in the world, get to know another culture. Study abroad, move to a new country, visit an exotic place. Escape reality, experience something new you will have with you the rest of your life. You won\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Essay about culture, identity and music","MetaDescription":"Ai sărbătorit vreodată anul nou?
