He is created by Frankenstein out of parts of dead bodies: &ldquo;I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. [&hellip;] The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials.&rdquo; (p. 55)</p><p>Frankenstein describes the creature&rsquo;s appearance in detail. The creature&rsquo;s frightening physical form is the source of much of the story&rsquo;s horror. Moreover, the <strong>creature&rsquo;s appearance is important because it stops him from integrating into society</strong>. Although he wants to make friends and to help the poor people he has been watching, they judge him on his appearance and attack him.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankenstein explains that he makes the creature &ldquo;about <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>About 2,44 metres tall - a giant.</p>">eight feet in height</span>&rdquo; (p. 54) because the small &ldquo;fibers, muscles, and veins&rdquo; (p. 54) are difficult to work with. Although he intends the creature to be beautiful, the result is the opposite:</p><blockquote><p>His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! &ndash; Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>A face full of wrinkles.</p>">shrivelled complexion</span> and straight black lips.&nbsp;(p. 58)</p></blockquote><p>When Frankenstein comes across the creature again in the mountains, he claims that &ldquo;its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes&rdquo; (p. 102).</p><h2 id="heading-dvwct" data-guid="f7c196fc-31e4-4ef7-8635-7a8f126d6752"><strong>Inner characterization</strong></h2><p>The creature is characterized both through Frankenstein&rsquo;s descriptions and through the creature&rsquo;s own narrative of his experiences, which appears in Volume Two, chapters three to eight. Readers&rsquo; <strong>first impressions of the creature suggest that he is an unfeeling monster</strong>. This is because readers and Frankenstein are blinded by the creature&rsquo;s physical ugliness. The impression is backed up by the creature&rsquo;s murder of Frankenstein&rsquo;s young brother.</p><h3 id="heading-91bm9"><strong>The creature becomes evil&nbsp;because he is rejected by everyone</strong></h3><p>The creature&rsquo;s own words quickly suggest that he isn&rsquo;t just the unfeeling monster we think to begin with. He has many <strong>human feelings</strong> and is able to be good. When the creature meets Frankenstein on the mountain, he claims that although he <strong>started out good, his experiences have made him cruel</strong>: &ldquo; &lsquo;I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 103)</p><p>The creature repeatedly explains that he is <strong>miserable</strong> &ndash; and that this makes him act wrongly. He is particularly unhappy that Frankenstein has rejected him after bringing him into the world: &ldquo; &lsquo;You, my creator, <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>To hate or feel disgusted by.</p>">abhor</span> me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 103)</p><p>The creature explains his initial <strong>confusion</strong> on being brought into the world: &ldquo; &lsquo;It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 105). Almost like a child, he learns to understand his senses, and begins to process his emotions. The creature becomes invested in the family in the cottage near where he lives and wishes to reveal himself to them:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Actions and personality.</p>">demeanour</span> and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.&rsquo;&nbsp;(pp. 117-118)</p></blockquote><p>The creature&rsquo;s <strong>hope and</strong> <strong>wish for affection motivate him to learn to speak</strong> and to read, and he begins to secretly help the family with their daily tasks.</p><p>However, when he is rejected even by the family he has helped, he curses his creator, Frankenstein, and blames him for his unhappiness: &ldquo; &lsquo;Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even <i>you</i> turned from me in disgust?&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 133). This part of the creature&rsquo;s tale is likely to increase readers&rsquo; <strong>sympathy</strong> for him.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-8rc5y"><strong>The creature is alone and longs for a partner</strong></h3><p>Like his creator, the creature is characterized by his aloneness. But unlike Frankenstein, <strong>he does not choose to be alone</strong> &ndash; he wants to be part of society. Consequently, he asks Frankenstein to make him a companion, <strong>claiming that he has a right to be happy</strong> &ndash; and that Frankenstein is morally obliged to help him:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>The creature is basically saying that he, like anyone else, needs love and affection from another being. If he had a partner, they could touch and comfort each other.</p>">the interchange of those sympathies</span> necessary for my being. This you alone can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.&rsquo;&nbsp;(p. 147)</p></blockquote><p>Initially, he makes rational arguments, trying to persuade Frankenstein to do as he asks: &ldquo; &lsquo;instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 147). However, despite saying he won&rsquo;t threaten Frankenstein, he quickly claims he will seek revenge if Frankenstein doesn&rsquo;t make him a companion (p. 148).&nbsp;</p><p>Like Frankenstein, the creature is <strong>ruled by a mixture of reason and passion</strong>, which sometimes compete with each other: &ldquo;A <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Devil-like or evil.</p>">fiendish</span> rage animated him as he said this; [&hellip;] but presently he calmed himself as proceeded. &lsquo;I intended to reason. This passion is <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Harmful.</p>">detrimental</span> to me [&hellip;].&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 148)&nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-pmhlv"><strong>Our sympathy with the creature changes several times</strong></h3><p>While we may at first think the creature is an evil monster, our sympathy for him increases when we realize that he has thoughts and feelings like humans. However, things change again when Frankenstein tears apart the companion for the creature which he has been working on. From that point on, the creature seeks <strong>revenge</strong> on Frankenstein. He then goes on to brutally murder Frankenstein&rsquo;s friend Clerval and his fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth. At this point the creature appears cruel and becomes <strong>less sympathetic</strong>.</p><p>Our sympathy increases once again at the end of the novel, when the creature comes aboard Walton&rsquo;s ship to mourn over Frankenstein&rsquo;s dead body. Frankenstein&rsquo;s death leaves the creature entirely alone, and he claims that he felt pity towards Frankenstein and horror towards himself even while committing his crimes (p. 222). When Walton accuses him of failing to listen to his conscience, the creature replies:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? [&hellip;] He suffered not in <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>When he did it.</p>">the consummation of the deed </span>&ndash; oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering details of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.&rsquo;&nbsp;(p. 222)</p></blockquote><p>The creature reveals that he was <strong>aware that his actions were wrong</strong> and regretted them, but was unable to stop himself from acting on his passions. In this way, he proves that his feelings are as complex as those of a human being.</p><h3 id="heading-s3t0x"><strong>He appears to commit suicide in the ending</strong></h3><p>Hating himself, the creature claims he will kill himself by burning himself somewhere far away in the Arctic. He will do this so that no one will be able to learn how he was created and make another creature. He will &ldquo; &lsquo;consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I have been.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 224)</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/frankenstein/characters/victor-frankenstein" title="Victor Frankenstein" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Victor Frankenstein</span></a></div></div></div></div>

He is created by Frankenstein out of parts of dead bodies: \u0026ldquo;I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. [\u0026hellip;] The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials.\u0026rdquo; (p. 55)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrankenstein describes the creature\u0026rsquo;s appearance in detail. The creature\u0026rsquo;s frightening physical form is the source of much of the story\u0026rsquo;s horror. Moreover, the \u003cstrong\u003ecreature\u0026rsquo;s appearance is important because it stops him from integrating into society\u003c/strong\u003e. Although he wants to make friends and to help the poor people he has been watching, they judge him on his appearance and attack him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrankenstein explains that he makes the creature \u0026ldquo;about \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eAbout 2,44 metres tall - a giant.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003eeight feet in height\u003c/span\u003e\u0026rdquo; (p. 54) because the small \u0026ldquo;fibers, muscles, and veins\u0026rdquo; (p. 54) are difficult to work with. Although he intends the creature to be beautiful, the result is the opposite:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! \u0026ndash; Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eA face full of wrinkles.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003eshrivelled complexion\u003c/span\u003e and straight black lips.\u0026nbsp;(p. 58)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Frankenstein comes across the creature again in the mountains, he claims that \u0026ldquo;its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes\u0026rdquo; (p. 102).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-dvwct\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f7c196fc-31e4-4ef7-8635-7a8f126d6752\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInner characterization\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creature is characterized both through Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s descriptions and through the creature\u0026rsquo;s own narrative of his experiences, which appears in Volume Two, chapters three to eight. Readers\u0026rsquo; \u003cstrong\u003efirst impressions of the creature suggest that he is an unfeeling monster\u003c/strong\u003e. This is because readers and Frankenstein are blinded by the creature\u0026rsquo;s physical ugliness. The impression is backed up by the creature\u0026rsquo;s murder of Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s young brother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-91bm9\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe creature becomes evil\u0026nbsp;because he is rejected by everyone\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creature\u0026rsquo;s own words quickly suggest that he isn\u0026rsquo;t just the unfeeling monster we think to begin with. He has many \u003cstrong\u003ehuman feelings\u003c/strong\u003e and is able to be good. When the creature meets Frankenstein on the mountain, he claims that although he \u003cstrong\u003estarted out good, his experiences have made him cruel\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 103)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creature repeatedly explains that he is \u003cstrong\u003emiserable\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; and that this makes him act wrongly. He is particularly unhappy that Frankenstein has rejected him after bringing him into the world: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;You, my creator, \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eTo hate or feel disgusted by.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003eabhor\u003c/span\u003e me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me.\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 103)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creature explains his initial \u003cstrong\u003econfusion\u003c/strong\u003e on being brought into the world: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 105). Almost like a child, he learns to understand his senses, and begins to process his emotions. The creature becomes invested in the family in the cottage near where he lives and wishes to reveal himself to them:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.

Why did you form a monster so hideous that even \u003ci\u003eyou\u003c/i\u003e turned from me in disgust?\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 133). This part of the creature\u0026rsquo;s tale is likely to increase readers\u0026rsquo; \u003cstrong\u003esympathy\u003c/strong\u003e for him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-8rc5y\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe creature is alone and longs for a partner\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike his creator, the creature is characterized by his aloneness. But unlike Frankenstein, \u003cstrong\u003ehe does not choose to be alone\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; he wants to be part of society. Consequently, he asks Frankenstein to make him a companion, \u003cstrong\u003eclaiming that he has a right to be happy\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; and that Frankenstein is morally obliged to help him:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eThe creature is basically saying that he, like anyone else, needs love and affection from another being. If he had a partner, they could touch and comfort each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003ethe interchange of those sympathies\u003c/span\u003e necessary for my being. This you alone can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 147)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially, he makes rational arguments, trying to persuade Frankenstein to do as he asks: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable.\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 147). However, despite saying he won\u0026rsquo;t threaten Frankenstein, he quickly claims he will seek revenge if Frankenstein doesn\u0026rsquo;t make him a companion (p. 148).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike Frankenstein, the creature is \u003cstrong\u003eruled by a mixture of reason and passion\u003c/strong\u003e, which sometimes compete with each other: \u0026ldquo;A \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003eDevil-like or evil.\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003efiendish\u003c/span\u003e rage animated him as he said this; [\u0026hellip;] but presently he calmed himself as proceeded. \u0026lsquo;I intended to reason.

However, things change again when Frankenstein tears apart the companion for the creature which he has been working on. From that point on, the creature seeks \u003cstrong\u003erevenge\u003c/strong\u003e on Frankenstein. He then goes on to brutally murder Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s friend Clerval and his fianc\u0026eacute;e, Elizabeth.
