Although these themes prove to be<br />significant, none could be possible without the presence of <em>fate</em>. Without fate, love and hate cannot possibly be achieved. The word fate has many different connotations. Fate may often include an inevitable and adverse outcome - destiny. The destinies of Romeo and Juliet represent a self-controlled response with too many coincidences present to make it an arbitrary action.</p><p>The first example of fate in the play transpires in Act 1 Scene 2. Romeo and<br />Benvolio discover there is going to be a banquet held at the Capulet Mansion that evening. Capulet's servant is given a list of guests invited. Capulet's servant asks two strangers for help in reading it. The servant calls upon Romeo and Benvolio to assist him. Many declare that the fact that the servant asks the two men is fate in itself, based on the fact that the servant asked Romeo and Benvolio out of all the people that he possibly could ask, but actually in this instance, the two men are controlling fate.<br />Romeo knows by going to the Capulet's estate he will be in great jeopardy due to the <strong>rivalry between </strong>the <strong>Capulets</strong> and the <strong>Montagues</strong>. It is known that the party is only for those on the list and any Montague in attendance would be a vast disgrace to all Capulets. Although this fact is relevant to Romeo, he sees that the beloved Rosalind will be there and immediately insists upon attending the engagement.</p><p>Romeo has to make a very consequential <strong>decision</strong>. He can tempt the hands of fate and attend or he can make a wiser decision not to go. Nevertheless, Romeo places fate in his own hands and devises a plan with Benvolio to go to the Capulet mansion.<br />Some may argue that if Romeo did not go to the Capulet mansion then he would<br />never have discovered Juliet, but if fate is not self-controlled then Romeo and Juliet would be brought together one day by fate alone anyway. The fact that Romeo and Juliet would not have crossed paths presumably would have been better for all.<br />Romeo would not be in conflict with Tybalt for attending the party, therefore<br />Mercutio and Tybalt would still be alive. As well, Romeo and Juliet would not have to struggle with the fact that they are from conflicting families and might live instead of ending up dead. The individuals themselves control fate, in this scenario. Romeo decides his own fate and no one other than himself is responsible for the consequences of his decision.</p><p>Another part in the play where fate being a self-controlled action occurs is at<br />the Capulet mansion. Romeo attends the gathering with hopes to see Rosalind, who is supposedly Romeo's one and only true love. Romeo is in despair because Rosalind does not show the same kind of affection for Romeo. Juliet, who is a Capulet and Old Capulet's daughter, is also at the party. The two lay eyes on each other and instantaneously fall in love. Many incline to say that Romeo and Juliet meeting each other can only be fate, but if the facts are looked upon, by no stretch of the imagination did fate itself bring the two together. He is depressed and discouraged because Rosalind does not love Romeo back. Romeo is desperately looking for a true love and when he meets Juliet his spirits is strengthened. Juliet is also looking for love, but is being forced by her father into loving County Paris, whom she has no&nbsp;feelings for whatsoever. Fate did not bring Romeo and Juliet together; it was Romeo's decision to frequent the Capulet mansion that evening that consequently brought them together.</p><p>After meeting, Romeo and Juliet then shared the unfortunate fate of finding out they are from conflicting families. Romeo expresses his grievances when he says, "O dear account! my life is my foe's debt." (1. 5. 124) and Juliet expresses the same kind of emotion when she finds out that Romeo is her "love sprung from [her] only hate." (1.5. 146). These were a few expressions Romeo and Juliet exclaimed, respectively. Romeo and Juliet are in disbelief. The two wonder how it is possible that one is a Montague and the other is a Capulet. Juliet expresses her frustration with her soliloquy on the balcony when she ponders the question of "What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would still smell as sweet..." (2. 2. 45-46).<br />Romeo and Juliet think that fate is dealing them a bad hand, but it is not. If a deeper look is taken, many individuals in Verona are Capulets and many are Montagues.<br />Many who are not related are servants or employees of the families. One can see how it all ties together. Romeo and Juliet should not be surprised at all. It is what the two lovers do when the predicament is discovered that ultimately decides the fate of them both.</p><p>An additional act of self-controlled fate occurs when Mercutio is slain by<br />Tybalt and Romeo then kills Tybalt. Romeo killing Tybalt will only result in an<br />unmerciful future for Romeo. Many believe that it is fate that Tybalt is killed by<br />Romeo because nothing promising ever happens to Romeo. This statement is<br />incorrect. The reason why Mercutio dies by the hand of Tybalt is the untimely<br />ignorance of Romeo. Romeo tries to intervene during the duel, which gives Tybalt light to strike a substantial blow that ends Mercutio's life. Romeo has one of two choices that will decide his fate forever; walk away or seek revenge on Tybalt.<br />Romeo, filled with anger and adrenaline, attempts to obtain his revenge by taking the life of Tybalt. It is evident that Tybalt is an extremely skillful sword fighter by Mercutio's flattery of him when he states that Tybalt is, "more than Prince of Cats" (2.4. 19). "The very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist!" (2. 4. 3). With this said, Romeo is also tempting his own fate. Romeo has just married Juliet and already he could be turning Juliet into a very young widow. As well, Romeo is deciding the fate of his relationship with Juliet. If Romeo murders Tybalt there will be grave consequences to follow from not only the law officials, but from the Capulet family as well. If Romeo wants to be with Juliet, Romeo must attempt to make amends with Juliet's family. Killing Tybalt will only result in more hatred between the families that will in turn bring Romeo and Juliet further apart. Romeo mercilessly fights and kills Tybalt in the streets of Verona. After killing Tybalt Romeo exclaims, "O I am Fortune's fool." (3. 1. 132) meaning that the actions he has taken are not in his hands.<br />Romeo is saying this in hopes that it might make him feel better, but in reality Romeo has once again altered the outcome of fate. Romeo is banished from the city by the Prince of Verona. It will now be virtually impossible for Romeo and Juliet to be together.</p><p>One of the last dictations of fate occurs when Romeo hears from Balthasar of<br />Juliet's apparent death, "Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives." (5. 1. 18-19), Romeo then cries out, "Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!" (5. 1. 24). By saying this line, Romeo is stating that he will no longer let fate dictate his actions. Romeo acts in defiance, and visits a poor apothecary to purchase poison. Romeo plans to go back to Verona to lay in death with Juliet, his one true love.</p><p>Romeo states fate will no longer control the actions that have taken place, but fate alone has not controlled any of the actions throughout the play. Romeo has controlled fate. Romeo then travels back to Verona thinking Juliet is dead. Romeo utters his last few words to Juliet and drinks the toxic solution. The young boy's fate is decided.<br />Romeo's fate is ultimately death. Juliet then awakes and is overcome by grief seeing Romeo's death stricken body and decides to join Romeo. Juliet kisses the poison off Romeo's lips and finishes it off with a dagger.<br />Both Romeo and Juliet have not let fate solely adjudicate what happens to them<br />through the course of their lives. They both have single handily directed it believing that fate alone was against them, dictating the outcome of every situation, but it was not. If only Romeo and Juliet would have looked for another absolution, their fate could have changed for the better.</p><p><strong>Throughout the play</strong>, Romeo and Juliet have been so captivated with the<br />aspect of fate being their master, they have not realized that fate is a self-controlled reaction and they themselves are the only ones that can alter the outcome of their fate.</p><p>It is apparent in many examples throughout Shakespeare's tragedy, Romeo and<br />Juliet, that fate plays a critical role in the play from start to finish. Although Romeo and Juliet believe that fate is controlling what happens in the play, the characters themselves are actually controlling it. The self-control of fate is what makes the play so intriguing. In the long run the two star crossed lovers cannot put the blame on fate, only the way they controlled their fate can be blamed.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/william-shakespeare/romeo-si-julieta/summary" title="Summary of Romeo and Juliet" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a><a href="/william-shakespeare/romeo-si-julieta/characters" title="Romeo and Juliet | Characters" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Characters</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Although these themes prove to be\u003cbr /\u003esignificant, none could be possible without the presence of \u003cem\u003efate\u003c/em\u003e. Without fate, love and hate cannot possibly be achieved. The word fate has many different connotations. Fate may often include an inevitable and adverse outcome - destiny. The destinies of Romeo and Juliet represent a self-controlled response with too many coincidences present to make it an arbitrary action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first example of fate in the play transpires in Act 1 Scene 2. Romeo and\u003cbr /\u003eBenvolio discover there is going to be a banquet held at the Capulet Mansion that evening. Capulet\u0027s servant is given a list of guests invited. Capulet\u0027s servant asks two strangers for help in reading it. The servant calls upon Romeo and Benvolio to assist him. Many declare that the fact that the servant asks the two men is fate in itself, based on the fact that the servant asked Romeo and Benvolio out of all the people that he possibly could ask, but actually in this instance, the two men are controlling fate.\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo knows by going to the Capulet\u0027s estate he will be in great jeopardy due to the \u003cstrong\u003erivalry between \u003c/strong\u003ethe \u003cstrong\u003eCapulets\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003eMontagues\u003c/strong\u003e. It is known that the party is only for those on the list and any Montague in attendance would be a vast disgrace to all Capulets. Although this fact is relevant to Romeo, he sees that the beloved Rosalind will be there and immediately insists upon attending the engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRomeo has to make a very consequential \u003cstrong\u003edecision\u003c/strong\u003e. He can tempt the hands of fate and attend or he can make a wiser decision not to go. Nevertheless, Romeo places fate in his own hands and devises a plan with Benvolio to go to the Capulet mansion.\u003cbr /\u003eSome may argue that if Romeo did not go to the Capulet mansion then he would\u003cbr /\u003enever have discovered Juliet, but if fate is not self-controlled then Romeo and Juliet would be brought together one day by fate alone anyway. The fact that Romeo and Juliet would not have crossed paths presumably would have been better for all.\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo would not be in conflict with Tybalt for attending the party, therefore\u003cbr /\u003eMercutio and Tybalt would still be alive. As well, Romeo and Juliet would not have to struggle with the fact that they are from conflicting families and might live instead of ending up dead. The individuals themselves control fate, in this scenario. Romeo decides his own fate and no one other than himself is responsible for the consequences of his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother part in the play where fate being a self-controlled action occurs is at\u003cbr /\u003ethe Capulet mansion. Romeo attends the gathering with hopes to see Rosalind, who is supposedly Romeo\u0027s one and only true love. Romeo is in despair because Rosalind does not show the same kind of affection for Romeo. Juliet, who is a Capulet and Old Capulet\u0027s daughter, is also at the party. The two lay eyes on each other and instantaneously fall in love. Many incline to say that Romeo and Juliet meeting each other can only be fate, but if the facts are looked upon, by no stretch of the imagination did fate itself bring the two together. He is depressed and discouraged because Rosalind does not love Romeo back. Romeo is desperately looking for a true love and when he meets Juliet his spirits is strengthened. Juliet is also looking for love, but is being forced by her father into loving County Paris, whom she has no\u0026nbsp;feelings for whatsoever. Fate did not bring Romeo and Juliet together; it was Romeo\u0027s decision to frequent the Capulet mansion that evening that consequently brought them together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter meeting, Romeo and Juliet then shared the unfortunate fate of finding out they are from conflicting families. Romeo expresses his grievances when he says, \u0022O dear account! my life is my foe\u0027s debt.\u0022 (1. 5. 124) and Juliet expresses the same kind of emotion when she finds out that Romeo is her \u0022love sprung from [her] only hate.\u0022 (1.5. 146). These were a few expressions Romeo and Juliet exclaimed, respectively. Romeo and Juliet are in disbelief. The two wonder how it is possible that one is a Montague and the other is a Capulet. Juliet expresses her frustration with her soliloquy on the balcony when she ponders the question of \u0022What\u0027s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would still smell as sweet...\u0022 (2. 2. 45-46).\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo and Juliet think that fate is dealing them a bad hand, but it is not. If a deeper look is taken, many individuals in Verona are Capulets and many are Montagues.\u003cbr /\u003eMany who are not related are servants or employees of the families. One can see how it all ties together. Romeo and Juliet should not be surprised at all. It is what the two lovers do when the predicament is discovered that ultimately decides the fate of them both.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn additional act of self-controlled fate occurs when Mercutio is slain by\u003cbr /\u003eTybalt and Romeo then kills Tybalt. Romeo killing Tybalt will only result in an\u003cbr /\u003eunmerciful future for Romeo. Many believe that it is fate that Tybalt is killed by\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo because nothing promising ever happens to Romeo. This statement is\u003cbr /\u003eincorrect. The reason why Mercutio dies by the hand of Tybalt is the untimely\u003cbr /\u003eignorance of Romeo. Romeo tries to intervene during the duel, which gives Tybalt light to strike a substantial blow that ends Mercutio\u0027s life. Romeo has one of two choices that will decide his fate forever; walk away or seek revenge on Tybalt.\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo, filled with anger and adrenaline, attempts to obtain his revenge by taking the life of Tybalt. It is evident that Tybalt is an extremely skillful sword fighter by Mercutio\u0027s flattery of him when he states that Tybalt is, \u0022more than Prince of Cats\u0022 (2.4. 19). \u0022The very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist!\u0022 (2. 4. 3). With this said, Romeo is also tempting his own fate. Romeo has just married Juliet and already he could be turning Juliet into a very young widow. As well, Romeo is deciding the fate of his relationship with Juliet. If Romeo murders Tybalt there will be grave consequences to follow from not only the law officials, but from the Capulet family as well. If Romeo wants to be with Juliet, Romeo must attempt to make amends with Juliet\u0027s family. Killing Tybalt will only result in more hatred between the families that will in turn bring Romeo and Juliet further apart. Romeo mercilessly fights and kills Tybalt in the streets of Verona. After killing Tybalt Romeo exclaims, \u0022O I am Fortune\u0027s fool.\u0022 (3. 1. 132) meaning that the actions he has taken are not in his hands.\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo is saying this in hopes that it might make him feel better, but in reality Romeo has once again altered the outcome of fate. Romeo is banished from the city by the Prince of Verona. It will now be virtually impossible for Romeo and Juliet to be together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the last dictations of fate occurs when Romeo hears from Balthasar of\u003cbr /\u003eJuliet\u0027s apparent death, \u0022Her body sleeps in Capels\u0027 monument, And her immortal part with angels lives.\u0022 (5. 1. 18-19), Romeo then cries out, \u0022Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!\u0022 (5. 1. 24). By saying this line, Romeo is stating that he will no longer let fate dictate his actions. Romeo acts in defiance, and visits a poor apothecary to purchase poison. Romeo plans to go back to Verona to lay in death with Juliet, his one true love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRomeo states fate will no longer control the actions that have taken place, but fate alone has not controlled any of the actions throughout the play. Romeo has controlled fate. Romeo then travels back to Verona thinking Juliet is dead. Romeo utters his last few words to Juliet and drinks the toxic solution. The young boy\u0027s fate is decided.\u003cbr /\u003eRomeo\u0027s fate is ultimately death. Juliet then awakes and is overcome by grief seeing Romeo\u0027s death stricken body and decides to join Romeo. Juliet kisses the poison off Romeo\u0027s lips and finishes it off with a dagger.\u003cbr /\u003eBoth Romeo and Juliet have not let fate solely adjudicate what happens to them\u003cbr /\u003ethrough the course of their lives. They both have single handily directed it believing that fate alone was against them, dictating the outcome of every situation, but it was not.
