Oliver Twist is a well-known classic, and it has been the subject of numerous film and television adaptations.</p><h2 id="heading-tbo2g" title="ID: heading-tbo2g" data-guid="3f555883-2775-4713-9e43-20e47f56d405"><strong>The setting</strong></h2><p>The story takes place in England during the industrial revolution. There is no exact date mentioned, but because of the system Dickens is referring to is very much alike the system after the Poor Law was established, in 1834. London is the primary setting for the novel, and it is repeatedly described as a labyrinth- once you get into it, it&rsquo;s hard to get back out. It&rsquo;s filthy, foggy and serves as a kind of prison.</p><p>The country village where Oliver follows the Maylies on a vacation is in glaring contrast to London. The narrator suggests that the country can &ldquo;cure&rdquo; som of the bad effects of the city. But even in the country, Oliver isn&rsquo;t safe from Fagin&rsquo;s criminal network. Dickens might be suggesting that the city is more powerful &ndash; its evil representatives, after all, are able to penetrate into the country, while elements of country life seem only able to survive on the fringes of the city.</p><h2 id="heading-rkvve" title="ID: heading-rkvve" data-guid="b3e8dfd1-35ef-4c23-9db5-cced48905b04"><strong>Plot summary</strong></h2><p>The novel is about an orphan child named Oliver Twist, who was born into a misery life of poverty and misfortune. He spends his first ten years of his life in different kinds of orphanages and workhouses, where he gets beaten and starved of the &ldquo;nobel protectors of the poor&rdquo;, until one day when he decides to run away to London. &nbsp;</p><p>During his journey, Oliver encounters the Artful Dodger. He provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a great gentleman who is willing to give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change. Grateful for the opportunity, he follows the Dodger to the house, but when he gets there, he realizes that he has been deceived. The &ldquo;great gentleman&rdquo;, whose name was Fagin, was the leader for a gang of pick pockets. Oliver Twist is forced to join them in their illegal way of making money, and the problems keep building up in front of him.</p><h2 id="heading-1hp1u" title="ID: heading-1hp1u" data-guid="d6ed9edc-e035-4f7a-9ebf-c67f2dded072"><strong>Themes</strong></h2><p>Good vs. evil.&nbsp;<br>Dickens makes considerable use of symbolism. The many obstacles Oliver Twist faces in the novel symbolises primarily good versus evil. The evil is continually trying to corrupt and exploit the good, but the good wins out in the end. Fagin is a good example for evil. His satanic characteristics, which corrupt young boys&rsquo; minds and make them steel for him, while he is sitting home and counting money.</p><p>The representative for good is Mr. Brownlow, with his purity, integrity and kindness.&nbsp;<br>He is brought in the story with a very indirect presentation, but it is not long after introducing him that his whole presentation is revealed to us. When he finds out that he wrongfully convicted Oliver of thieving, he starts concerning over Oliver&rsquo;s welfare, and convince Oliver to live with him. With honesty and great wealth as his prime qualities, he assists Oliver in his time of need.</p><p>The London slums are the perfect metaphor for hell. The dark deeds happen in the dark, suffocating city. In contrast, the countryside where the Maylies take Oliver is heaven. London Bridge work as a link between good and evil, because it&rsquo;s on the bridge Nancy has the opportunity to decide whether she wants to cross over to the better way of life, but she rejects because she think it is too late for her.</p><p>Satire of the Poor Laws.<br>Another important theme is the failure of charity at that time. Much of the first part of the novel challenges the organizations of charity run by the church and the government at that time. Poor could only receive government assistance if they moved into government workhouses, and they had not really any options, because it was against the law to beg on the streets. The conditions at these workhouses were frightful. Labor was required, families were almost always separated, and the rations of food and clothing were meager. The workhouses operated on the principle that poverty was the consequence of laziness and that the dreadful conditions in the workhouse would inspire the poor to better their own circumstances. But in reality, the officials who ran the workhouse blatantly violated the values they preached about to the poor, because they were probably the most greedy and lazy, like Mrs Mann for instance. In general, charitable institutions only reproduced the awful conditions in which the poor would live anyway. As Dickens puts it, the poor choose between &ldquo;being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Characters&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 id="heading-90uvk" title="ID: heading-90uvk">Oliver Twist</h3><p>As told, Oliver was born poor and with no parents. His mother died right after his birth, and the father are not even mentioned. Oliver is a sensitive, compassionate, kind, loyal and gentle boy, no matter how much he is abused and mistreated. He retained these qualities as well as his deep faith in the goodness of people. If it was because of his strong moral, or if he just was extremely naïve, is hard to say. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t recognise the evil around him? Although he is badly treated by many people and comes to fear them, he never hates them and he has tremendous amount of empathy. We can see that at the end of the novel, when Oliver prays for Fagin.</p><p>But he is rather naïve at times. For example, when he sees the members of Fagin&rsquo;s gang practicing stealing Fagin&rsquo;s wallet, and when he goes out with them to steal, but have no idea they are thieves until they run off, and he is accused for the deed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="heading-f4kvj" title="ID: heading-f4kvj">Nancy</h3><p>As a child of the streets, Nancy has been a thief and a prostitute since she was very young. Nancy&rsquo;s moral complexity is unique among the characters in Oliver Twist, where morality and nobility are black-and-white issues, but Nancy&rsquo;s character suggests that the boundary between virtue and vice is not always clearly drawn. Although she is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to help Oliver to flee and commits perhaps the noblest act in the novel when she sacrifices her own life in order to protect Oliver.</p><h3 id="heading-z3rhw" title="ID: heading-z3rhw">Fagin</h3><p>Fagin is a master criminal and the head of the gang of child thieves. His main goal is to exploit the people around him so he can better his situation and strengthen his power. He is the main evil character of the novel, and he is occasionally referred to as &ldquo;the old one&rdquo;, which is a popular nickname for the devil. He is described like a ugly and filthy jew, with red hair and matted, red beard, with no loyalty to anyone but himself. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-vllkv" title="ID: heading-vllkv" data-guid="4849c687-9570-480c-a361-9478aa7fc2fa"><strong>The language</strong></h2><p>Charles Dickens is one of the most recognized authors of the English literature. His way of writing is very fascinating, because he is one of the few authors I know, who can describe and capture time, place and characters as realistic as him. The language is very rich and creative, and it hits you right in the heart when you read. The text is almost filled up to its limmit with direct speech, which contributes to a more dramatically and realistic feeling. The plot progress in chronological order, but gives the reader small hints about the future. Who the narrator is, is difficult to say, because we never get to now anything about him. The only thing we do know about him is that he is left outside the story.</p><p>Many may think he fills the novel with too many characters, but in this case it is important for the story&rsquo;s sake. This is because it is not Oliver who is in control of where he is going in his life. Every character brings him to a new place in the novel.</p><p>But you have to be focused and concentrated when you read the novel, because it can be &ldquo;a little too much&rdquo; some times, because of the time it was written in. The language in the nineteenth century was very detailed and formal, because the time aloud it to be so. They had no television or radio which could have made it easier to them.</p><h2 id="heading-xhkmz" title="ID: heading-xhkmz" data-guid="5951fdd9-65ec-47f3-a6f7-6e0d258bacab"><strong>Personal Opinion</strong></h2><p>Just as much as I enjoyed the book the first and the second time I read it, I enjoyed it third. It has been one of my favourite books since I was a little child, and I think it will stay that way until the day I die. The fact that Oliver manage to keep his strong morals regardless how the society and the people around him are trying to affect him, is beautiful. It&rsquo;s amazing how a little boy can go through so much, without getting desperate. He hold on to his belief knowing that he will get what he deserves in the end. Every time I read it, it&rsquo;s almost like the book gives me a new perspective of life.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/charles-dickens/oliver-twist/rezumat" title="Oliver Twist de Charles Dickens | Rezumat" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span></a></div></div></div></div>

Oliver Twist is a well-known classic, and it has been the subject of numerous film and television adaptations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-tbo2g\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tbo2g\u0022 data-guid=\u00223f555883-2775-4713-9e43-20e47f56d405\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe setting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story takes place in England during the industrial revolution. There is no exact date mentioned, but because of the system Dickens is referring to is very much alike the system after the Poor Law was established, in 1834. London is the primary setting for the novel, and it is repeatedly described as a labyrinth- once you get into it, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get back out. It\u0026rsquo;s filthy, foggy and serves as a kind of prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe country village where Oliver follows the Maylies on a vacation is in glaring contrast to London. The narrator suggests that the country can \u0026ldquo;cure\u0026rdquo; som of the bad effects of the city. But even in the country, Oliver isn\u0026rsquo;t safe from Fagin\u0026rsquo;s criminal network. Dickens might be suggesting that the city is more powerful \u0026ndash; its evil representatives, after all, are able to penetrate into the country, while elements of country life seem only able to survive on the fringes of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-rkvve\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-rkvve\u0022 data-guid=\u0022b3e8dfd1-35ef-4c23-9db5-cced48905b04\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlot summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novel is about an orphan child named Oliver Twist, who was born into a misery life of poverty and misfortune. He spends his first ten years of his life in different kinds of orphanages and workhouses, where he gets beaten and starved of the \u0026ldquo;nobel protectors of the poor\u0026rdquo;, until one day when he decides to run away to London. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring his journey, Oliver encounters the Artful Dodger. He provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a great gentleman who is willing to give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change. Grateful for the opportunity, he follows the Dodger to the house, but when he gets there, he realizes that he has been deceived. The \u0026ldquo;great gentleman\u0026rdquo;, whose name was Fagin, was the leader for a gang of pick pockets. Oliver Twist is forced to join them in their illegal way of making money, and the problems keep building up in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-1hp1u\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-1hp1u\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d6ed9edc-e035-4f7a-9ebf-c67f2dded072\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThemes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood vs. evil.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eDickens makes considerable use of symbolism. The many obstacles Oliver Twist faces in the novel symbolises primarily good versus evil. The evil is continually trying to corrupt and exploit the good, but the good wins out in the end. Fagin is a good example for evil. His satanic characteristics, which corrupt young boys\u0026rsquo; minds and make them steel for him, while he is sitting home and counting money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe representative for good is Mr. Brownlow, with his purity, integrity and kindness.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eHe is brought in the story with a very indirect presentation, but it is not long after introducing him that his whole presentation is revealed to us. When he finds out that he wrongfully convicted Oliver of thieving, he starts concerning over Oliver\u0026rsquo;s welfare, and convince Oliver to live with him. With honesty and great wealth as his prime qualities, he assists Oliver in his time of need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe London slums are the perfect metaphor for hell. The dark deeds happen in the dark, suffocating city. In contrast, the countryside where the Maylies take Oliver is heaven. London Bridge work as a link between good and evil, because it\u0026rsquo;s on the bridge Nancy has the opportunity to decide whether she wants to cross over to the better way of life, but she rejects because she think it is too late for her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSatire of the Poor Laws.\u003cbr\u003eAnother important theme is the failure of charity at that time. Much of the first part of the novel challenges the organizations of charity run by the church and the government at that time. Poor could only receive government assistance if they moved into government workhouses, and they had not really any options, because it was against the law to beg on the streets. The conditions at these workhouses were frightful. Labor was required, families were almost always separated, and the rations of food and clothing were meager. The workhouses operated on the principle that poverty was the consequence of laziness and that the dreadful conditions in the workhouse would inspire the poor to better their own circumstances. But in reality, the officials who ran the workhouse blatantly violated the values they preached about to the poor, because they were probably the most greedy and lazy, like Mrs Mann for instance. In general, charitable institutions only reproduced the awful conditions in which the poor would live anyway. As Dickens puts it, the poor choose between \u0026ldquo;being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacters\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-90uvk\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-90uvk\u0022\u003eOliver Twist\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs told, Oliver was born poor and with no parents. His mother died right after his birth, and the father are not even mentioned. Oliver is a sensitive, compassionate, kind, loyal and gentle boy, no matter how much he is abused and mistreated. He retained these qualities as well as his deep faith in the goodness of people. If it was because of his strong moral, or if he just was extremely naïve, is hard to say. Maybe he didn\u0026rsquo;t recognise the evil around him? Although he is badly treated by many people and comes to fear them, he never hates them and he has tremendous amount of empathy. We can see that at the end of the novel, when Oliver prays for Fagin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut he is rather naïve at times. For example, when he sees the members of Fagin\u0026rsquo;s gang practicing stealing Fagin\u0026rsquo;s wallet, and when he goes out with them to steal, but have no idea they are thieves until they run off, and he is accused for the deed. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-f4kvj\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-f4kvj\u0022\u003eNancy\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a child of the streets, Nancy has been a thief and a prostitute since she was very young. Nancy\u0026rsquo;s moral complexity is unique among the characters in Oliver Twist, where morality and nobility are black-and-white issues, but Nancy\u0026rsquo;s character suggests that the boundary between virtue and vice is not always clearly drawn. Although she is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to help Oliver to flee and commits perhaps the noblest act in the novel when she sacrifices her own life in order to protect Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-z3rhw\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-z3rhw\u0022\u003eFagin\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFagin is a master criminal and the head of the gang of child thieves. His main goal is to exploit the people around him so he can better his situation and strengthen his power. He is the main evil character of the novel, and he is occasionally referred to as \u0026ldquo;the old one\u0026rdquo;, which is a popular nickname for the devil. He is described like a ugly and filthy jew, with red hair and matted, red beard, with no loyalty to anyone but himself. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-vllkv\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-vllkv\u0022 data-guid=\u00224849c687-9570-480c-a361-9478aa7fc2fa\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe language\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCharles Dickens is one of the most recognized authors of the English literature. His way of writing is very fascinating, because he is one of the few authors I know, who can describe and capture time, place and characters as realistic as him. The language is very rich and creative, and it hits you right in the heart when you read. The text is almost filled up to its limmit with direct speech, which contributes to a more dramatically and realistic feeling. The plot progress in chronological order, but gives the reader small hints about the future. Who the narrator is, is difficult to say, because we never get to now anything about him. The only thing we do know about him is that he is left outside the story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany may think he fills the novel with too many characters, but in this case it is important for the story\u0026rsquo;s sake. This is because it is not Oliver who is in control of where he is going in his life. Every character brings him to a new place in the novel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut you have to be focused and concentrated when you read the novel, because it can be \u0026ldquo;a little too much\u0026rdquo; some times, because of the time it was written in. The language in the nineteenth century was very detailed and formal, because the time aloud it to be so. They had no television or radio which could have made it easier to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-xhkmz\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-xhkmz\u0022 data-guid=\u00225951fdd9-65ec-47f3-a6f7-6e0d258bacab\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal Opinion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust as much as I enjoyed the book the first and the second time I read it, I enjoyed it third. It has been one of my favourite books since I was a little child, and I think it will stay that way until the day I die. The fact that Oliver manage to keep his strong morals regardless how the society and the people around him are trying to affect him, is beautiful. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how a little boy can go through so much, without getting desperate. He hold on to his belief knowing that he will get what he deserves in the end. Every time I read it, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like the book gives me a new perspective of life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Oliver Twist de Charles Dickens | Analysis","MetaDescription":"Oliver Twist was written by the English author Charles Dickens, and was originally published as a serial in the magazine, Bentley’s Miscellany, in monthly installments from 1837 to 1839.
