The story begins in Umuofia, a group of nine villages in Nigeria, in the late 1880s, before missionaries and other outsiders have arrived. Much of the novel deals with the characters' polytheistic religion, consisting of many gods, and the society of Umoufia is also patriarchal, meaning males are the dominant gender. The Ibo clan practices common tribal traditions such as worship of gods, sacrifice, communal living, war, and magic. Leadership is based on a man's personal worth and his contribution to the tribe. Okonkwo, the protagonist of the novel, stands out as a great leader of the Ibo tribe, and is respected for his many achievements. He has earned his social status, and is hard working and shows no weakness to anyone. He is wealthy, courageous and powerful. Okonkwo&rsquo;s relationship with his father shapes much of his violent and ambitious demeanour. He wants to rise above his father&rsquo;s legacy of spendthrift, indolent behaviour, which he views as weak and therefore effeminate. He matches the ideals of how a man should be like in this patriarchal community. However, things begin to go wrong for Okonkwo and he shocks his community when he severely beats his youngest wife, breaking the peace of the sacred week. When he accidentally kills a young tribesman at a funeral ceremony, he and his family are sent into exile for seven years to appease the gods he has offended with the murder. While Okonkwo is away in exile, white men begin to arrive at Umuofia and they peaceably introduce their religion. As the number of converts increases, the foothold of the white people grows beyond their religion and a new government is introduced. Upon his return to the village, Okonkwo finds a tribe divided by the influence of missionaries and English bureaucrats who have interrupted the routine of tradition. He and other tribal leaders try to reclaim their hold on their native land by destroying a local Christian church. In return, the leader of the white government throws them into jail, where the native leaders suffer insults and physical abuse. The people of Umuofia finally gather for what could be a great uprising, but some messengers of the white government try to stop the meeting. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader, but when the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes with despair that his clan is not willing to stand up to the Europeans. When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo&rsquo;s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. This ending is kind of contradictory, because Okonkwo takes his own life in denial of the changes brought upon his home, and because he values tradition more than change, but at the same time, suicide is regarded as a very grave sin in the traditional Umoufia. So in his great refuse to join the new and changed society, he actually ends up giving up his high-valued traditions.</p><p>In this novel, Achebe <strong>focuses </strong>on the <strong>conflict </strong>that arises when tradition clashes with change, and the novel depicts conflicts and tensions within Ibo society as well as changes introduced by colonial rule and Christianity. In contacts between different cultures, beliefs about superiority or inferiority are invariably wrong-headed and destructive. When new cultures and religions meet, there is likely to be a fight for dominance like it is described in this novel. In his description of the struggle between change and tradition, Achebe moves in on a complex so relevant, a complex that have always and will always be relevant. There is no such thing as a static culture; change is continual, and flexibility is necessary for successful adaptation. The tension about whether change should be privileged over tradition often involves questions of personal status. To some extent, Okonkwo&rsquo;s resistance of cultural change is due to his fear of losing societal status, because his sense of self-worth is dependent upon the traditional standards by which society judges him. When Okonkwo cannot accept the change the Christians bring, he cannot adapt and he is pushed away from society and the people that can adapt. The struggle between change and tradition is constant, and a rigid individual, unable to adjust oneself to new conditions, is liable to be tragically swept aside by history.&nbsp;</p><p>The villagers in general are trapped between resisting and embracing alteration and they face the dilemma of trying to determine how best to adjust to the reality of change. The villagers are excited about the new opportunities and techniques that the missionaries bring, but at the same time, the European influence threatens to extinguish the need for the mastery of traditional methods of farming, harvesting, building, and cooking. These traditional methods, once crucial for survival, are now, to varying degrees, dispensable. In the novel, Achebe shows how reliant such traditions are upon storytelling and language and thus how quickly the abandonment of the Igbo language for English could lead to the eradication of these traditions.</p><p>Different <strong>themes </strong>throughout the novel include, loneliness, abandonment, fear, and importance of social relationships, which is depicted by Okonkwo's uncle, Uchendu: <i>"We are better than animals because we have kinsmen. An animal rubs its itching flank against a tree, a man asks his kinsman to scratch him."</i> Also varying interpretations of masculinity is represented throughout the novel, as one of the main differences between the western culture and the tradition-minded habitants of Umoufia, besides religion and structure of government.&nbsp;</p><p>Another momentous <strong>theme </strong>behind this novel is language as a sign of cultural difference. Achebe uses his characters and their unique <strong>language </strong>to portray the double tragedies that occur in the story, and readers identify not only with Okonkwo and his personal hardships but also with the Ibo culture and its disintegration. Achebe emphasizes that Africa is not the silent or incomprehensible country that it is often made out to be. By peppering the novel with Igbo words, Achebe shows that the Igbo language is too complex for direct translation into English. Similarly, Igbo culture cannot be understood within the framework of European colonialist values. On a macroscopic level, it is extremely significant that Achebe chose to write Things Fall Apart in English, as he clearly addresses the West at least as much, if not more, than his fellow Nigerians. His goal was to critique and emend the portrait of Africa that was painted by so many writers of the colonial period, and also to get across the truth about the effects of losing one's culture, which is something most western societies have never experienced. Through his inclusion of proverbs, folktales, and songs translated from the Igbo language, Achebe has managed to capture and convey the rhythms, structures, cadences, and beauty of the Igbo language even though the novel is written in English.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/chinua-achebe/o-lume-se-destrama/rezumat" title="Rezumat | O lume se destrama de Chinua Achebe" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Rezumat</span></a></div></div></div></div>

The story begins in Umuofia, a group of nine villages in Nigeria, in the late 1880s, before missionaries and other outsiders have arrived. Much of the novel deals with the characters\u0027 polytheistic religion, consisting of many gods, and the society of Umoufia is also patriarchal, meaning males are the dominant gender. The Ibo clan practices common tribal traditions such as worship of gods, sacrifice, communal living, war, and magic. Leadership is based on a man\u0027s personal worth and his contribution to the tribe. Okonkwo, the protagonist of the novel, stands out as a great leader of the Ibo tribe, and is respected for his many achievements. He has earned his social status, and is hard working and shows no weakness to anyone. He is wealthy, courageous and powerful. Okonkwo\u0026rsquo;s relationship with his father shapes much of his violent and ambitious demeanour. He wants to rise above his father\u0026rsquo;s legacy of spendthrift, indolent behaviour, which he views as weak and therefore effeminate. He matches the ideals of how a man should be like in this patriarchal community. However, things begin to go wrong for Okonkwo and he shocks his community when he severely beats his youngest wife, breaking the peace of the sacred week. When he accidentally kills a young tribesman at a funeral ceremony, he and his family are sent into exile for seven years to appease the gods he has offended with the murder. While Okonkwo is away in exile, white men begin to arrive at Umuofia and they peaceably introduce their religion. As the number of converts increases, the foothold of the white people grows beyond their religion and a new government is introduced. Upon his return to the village, Okonkwo finds a tribe divided by the influence of missionaries and English bureaucrats who have interrupted the routine of tradition. He and other tribal leaders try to reclaim their hold on their native land by destroying a local Christian church. In return, the leader of the white government throws them into jail, where the native leaders suffer insults and physical abuse. The people of Umuofia finally gather for what could be a great uprising, but some messengers of the white government try to stop the meeting. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader, but when the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes with despair that his clan is not willing to stand up to the Europeans. When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo\u0026rsquo;s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. This ending is kind of contradictory, because Okonkwo takes his own life in denial of the changes brought upon his home, and because he values tradition more than change, but at the same time, suicide is regarded as a very grave sin in the traditional Umoufia. So in his great refuse to join the new and changed society, he actually ends up giving up his high-valued traditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this novel, Achebe \u003cstrong\u003efocuses \u003c/strong\u003eon the \u003cstrong\u003econflict \u003c/strong\u003ethat arises when tradition clashes with change, and the novel depicts conflicts and tensions within Ibo society as well as changes introduced by colonial rule and Christianity. In contacts between different cultures, beliefs about superiority or inferiority are invariably wrong-headed and destructive. When new cultures and religions meet, there is likely to be a fight for dominance like it is described in this novel. In his description of the struggle between change and tradition, Achebe moves in on a complex so relevant, a complex that have always and will always be relevant. There is no such thing as a static culture; change is continual, and flexibility is necessary for successful adaptation. The tension about whether change should be privileged over tradition often involves questions of personal status. To some extent, Okonkwo\u0026rsquo;s resistance of cultural change is due to his fear of losing societal status, because his sense of self-worth is dependent upon the traditional standards by which society judges him. When Okonkwo cannot accept the change the Christians bring, he cannot adapt and he is pushed away from society and the people that can adapt. The struggle between change and tradition is constant, and a rigid individual, unable to adjust oneself to new conditions, is liable to be tragically swept aside by history.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe villagers in general are trapped between resisting and embracing alteration and they face the dilemma of trying to determine how best to adjust to the reality of change. The villagers are excited about the new opportunities and techniques that the missionaries bring, but at the same time, the European influence threatens to extinguish the need for the mastery of traditional methods of farming, harvesting, building, and cooking. These traditional methods, once crucial for survival, are now, to varying degrees, dispensable. In the novel, Achebe shows how reliant such traditions are upon storytelling and language and thus how quickly the abandonment of the Igbo language for English could lead to the eradication of these traditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDifferent \u003cstrong\u003ethemes \u003c/strong\u003ethroughout the novel include, loneliness, abandonment, fear, and importance of social relationships, which is depicted by Okonkwo\u0027s uncle, Uchendu: \u003ci\u003e\u0022We are better than animals because we have kinsmen. An animal rubs its itching flank against a tree, a man asks his kinsman to scratch him.\u0022\u003c/i\u003e Also varying interpretations of masculinity is represented throughout the novel, as one of the main differences between the western culture and the tradition-minded habitants of Umoufia, besides religion and structure of government.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother momentous \u003cstrong\u003etheme \u003c/strong\u003ebehind this novel is language as a sign of cultural difference. Achebe uses his characters and their unique \u003cstrong\u003elanguage \u003c/strong\u003eto portray the double tragedies that occur in the story, and readers identify not only with Okonkwo and his personal hardships but also with the Ibo culture and its disintegration. Achebe emphasizes that Africa is not the silent or incomprehensible country that it is often made out to be. By peppering the novel with Igbo words, Achebe shows that the Igbo language is too complex for direct translation into English. Similarly, Igbo culture cannot be understood within the framework of European colonialist values. On a macroscopic level, it is extremely significant that Achebe chose to write Things Fall Apart in English, as he clearly addresses the West at least as much, if not more, than his fellow Nigerians. His goal was to critique and emend the portrait of Africa that was painted by so many writers of the colonial period, and also to get across the truth about the effects of losing one\u0027s culture, which is something most western societies have never experienced. Through his inclusion of proverbs, folktales, and songs translated from the Igbo language, Achebe has managed to capture and convey the rhythms, structures, cadences, and beauty of the Igbo language even though the novel is written in English.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Analysis of Things Fall Apart","MetaDescription":"Things Fall Apart is a novel written by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe in 1958.
