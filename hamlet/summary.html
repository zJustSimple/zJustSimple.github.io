The king has died unexpectedly from the effects of a snakebite, and his brother Claudius now sits on the throne.</p><p>Claudius publicly mourns his brother's death, but at the same time rejoices in his quick marriage to Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. Hamlet is shocked and disgusted that his mother has remarried so quickly to his uncle. Unlike the others, he sincerely mourns his father's death.</p><p>One evening, two guards of the castle see a ghost that looks very much like the deceased king. Therefore, they summon Horatio, a friend of Hamlet&rsquo;s. He can confirm their statements with his own eyes and then informs Hamlet about the event. Hamlet keeps them company during the next watch and meets the ghost of his father. Prince Hamlet learns from his father&rsquo;s ghost that he was poisoned cold-bloodedly by Claudius while he slept. The ghost demands that Hamlet take revenge on the murderous criminal, but at the same time asks him to spare his mother.</p><p>Hamlet then decides to pretend to be insane in order to carry out his revenge plan undisturbed, and begins to utter seemingly incoherent and ambiguous sentences. He can confide in no one but his college friend Horatio. His beloved Ophelia has been urged by her brother Laertes and her father Polonius to stay away from him. They do not believe that his vows of love to her were ever sincere.</p><p>The chief counselor Polonius thinks that Hamlet's confusion is caused by his unrequited love for Ophelia. The queen, on the other hand, believes that her son's bizarre behavior is caused by grief over his father's death. The king is the only one who suspects something else. He has his advisor Polonius arrange a conversation between Hamlet and Ophelia, which the two then eavesdrop on without success. When Hamlet realizes that Ophelia wants to spy on him, he further pretends to be insane by suddenly rejecting her and asking her to go to a monastery.</p><p>The suspicious king then orders two childhood friends of Hamlet&rsquo;s, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to Denmark to get to the bottom of Hamlet's alleged madness. However, they do not succeed in winning their old friend&rsquo;s trust. Hamlet immediately guesses that the two have been sent by the king to spy on him. From now on, he sees them only as the new king's henchmen and no longer trusts them.</p><p>When a group of actors comes to the court, Hamlet seizes the opportunity to check the ghost's accusations of murder for their accuracy. He asks the company to re-enact the scene of the <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>&amp;nbsp;murder of a king</p>">regicide </span>in the play "The Murder of Gonzago." If Claudius loses his temper during the play, Hamlet believes he can be sure that Claudius is indeed his father's murderer. Hamlet is plagued by suicidal thoughts before the performance.</p><p>When the poisoning scene is acted, Claudius suddenly leaves the room, agitated. Hamlet is now convinced of his guilt. Claudius then prays for forgiveness for murdering his brother. When Hamlet finds him praying, he plays with the idea of killing him immediately, but then decides against it.</p><p>After the play, Hamlet meets his mother, who tries to bring him back to his senses. The conversation is overheard by Polonius. However, the quarrel between mother and son escalates. When Polonius calls for help for Gertrude, Hamlet kills him with a stab through the curtain, having mistaken him for Claudius. The ghost of the deceased king then appears and reminds Hamlet of his plan for revenge. Since Gertrude cannot see the ghost, she is now even more convinced that her son has fallen prey to madness. Hamlet, however, is able to reassure her that he has not gone mad. He asks her to behave virtuously from now on. The two reconcile and Gertrude promises to keep the conversation secret.</p><p>The king suspects that Hamlet has found out the truth about his father's death and sends him to England together with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Claudius wants to have Hamlet killed there. On the journey to England, however, the suspicious Hamlet discovers Claudius' death sentence in a secret letter and changes its contents: it no longer demands his execution, but that of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Hamlet returns to Denmark to carry out his revenge against Claudius, while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are killed in England.</p><p>Laertes, Ophelia's brother, returns from his studies in Paris after Polonius' death. He storms the castle with an angry crowd of soldiers, demanding revenge from Claudius for his father's murder and unworthy burial. Claudius, however, manages to redirect Laertes' anger toward Hamlet and convince him that Hamlet is Polonius' murderer. When they learn that Hamlet is still alive and is returning to Denmark, they plot to make Hamlet's death in a duel look like an accident: Laertes is to challenge Hamlet to a sporting fencing duel, secretly using a poisoned blade.</p><p>Ophelia, meanwhile, has been driven mad by Hamlet's rejection and the murder of her father. She is found dead in a river later in the play. When Laertes learns of his sister's death, he falls into deep mourning. At Ophelia's funeral, he meets Hamlet, whom he hates. At the open grave, the two engage in a bitter quarrel.</p><p>Claudius arranges a duel between Laertes and Hamlet in the throne room and in the presence of the king and queen. The duel is supposed to take place with blunt weapons, but Laertes' <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>a long, slender two-edged sword used in the 1500&rsquo;s and 1600&rsquo;s</p>">rapier </span>point is sharpened and poisoned as planned. Claudius has prepared a poisoned potion for Hamlet as a precaution, to kill Hamlet if he survives the duel unhurt.&nbsp;</p><p>Claudius&rsquo; and Laertes&rsquo; plan goes wrong, however, and ends in a bloodbath: Hamlet is first injured by Laertes. The queen drinks unsuspectingly from the poisoned cup. Then Laertes and Hamlet exchange weapons in the heat of the moment. Laertes is also hit by the poisoned sword. The queen dies. Before his death, Laertes tells Hamlet about the murderous intrigues. As soon as Hamlet hears this, he also wounds the king with the sword and forces him to drink of the poisoned wine, reconciling himself with Laertes. Before he himself dies, Hamlet instructs Horatio to report the events to posterity and appoints the young Norwegian king Fortinbras as his successor. Fortinbras orders an honorable military funeral for Hamlet.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="presentation-of-the-play.html" title="Presentation of the play Hamlet" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Presentation of the play</span></a><a href="interpretation.html" title="Interpretation in the play Hamlet" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Interpretation</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The king has died unexpectedly from the effects of a snakebite, and his brother Claudius now sits on the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaudius publicly mourns his brother\u0027s death, but at the same time rejoices in his quick marriage to Gertrude, Hamlet\u0027s mother. Hamlet is shocked and disgusted that his mother has remarried so quickly to his uncle. Unlike the others, he sincerely mourns his father\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne evening, two guards of the castle see a ghost that looks very much like the deceased king. Therefore, they summon Horatio, a friend of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s. He can confirm their statements with his own eyes and then informs Hamlet about the event. Hamlet keeps them company during the next watch and meets the ghost of his father. Prince Hamlet learns from his father\u0026rsquo;s ghost that he was poisoned cold-bloodedly by Claudius while he slept. The ghost demands that Hamlet take revenge on the murderous criminal, but at the same time asks him to spare his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHamlet then decides to pretend to be insane in order to carry out his revenge plan undisturbed, and begins to utter seemingly incoherent and ambiguous sentences. He can confide in no one but his college friend Horatio. His beloved Ophelia has been urged by her brother Laertes and her father Polonius to stay away from him. They do not believe that his vows of love to her were ever sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe chief counselor Polonius thinks that Hamlet\u0027s confusion is caused by his unrequited love for Ophelia. The queen, on the other hand, believes that her son\u0027s bizarre behavior is caused by grief over his father\u0027s death. The king is the only one who suspects something else. He has his advisor Polonius arrange a conversation between Hamlet and Ophelia, which the two then eavesdrop on without success. When Hamlet realizes that Ophelia wants to spy on him, he further pretends to be insane by suddenly rejecting her and asking her to go to a monastery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe suspicious king then orders two childhood friends of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to Denmark to get to the bottom of Hamlet\u0027s alleged madness. However, they do not succeed in winning their old friend\u0026rsquo;s trust. Hamlet immediately guesses that the two have been sent by the king to spy on him. From now on, he sees them only as the new king\u0027s henchmen and no longer trusts them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a group of actors comes to the court, Hamlet seizes the opportunity to check the ghost\u0027s accusations of murder for their accuracy. He asks the company to re-enact the scene of the \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003e\u0026amp;nbsp;murder of a king\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003eregicide \u003c/span\u003ein the play \u0022The Murder of Gonzago.\u0022 If Claudius loses his temper during the play, Hamlet believes he can be sure that Claudius is indeed his father\u0027s murderer. Hamlet is plagued by suicidal thoughts before the performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the poisoning scene is acted, Claudius suddenly leaves the room, agitated. Hamlet is now convinced of his guilt. Claudius then prays for forgiveness for murdering his brother. When Hamlet finds him praying, he plays with the idea of killing him immediately, but then decides against it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the play, Hamlet meets his mother, who tries to bring him back to his senses. The conversation is overheard by Polonius. However, the quarrel between mother and son escalates. When Polonius calls for help for Gertrude, Hamlet kills him with a stab through the curtain, having mistaken him for Claudius. The ghost of the deceased king then appears and reminds Hamlet of his plan for revenge. Since Gertrude cannot see the ghost, she is now even more convinced that her son has fallen prey to madness. Hamlet, however, is able to reassure her that he has not gone mad. He asks her to behave virtuously from now on. The two reconcile and Gertrude promises to keep the conversation secret.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe king suspects that Hamlet has found out the truth about his father\u0027s death and sends him to England together with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Claudius wants to have Hamlet killed there. On the journey to England, however, the suspicious Hamlet discovers Claudius\u0027 death sentence in a secret letter and changes its contents: it no longer demands his execution, but that of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Hamlet returns to Denmark to carry out his revenge against Claudius, while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are killed in England.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLaertes, Ophelia\u0027s brother, returns from his studies in Paris after Polonius\u0027 death. He storms the castle with an angry crowd of soldiers, demanding revenge from Claudius for his father\u0027s murder and unworthy burial. Claudius, however, manages to redirect Laertes\u0027 anger toward Hamlet and convince him that Hamlet is Polonius\u0027 murderer. When they learn that Hamlet is still alive and is returning to Denmark, they plot to make Hamlet\u0027s death in a duel look like an accident: Laertes is to challenge Hamlet to a sporting fencing duel, secretly using a poisoned blade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOphelia, meanwhile, has been driven mad by Hamlet\u0027s rejection and the murder of her father. She is found dead in a river later in the play. When Laertes learns of his sister\u0027s death, he falls into deep mourning. At Ophelia\u0027s funeral, he meets Hamlet, whom he hates. At the open grave, the two engage in a bitter quarrel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaudius arranges a duel between Laertes and Hamlet in the throne room and in the presence of the king and queen.

The queen drinks unsuspectingly from the poisoned cup. Then Laertes and Hamlet exchange weapons in the heat of the moment. Laertes is also hit by the poisoned sword. The queen dies. Before his death, Laertes tells Hamlet about the murderous intrigues. As soon as Hamlet hears this, he also wounds the king with the sword and forces him to drink of the poisoned wine, reconciling himself with Laertes. Before he himself dies, Hamlet instructs Horatio to report the events to posterity and appoints the young Norwegian king Fortinbras as his successor. Fortinbras orders an honorable military funeral for Hamlet.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Summary of Hamlet","MetaDescription":"On the occasion of his father\u0027s death, Prince Hamlet, heir to the throne in the Kingdom of Denmark, returns to Elsinore Castle from his university studies in Wittenberg.
