The main themes are probably <strong>death and revenge</strong>, because it is a tragedy where everyone dies at the end.</p><p>After his father dies, Hamlet promises to revenge his murder. When the ghost of Hamlet Senior tells Hamlet that he was murdered by Claudius, his brother, Hamlet&nbsp;starts to change and pretend that he is crazy to find ways to connect Claudius to the murder. The main external conflict is between Hamlet and Claudius, Hamlet trying to have a revenge on Claudius.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole play involves deaths, and where everyone wants to have a revenge on somebody. Claudius`s plot to kill Hamlet results in death of the most of the characters of the play.</p><p>There are also <strong>love </strong>in the play, between Claudius and Getrude and Hamlet and Ophelia. Gertrude is marrying Claudius only a month after her last husband deceased. Given the social status of the main characters and their behaviour throughout the play&nbsp;we can observe that one of the themes is also politics.</p><p>Shakespeare wants to to tell us that revengefulness is something to avoid. It is something you never want to move yourself towards.

Nor can all the characters in the play, possibly with the exception of Gertrude, suspect at this point that the new king Claudius is basing his rule on a devious <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>the murder of one&rsquo;s brother</p>">fratricide</span>.</p><p>Outwardly, Claudius hypocritically pretends to mourn the death of his brother (1.2.19) and to care wholeheartedly for the well-being of his son, Hamlet: "As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart toward you." (1.2.111-115). In the public talk, it is said that the former king was bitten by a snake in his sleep and died as a result of the poisoning.</p><p>However, at the beginning of the drama, the audience can already suspect that all is not right in Denmark. Already in the first scene, the phantom-like and silent appearance of the ghost indicates that the change of throne has not taken place as peacefully as all of Denmark believes.</p><p>The crown prince Hamlet is apparently the only one who still mourns the death of his father. His mother Gertrude, the wife of the late king, has already willingly married her brother-in-law, Claudius less than two months after the king's death. The hasty remarriage seems extremely suspicious, nut only to Hamlet but also to the audience .</p><p>In fact, what has really happened in the Danish state is revealed to Hamlet and thus to the audience in the first act. The ghost of the deceased king reveals to Hamlet that he has been deceitfully poisoned in his sleep by his brother Claudius and thus deprived "of life, of crown, of queen" (1.5.81). Claudius' supposedly compassionate behavior can now be described as nothing other than the peak of his corrupt hypocrisy.</p><h3 id="heading-0i53x" title="ID: heading-0i53x"><strong>Strategy and lie</strong></h3><p>With the unveiling of the ghost in the first act, there is no doubt that Claudius is a power-driven and corrupt character. Claudius cleverly and deviously planned and brought about the murder of his brother.</p><p>Instead of eliminating his brother directly, Claudius secretly poisons him. Finally, he manages to attribute his brother's death to a snake bite. Thus, he not only obtains the royal crown, but after a few weeks he is also able to win the hand of the now widowed Gertrude.&nbsp;</p><p>After the deceitful Claudius has succeeded in smoothly ascending the throne, he must secure and fortify his power. Therefore, he is anxious to get on good terms with the crown prince Hamlet as well as with Gertrude and the Danish people. To preserve the image of an intact family, he persuades Hamlet to stay in Denmark instead of returning to Wittenberg to continue his studies, and presents himself as a new father figure (1.2.112-120).</p><p>To his servants, he proves to be a gallant and generous ruler. He is also a good strategist: with a clever diplomatic move, he succeeds in preventing a war with Norway (1.2.71-76).</p><h3 id="heading-e6vbu" title="ID: heading-e6vbu"><strong>Surveillance and secret letter</strong></h3><p>When Claudius becomes convinced that his position of power is threatened by Hamlet's suspicious behavior, he resorts to more and more corrupt means to strengthen his position. Without hesitation, he sets Hamlet's childhood friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to spy on Hamlet.</p><p>With the help of the royal counselor Polonius, Claudius also does not hesitate to eavesdrop on a personal conversation between Ophelia and his nephew. As soon as he has the clear suspicion that Hamlet has discovered the true cause of his father's death, he decides without further ado to send him to England as a tribute collector (3.1.177-178).</p><p>Claudius fears Hamlet as a political rival, since he is very "loved by the distracted multitude&rdquo; (4.3.4). The more Claudius feels threatened by Hamlet, the greater his desire to get rid of his nephew for good. When his servant Polonius is accidentally stabbed by Hamlet in the heat of the moment, Claudius immediately recognizes that the attack was actually meant for him: "O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there:" (4.1.13-16).</p><p>In order to defend his threatened power and his life, the clever Claudius again does not rely on direct confrontation, but devises a devious plan. Instead of publicly accusing Hamlet of the death of Polonius and thus casting a scandalous light on the royal house, he hands Rosencrantz and Guildenstern a diplomatic letter in which he urges the King of England to kill Hamlet upon his arrival (4.3.68). By this secret procedure, he would certainly not be personally associated with the death of his nephew abroad. He does everything to preserve his power.</p><h3 id="heading-7ikzb" title="ID: heading-7ikzb"><strong>The last intrigue and the double plan</strong></h3><p>Claudius' plan to have Hamlet killed in England is not successful. Hamlet returns to Denmark and is more dangerous than ever for Claudius. Instead of capturing his nephew himself, Claudius manipulates Laertes, Ophelia's brother, into killing Hamlet in what is supposed to be &ldquo;a fair sporting duel&rdquo;. He himself plans to provide a poisoned cup for his nephew as a precaution in case Laertes fails to wound Hamlet (4.7.174-176).</p><p>Claudius gives two reasons for his devious approach: Gertrude and the Danish people would be too attached to Hamlet if Claudius would publicly reprimand him (4.7.16-24). By making Hamlet's death look like an accident his reputation would not be harmed.&nbsp;</p><p>He once again impressively proves the peak of his unrestrained claim to power. When Gertrude unwittingly reaches for the poisoned cup, he makes only an extremely weak attempt to prevent her from drinking from it. Also, once she drinks the poison, he does not call for help but remains silent, accepting her death so that his murderous intrigues will not be revealed before the court company: "It is the poisoned cup; it is too late" (5.2.290).</p><p>However, Claudius does not carry off a final victory at the end of the drama. He becomes the victim of his own intrigues and his spun web of corruption. Claudius' quest for power and his ruthlessly corrupt and calculating ways may have paved his way to the king's throne, but supernatural forces in the form of the ghost and Hamlet's cleverness ultimately stood in his way.</p><p>After Laertes and Hamlet wound each other, fate turns against the deceitful king. While he is dying, Laertes reveals the king's treacherous murder plan. When Hamlet stabs and poisons Claudius, no member of the court society rushes to the dying king's aid. Claudius' attempt to get Hamlet out of the way behind the scenes ultimately succeeds, but his moral corruption and obsession with power cost him his own life.</p><h2 id="heading-h8ez5" title="ID: heading-h8ez5">Revenge and justice</h2><h3 title="ID: heading-acmkv" id="heading-opsxm"><strong>Hamlet's mission of revenge</strong></h3><p>Revenge is also an important concept in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; by William Shakespeare.</p><p>When Hamlet learns from the ghost of his deceased father that Claudius has murdered him, he resolves from now on to be guided by nothing but the revenge mission set before him: "And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter" (1.5.109)</p><p>The injustice done to his father is particularly treacherous: he was sent to his death "Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd" (1.5.83) and is therefore condemned to stew in purgatory during the day and wander around as a ghost at night. His father's continued misery in the afterlife provides Hamlet with an even greater reason not to reject the demand for vengeance placed upon him. He feels called to restore justice in Denmark: "The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!" (1.5.208).</p><p>Hamlet, however, is a reasonable man; he does not immediately allow his impulsiveness and feelings of revenge to control him. Instead of immediately confronting his uncle Claudius with his father's accusation, he takes it upon himself to first verify his uncle's guilt on his own. He even feigns insanity to be able to investigate without interference. However, his inaction torments him. He curses himself for not pursuing his, for him almost divine, mission with a greater determination: "I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion!" (2.2.569-573)</p><p>Unlike in other Elizabethan revenge dramas, such as "The Spanish Tragedy" by Thomas Kyd, Hamlet does not use the acting performance, the play within the play, to kill the object of his revenge. He merely wants to first obtain definitive proof of the Claudius&rsquo; guilt.</p><p>After the actors perform a fictional play that resembles the murder of Hamlet's father, Hamlet can be certain that Claudius did indeed murder his father. At the very point where the king is murdered in the play, Claudius breaks off the performance with a pale face and leaves the room immediately (3.2.257). Hamlet now has no reason to delay his revenge.</p><h3 id="heading-lkljn" title="ID: heading-lkljn"><strong>Hamlet's hesitation</strong></h3><p>Shortly after the performance, Hamlet finds Claudius alone in prayer and wonders for a long time whether it would be just to murder him at this moment. The scene in which Hamlet hesitates and finally decides against murder can be interpreted in two different ways.</p><p>First, it is possible that Hamlet truly thinks he can avenge his father only if he murders Claudius while he is involved in a more sinful activity. Hamlet, consequently, struggles with the question of how justice can be restored. His own father is condemned to burn in hell because he could not make a final confession before his death.</p><p>For Hamlet, the question now arises whether he has to inflict the same fate on Claudius in order to be fully avenged: "and am I then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No" (3.4.89) He decides to murder Claudius only when he encounters him in an activity that, in all likelihood, will send him directly to hell.</p><p>For a Christian audience, Hamlet might even appear as a wicked and godless avenger who presumes to be able to decide for himself who will go to heaven and who to hell.</p><p>In fact, Hamlet proves to be unusually cruel at this point. So far, he has not even attacked his uncle with words. The fact that now it is not enough for him to kill Claudius, but he also wants to send him directly to hell, hardly seems compatible with his previous character. It is therefore also conceivable that Hamlet at this point cannot yet bring himself to take the life of another person, even if it is his murderous uncle. However, his behavior soon changes.</p><h3 id="heading-uuwmb" title="ID: heading-uuwmb"><strong>Hamlet's revenge without hesitation or remorse</strong></h3><p>Hamlet commits his first murderous act just moments after witnessing Claudius praying. When he notices a person hiding in the room during a heated exchange of words with his mother, he stabs without hesitation because he mistakenly believes this person to be his uncle. He is so angry and furious at this point that he can no longer control himself.</p><p>Hamlet does not feel guilty after killing Polonius. The act cannot stop him from continuing his fierce accusation against Gertrude. When Hamlet's revenge threatens to take too wide a turn, the ghost of his deceased father appears to him again. Although he intensifies his demand for revenge, he also urges Hamlet to show moderation towards his mother (3.4.123).</p><p>Despite the ghost's reproving words, Hamlet's revenge cannot be prevented from taking too wide a turn. When Claudius sends Hamlet to England, he does not object and obediently sails away with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, as soon as he finds the letter in which Claudius demands his execution from the English, he too becomes unpredictable.</p><p>Without hesitation, Hamlet exchanges his name for that of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Although the two had not known the contents of the original letter, Hamlet considers their deaths justified (5.2.62). He returns to Denmark alone. His violent clash with Claudius is now only a matter of time.</p><h3 id="heading-gdew2" title="ID: heading-gdew2"><strong>Retribution and justice</strong></h3><p>"Hamlet" is a revenge tragedy, which tells the story of a young prince who gets involved in a serious revenge mission and in the intrigues of the villain Claudius. He is torn throughout the drama. His emotional outbursts and hesitation give the entire text a profound thoughtfulness. Unlike in other revenge tragedies, Hamlet does not have a concrete plan for revenge even at the end of the drama.</p><p>The duel between Laertes and Hamlet that takes place in the last act is not Hamlet's idea, but Claudius'. Claudius himself initiates the murderous plan, which ultimately goes wrong. When Hamlet and Laertes wound each other with a poisoned dagger, Laertes changes sides at the last second: He tells Hamlet about the king's murderous plot.</p><p>Although Hamlet is already mortally wounded, he still manages to carry out revenge for the death of his father and for the death of his mother, who died as a result of Claudius' poisoning attempt. Hamlet forces Claudius to drink the poisoned wine. This, however, is not the result of an elaborate plan, but that of a rather accidental development and retribution.</p><p>Whether Hamlet's death itself serves justice must be left to the interpretation of the reader. Hamlet has, after all, murdered five members of court who plotted and schemed against him, directly or indirectly, after he himself almost became the victim of two murder plots. However, the fact that the main schemer, the brutal and unscrupulous Claudius, must pay with his life was certainly seen as human justice by many spectators in Elizabethan England.</p><h3 id="heading-oqr6u" title="ID: heading-oqr6u"><strong>Laertes as avenger of his father</strong></h3><p>When Polonius is accidentally stabbed by Hamlet, Laertes is in France. As soon as he hears of his father's death, however, he immediately sets out to avenge him. Unlike Hamlet, he does not investigate the circumstances of the crime or the guilty person. For him, mere rumors and suspicions are enough to move him to action. When he hears that his father has not received an honorable burial, Laertes mistakenly believes Claudius to be his father's murderer.</p><p>For Laertes, his father's death, and above all his honorless burial is a reason to fight violently for his family's honor (4.7.27-31). Without hesitation, he storms the Danish royal castle and confronts Claudius with his accusations. Unlike Hamlet, he has not been summoned to revenge by any supernatural being, but nevertheless has a stronger desire for revenge than Hamlet ever had: "To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged Most thoroughly for my father." (4.5.138)</p><p>Despite his boundless anger, Laertes does not stab the king without talking to him first. He listens to the apparently reasonable arguments and can be convinced by the king that Hamlet is his father's murderer. In order to achieve his revenge against Hamlet, he submits to Claudius' instructions: "My lord, I will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ." (4.7.74).</p><p>From this point on, it is easy for Claudius to manipulate the naive Laertes. He reminds Laertes that the desire for revenge can weaken with time and how important it is therefore to move quickly to action (4.7.135-138). When Claudius proposes to kill Hamlet with a prepared blade in what is supposed to be a sporting fencing match, Laertes agrees to the idea.</p><p>Laertes himself suggests soaking the blade in poison beforehand (4.7.150). Although, according to Elizabethan concepts, he has a right to avenge his father's death, a duel with a manipulated weapon violates the code of honor of the time in a decisive way. If he carries out his plan as described, he makes himself the guilty party.</p><p>The impulsive Laertes, however, sees no other way out. He wants to take revenge on Hamlet as quickly as possible in order to restore his family's honor. However, as he becomes entangled in the deadly duel with Hamlet, he slowly comes to realize how unjust the execution of his blind revenge is. Even during the fight, he says to himself: "And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience." (5.2.295).</p><p>When Hamlet and Laertes finally wound each other, Laertes sees his own death as justified (5.2.330-335). Laertes realizes that he cannot in good conscience murder Hamlet during a dishonorable duel. He reveals the king's murderous plan to Hamlet and asks him for mutual reconciliation: "Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me." (5.2.334-335)</p><h3 id="heading-vilbb" title="ID: heading-vilbb"><strong>Fortinbras as avenger of his father</strong></h3><p>The father-son motif is only relatively briefly touched upon in Fortinbras&rsquo; story, but Fortinbras also clearly feels compelled to avenge his father's death. Hamlet's father and Fortinbras' father once fought in a duel to the death, long before the drama's action. Hamlet's father emerged victorious from the duel and, with his success, immediately received several Norwegian lands as a pledge of victory.</p><p>Unlike Laertes and Hamlet, however, Fortinbras has no reason to take personal revenge. His father was not murdered in an underhanded manner, but died in a fair duel, which was in accordance with the former code of honor and which he himself initiated. He is therefore not responsible for restoring justice.</p><p>At the beginning of the drama, the young Fortinbras strives to regain the former Norwegian lands. His action is consequently not directed against one person, but politically against all of Denmark. The Norwegian prince has not tried to take revenge on old Hamlet, but has waited patiently and cleverly for Denmark to stand politically weakened. As soon as the former ruler has died, he arms his troops against the Denmark of the new king Claudius (1.2.11-40)</p><p>When Claudius, in a clever diplomatic move, sends a message to Fortinbras' uncle informing him of his nephew's doings, Fortinbras is threatened with arrest in Norway (2.2.70-75). Fortinbras is obviously not involved in any deep thoughts of revenge; he immediately vows never again to go to war against the king of the Danes.</p><p>Fortinbras wisely abandons his plan on going against Denmark and is richly rewarded because of this. Hamlet admires and respects Fortinbras for his courage, therefore he chooses him to take the Danish throne at the end of the drama. (5.2.362-365). This respect is mutual: Fortinbras orders Hamlet to be buried with all military honors.</p><h2 id="heading-dwglj" title="ID: heading-dwglj">"Hamlet" as a love story</h2><h3 title="ID: heading-7idfi" id="heading-1fwtq"><strong>Ophelia's love</strong></h3><p>Due to the fact that the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia occupies a central place within the drama plot, "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare can also be read to some extent as a love story. However, it lacks central components of this genre. Their first acquaintance, their first advances, and their first, if any, erotic contacts are not addressed.</p><p>At the beginning of the drama, Ophelia is still convinced that she is really loved by the prince of the throne: "My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion. (...) And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven." (1.3.118). However, the viewer does not learn any more details about this described relationship. Polonius orders his daughter not to believe Hamlet's oaths and instructs her to distance herself from him. His obedient daughter does not object to this demand.</p><h3 id="heading-qxnvz" title="ID: heading-qxnvz"><strong>Hamlet's rejection</strong></h3><p>In a stereotypical love story, Hamlet might now be expected to try at all costs to win back the trust of his beloved and also to convince her father of his fidelity. But Hamlet has meanwhile developed his own plans: He wants to play a madman at court in order to be able to make undercover plans of investigation and revenge against Claudius. His relationship with Ophelia is not so intimate and familiar that he can share his secret with her.</p><p>The naive Ophelia does not recognize Hamlet's deception. She is first horrified and alarmed by his new behavior and finally hopelessly distressed. When Hamlet claims never to have loved her and urges her to retire to a monastery (3.1.145), she is plunged into deep grief and despair: "O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! (...) And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, (...) O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!" (3.1.158-169).</p><p>At first glance, at the latest in the third act, it really does seem as if the love between Hamlet and Ophelia had long since passed its peak and the drama no longer deserved the title "love story". After Ophelia's death, however, the audience learns that Hamlet misses Ophelia: "Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that." (5.1.169-175)</p><h3 id="heading-tewks" title="ID: heading-tewks"><strong>Hamlet's love</strong></h3><p>Hamlet has loved Ophelia all along, but he does not declare his feelings until her funeral: He loses his temper, wrestles with Laertes on her grave, and proclaims before the assembled court company, "I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum." (5.1.256-258).</p><p>Through Hamlet's confession it becomes obvious that he distanced himself from her for strategic reasons, to spare her: He did not want her to become involved in Claudius' courtly and brutal intrigues. His plan fails, however, and Ophelia dies tragically without knowing that Hamlet actually loved her.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/hamlet/interpretation" title="Interpretation in the play Hamlet" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Interpretation</span></a><a href="/hamlet/analysis" title="Analysis of Hamlet" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Analysis</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Nor can all the characters in the play, possibly with the exception of Gertrude, suspect at this point that the new king Claudius is basing his rule on a devious \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u003cp\u003ethe murder of one\u0026rsquo;s brother\u003c/p\u003e\u0022\u003efratricide\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutwardly, Claudius hypocritically pretends to mourn the death of his brother (1.2.19) and to care wholeheartedly for the well-being of his son, Hamlet: \u0022As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart toward you.\u0022 (1.2.111-115). In the public talk, it is said that the former king was bitten by a snake in his sleep and died as a result of the poisoning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, at the beginning of the drama, the audience can already suspect that all is not right in Denmark. Already in the first scene, the phantom-like and silent appearance of the ghost indicates that the change of throne has not taken place as peacefully as all of Denmark believes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crown prince Hamlet is apparently the only one who still mourns the death of his father. His mother Gertrude, the wife of the late king, has already willingly married her brother-in-law, Claudius less than two months after the king\u0027s death. The hasty remarriage seems extremely suspicious, nut only to Hamlet but also to the audience .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, what has really happened in the Danish state is revealed to Hamlet and thus to the audience in the first act. The ghost of the deceased king reveals to Hamlet that he has been deceitfully poisoned in his sleep by his brother Claudius and thus deprived \u0022of life, of crown, of queen\u0022 (1.5.81). Claudius\u0027 supposedly compassionate behavior can now be described as nothing other than the peak of his corrupt hypocrisy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-0i53x\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-0i53x\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrategy and lie\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the unveiling of the ghost in the first act, there is no doubt that Claudius is a power-driven and corrupt character. Claudius cleverly and deviously planned and brought about the murder of his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of eliminating his brother directly, Claudius secretly poisons him. Finally, he manages to attribute his brother\u0027s death to a snake bite. Thus, he not only obtains the royal crown, but after a few weeks he is also able to win the hand of the now widowed Gertrude.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the deceitful Claudius has succeeded in smoothly ascending the throne, he must secure and fortify his power. Therefore, he is anxious to get on good terms with the crown prince Hamlet as well as with Gertrude and the Danish people. To preserve the image of an intact family, he persuades Hamlet to stay in Denmark instead of returning to Wittenberg to continue his studies, and presents himself as a new father figure (1.2.112-120).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo his servants, he proves to be a gallant and generous ruler. He is also a good strategist: with a clever diplomatic move, he succeeds in preventing a war with Norway (1.2.71-76).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-e6vbu\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-e6vbu\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSurveillance and secret letter\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Claudius becomes convinced that his position of power is threatened by Hamlet\u0027s suspicious behavior, he resorts to more and more corrupt means to strengthen his position. Without hesitation, he sets Hamlet\u0027s childhood friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to spy on Hamlet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the help of the royal counselor Polonius, Claudius also does not hesitate to eavesdrop on a personal conversation between Ophelia and his nephew. As soon as he has the clear suspicion that Hamlet has discovered the true cause of his father\u0027s death, he decides without further ado to send him to England as a tribute collector (3.1.177-178).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaudius fears Hamlet as a political rival, since he is very \u0022loved by the distracted multitude\u0026rdquo; (4.3.4). The more Claudius feels threatened by Hamlet, the greater his desire to get rid of his nephew for good. When his servant Polonius is accidentally stabbed by Hamlet in the heat of the moment, Claudius immediately recognizes that the attack was actually meant for him: \u0022O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there:\u0022 (4.1.13-16).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to defend his threatened power and his life, the clever Claudius again does not rely on direct confrontation, but devises a devious plan. Instead of publicly accusing Hamlet of the death of Polonius and thus casting a scandalous light on the royal house, he hands Rosencrantz and Guildenstern a diplomatic letter in which he urges the King of England to kill Hamlet upon his arrival (4.3.68). By this secret procedure, he would certainly not be personally associated with the death of his nephew abroad. He does everything to preserve his power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-7ikzb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-7ikzb\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe last intrigue and the double plan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaudius\u0027 plan to have Hamlet killed in England is not successful. Hamlet returns to Denmark and is more dangerous than ever for Claudius. Instead of capturing his nephew himself, Claudius manipulates Laertes, Ophelia\u0027s brother, into killing Hamlet in what is supposed to be \u0026ldquo;a fair sporting duel\u0026rdquo;. He himself plans to provide a poisoned cup for his nephew as a precaution in case Laertes fails to wound Hamlet (4.7.174-176).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaudius gives two reasons for his devious approach: Gertrude and the Danish people would be too attached to Hamlet if Claudius would publicly reprimand him (4.7.16-24). By making Hamlet\u0027s death look like an accident his reputation would not be harmed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe once again impressively proves the peak of his unrestrained claim to power. When Gertrude unwittingly reaches for the poisoned cup, he makes only an extremely weak attempt to prevent her from drinking from it. Also, once she drinks the poison, he does not call for help but remains silent, accepting her death so that his murderous intrigues will not be revealed before the court company: \u0022It is the poisoned cup; it is too late\u0022 (5.2.290).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Claudius does not carry off a final victory at the end of the drama. He becomes the victim of his own intrigues and his spun web of corruption. Claudius\u0027 quest for power and his ruthlessly corrupt and calculating ways may have paved his way to the king\u0027s throne, but supernatural forces in the form of the ghost and Hamlet\u0027s cleverness ultimately stood in his way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Laertes and Hamlet wound each other, fate turns against the deceitful king. While he is dying, Laertes reveals the king\u0027s treacherous murder plan. When Hamlet stabs and poisons Claudius, no member of the court society rushes to the dying king\u0027s aid. Claudius\u0027 attempt to get Hamlet out of the way behind the scenes ultimately succeeds, but his moral corruption and obsession with power cost him his own life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-h8ez5\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-h8ez5\u0022\u003eRevenge and justice\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 title=\u0022ID: heading-acmkv\u0022 id=\u0022heading-opsxm\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHamlet\u0027s mission of revenge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevenge is also an important concept in \u0026ldquo;Hamlet\u0026rdquo; by William Shakespeare.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Hamlet learns from the ghost of his deceased father that Claudius has murdered him, he resolves from now on to be guided by nothing but the revenge mission set before him: \u0022And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix\u0027d with baser matter\u0022 (1.5.109)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe injustice done to his father is particularly treacherous: he was sent to his death \u0022Unhousel\u0027d, disappointed, unanel\u0027d\u0022 (1.5.83) and is therefore condemned to stew in purgatory during the day and wander around as a ghost at night. His father\u0027s continued misery in the afterlife provides Hamlet with an even greater reason not to reject the demand for vengeance placed upon him. He feels called to restore justice in Denmark: \u0022The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!\u0022 (1.5.208).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHamlet, however, is a reasonable man; he does not immediately allow his impulsiveness and feelings of revenge to control him. Instead of immediately confronting his uncle Claudius with his father\u0027s accusation, he takes it upon himself to first verify his uncle\u0027s guilt on his own. He even feigns insanity to be able to investigate without interference. However, his inaction torments him. He curses himself for not pursuing his, for him almost divine, mission with a greater determination: \u0022I, the son of a dear father murder\u0027d, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion!\u0022 (2.2.569-573)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike in other Elizabethan revenge dramas, such as \u0022The Spanish Tragedy\u0022 by Thomas Kyd, Hamlet does not use the acting performance, the play within the play, to kill the object of his revenge. He merely wants to first obtain definitive proof of the Claudius\u0026rsquo; guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the actors perform a fictional play that resembles the murder of Hamlet\u0027s father, Hamlet can be certain that Claudius did indeed murder his father. At the very point where the king is murdered in the play, Claudius breaks off the performance with a pale face and leaves the room immediately (3.2.257). Hamlet now has no reason to delay his revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-lkljn\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-lkljn\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHamlet\u0027s hesitation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after the performance, Hamlet finds Claudius alone in prayer and wonders for a long time whether it would be just to murder him at this moment. The scene in which Hamlet hesitates and finally decides against murder can be interpreted in two different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, it is possible that Hamlet truly thinks he can avenge his father only if he murders Claudius while he is involved in a more sinful activity. Hamlet, consequently, struggles with the question of how justice can be restored. His own father is condemned to burn in hell because he could not make a final confession before his death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Hamlet, the question now arises whether he has to inflict the same fate on Claudius in order to be fully avenged: \u0022and am I then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season\u0027d for his passage? No\u0022 (3.4.89) He decides to murder Claudius only when he encounters him in an activity that, in all likelihood, will send him directly to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a Christian audience, Hamlet might even appear as a wicked and godless avenger who presumes to be able to decide for himself who will go to heaven and who to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Hamlet proves to be unusually cruel at this point. So far, he has not even attacked his uncle with words. The fact that now it is not enough for him to kill Claudius, but he also wants to send him directly to hell, hardly seems compatible with his previous character. It is therefore also conceivable that Hamlet at this point cannot yet bring himself to take the life of another person, even if it is his murderous uncle. However, his behavior soon changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-uuwmb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-uuwmb\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHamlet\u0027s revenge without hesitation or remorse\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHamlet commits his first murderous act just moments after witnessing Claudius praying. When he notices a person hiding in the room during a heated exchange of words with his mother, he stabs without hesitation because he mistakenly believes this person to be his uncle. He is so angry and furious at this point that he can no longer control himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHamlet does not feel guilty after killing Polonius. The act cannot stop him from continuing his fierce accusation against Gertrude. When Hamlet\u0027s revenge threatens to take too wide a turn, the ghost of his deceased father appears to him again. Although he intensifies his demand for revenge, he also urges Hamlet to show moderation towards his mother (3.4.123).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the ghost\u0027s reproving words, Hamlet\u0027s revenge cannot be prevented from taking too wide a turn. When Claudius sends Hamlet to England, he does not object and obediently sails away with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, as soon as he finds the letter in which Claudius demands his execution from the English, he too becomes unpredictable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, Hamlet exchanges his name for that of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Although the two had not known the contents of the original letter, Hamlet considers their deaths justified (5.2.62). He returns to Denmark alone. His violent clash with Claudius is now only a matter of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-gdew2\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-gdew2\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRetribution and justice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0022Hamlet\u0022 is a revenge tragedy, which tells the story of a young prince who gets involved in a serious revenge mission and in the intrigues of the villain Claudius. He is torn throughout the drama. His emotional outbursts and hesitation give the entire text a profound thoughtfulness. Unlike in other revenge tragedies, Hamlet does not have a concrete plan for revenge even at the end of the drama.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe duel between Laertes and Hamlet that takes place in the last act is not Hamlet\u0027s idea, but Claudius\u0027. Claudius himself initiates the murderous plan, which ultimately goes wrong. When Hamlet and Laertes wound each other with a poisoned dagger, Laertes changes sides at the last second: He tells Hamlet about the king\u0027s murderous plot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Hamlet is already mortally wounded, he still manages to carry out revenge for the death of his father and for the death of his mother, who died as a result of Claudius\u0027 poisoning attempt. Hamlet forces Claudius to drink the poisoned wine. This, however, is not the result of an elaborate plan, but that of a rather accidental development and retribution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether Hamlet\u0027s death itself serves justice must be left to the interpretation of the reader. Hamlet has, after all, murdered five members of court who plotted and schemed against him, directly or indirectly, after he himself almost became the victim of two murder plots. However, the fact that the main schemer, the brutal and unscrupulous Claudius, must pay with his life was certainly seen as human justice by many spectators in Elizabethan England.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-oqr6u\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-oqr6u\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaertes as avenger of his father\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Polonius is accidentally stabbed by Hamlet, Laertes is in France. As soon as he hears of his father\u0027s death, however, he immediately sets out to avenge him. Unlike Hamlet, he does not investigate the circumstances of the crime or the guilty person. For him, mere rumors and suspicions are enough to move him to action. When he hears that his father has not received an honorable burial, Laertes mistakenly believes Claudius to be his father\u0027s murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Laertes, his father\u0027s death, and above all his honorless burial is a reason to fight violently for his family\u0027s honor (4.7.27-31). Without hesitation, he storms the Danish royal castle and confronts Claudius with his accusations. Unlike Hamlet, he has not been summoned to revenge by any supernatural being, but nevertheless has a stronger desire for revenge than Hamlet ever had: \u0022To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I\u0027ll be revenged Most thoroughly for my father.\u0022 (4.5.138)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite his boundless anger, Laertes does not stab the king without talking to him first. He listens to the apparently reasonable arguments and can be convinced by the king that Hamlet is his father\u0027s murderer. In order to achieve his revenge against Hamlet, he submits to Claudius\u0027 instructions: \u0022My lord, I will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.\u0022 (4.7.74).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom this point on, it is easy for Claudius to manipulate the naive Laertes. He reminds Laertes that the desire for revenge can weaken with time and how important it is therefore to move quickly to action (4.7.135-138). When Claudius proposes to kill Hamlet with a prepared blade in what is supposed to be a sporting fencing match, Laertes agrees to the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLaertes himself suggests soaking the blade in poison beforehand (4.7.150). Although, according to Elizabethan concepts, he has a right to avenge his father\u0027s death, a duel with a manipulated weapon violates the code of honor of the time in a decisive way. If he carries out his plan as described, he makes himself the guilty party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe impulsive Laertes, however, sees no other way out. He wants to take revenge on Hamlet as quickly as possible in order to restore his family\u0027s honor. However, as he becomes entangled in the deadly duel with Hamlet, he slowly comes to realize how unjust the execution of his blind revenge is. Even during the fight, he says to himself: \u0022And yet \u0027tis almost \u0027gainst my conscience.\u0022 (5.2.295).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Hamlet and Laertes finally wound each other, Laertes sees his own death as justified (5.2.330-335). Laertes realizes that he cannot in good conscience murder Hamlet during a dishonorable duel. He reveals the king\u0027s murderous plan to Hamlet and asks him for mutual reconciliation: \u0022Mine and my father\u0027s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.\u0022 (5.2.334-335)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-vilbb\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-vilbb\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFortinbras as avenger of his father\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe father-son motif is only relatively briefly touched upon in Fortinbras\u0026rsquo; story, but Fortinbras also clearly feels compelled to avenge his father\u0027s death. Hamlet\u0027s father and Fortinbras\u0027 father once fought in a duel to the death, long before the drama\u0027s action. Hamlet\u0027s father emerged victorious from the duel and, with his success, immediately received several Norwegian lands as a pledge of victory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike Laertes and Hamlet, however, Fortinbras has no reason to take personal revenge. His father was not murdered in an underhanded manner, but died in a fair duel, which was in accordance with the former code of honor and which he himself initiated. He is therefore not responsible for restoring justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of the drama, the young Fortinbras strives to regain the former Norwegian lands. His action is consequently not directed against one person, but politically against all of Denmark. The Norwegian prince has not tried to take revenge on old Hamlet, but has waited patiently and cleverly for Denmark to stand politically weakened. As soon as the former ruler has died, he arms his troops against the Denmark of the new king Claudius (1.2.11-40)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Claudius, in a clever diplomatic move, sends a message to Fortinbras\u0027 uncle informing him of his nephew\u0027s doings, Fortinbras is threatened with arrest in Norway (2.2.70-75). Fortinbras is obviously not involved in any deep thoughts of revenge; he immediately vows never again to go to war against the king of the Danes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortinbras wisely abandons his plan on going against Denmark and is richly rewarded because of this. Hamlet admires and respects Fortinbras for his courage, therefore he chooses him to take the Danish throne at the end of the drama. (5.2.362-365). This respect is mutual: Fortinbras orders Hamlet to be buried with all military honors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-dwglj\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-dwglj\u0022\u003e\u0022Hamlet\u0022 as a love story\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 title=\u0022ID: heading-7idfi\u0022 id=\u0022heading-1fwtq\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOphelia\u0027s love\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDue to the fact that the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia occupies a central place within the drama plot, \u0022Hamlet\u0022 by William Shakespeare can also be read to some extent as a love story. However, it lacks central components of this genre. Their first acquaintance, their first advances, and their first, if any, erotic contacts are not addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of the drama, Ophelia is still convinced that she is really loved by the prince of the throne: \u0022My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion. (...) And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.\u0022 (1.3.118). However, the viewer does not learn any more details about this described relationship. Polonius orders his daughter not to believe Hamlet\u0027s oaths and instructs her to distance herself from him. His obedient daughter does not object to this demand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-qxnvz\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-qxnvz\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHamlet\u0027s rejection\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a stereotypical love story, Hamlet might now be expected to try at all costs to win back the trust of his beloved and also to convince her father of his fidelity. But Hamlet has meanwhile developed his own plans: He wants to play a madman at court in order to be able to make undercover plans of investigation and revenge against Claudius. His relationship with Ophelia is not so intimate and familiar that he can share his secret with her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe naive Ophelia does not recognize Hamlet\u0027s deception. She is first horrified and alarmed by his new behavior and finally hopelessly distressed. When Hamlet claims never to have loved her and urges her to retire to a monastery (3.1.145), she is plunged into deep grief and despair: \u0022O, what a noble mind is here o\u0027erthrown! (...) And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, (...) O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\u0022 (3.1.158-169).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, at the latest in the third act, it really does seem as if the love between Hamlet and Ophelia had long since passed its peak and the drama no longer deserved the title \u0022love story\u0022. After Ophelia\u0027s death, however, the audience learns that Hamlet misses Ophelia: \u0022Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady\u0027s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that.\u0022 (5.1.169-175)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-tewks\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-tewks\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHamlet\u0027s love\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHamlet has loved Ophelia all along, but he does not declare his feelings until her funeral: He loses his temper, wrestles with Laertes on her grave, and proclaims before the assembled court company, \u0022I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.\u0022 (5.1.256-258).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough Hamlet\u0027s confession it becomes obvious that he distanced himself from her for strategic reasons, to spare her: He did not want her to become involved in Claudius\u0027 courtly and brutal intrigues. His plan fails, however, and Ophelia dies tragically without knowing that Hamlet actually loved her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Themes of Hamlet","MetaDescription":"There are several themes throughout the play, and some of these are death, insanity and revenge.
