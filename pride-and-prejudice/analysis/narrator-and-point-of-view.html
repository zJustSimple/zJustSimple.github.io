Very often, throughout the novel, we know what Elizabeth is thinking and how she perceives different events. Here is one&nbsp;example:</p><blockquote><p>Elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. (p. 32)</p></blockquote><p>As mentioned, an omniscient narrator can theoretically access the minds of all characters, which we see in this passage where we get to go inside Darcy head:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. (p. 15)</p></blockquote><p>The narrator also&nbsp;explains Charlotte&rsquo;s attempt to pursue Mr Collins before Elizabeth knows about it (p. 86) and gives us&nbsp;snippets of the point of view of other characters, including that of&nbsp;Jane (p. 60) or Mr&nbsp;Bennet (p. 48).</p><p>The narrator&rsquo;s omniscience is also suggested through certain descriptive passages that suggest <strong>a bird&rsquo;s eye view</strong> &ndash; that the narrator knows what happens to all the characters at the same time, what has happened to them in the opast, and what will happen to them in the future. In Chapter 1, for example, the narrator expresses some wider ideas that will be relevant for the development of the plot&nbsp;and explains the point of view of the general community:</p><blockquote><p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of someone or other of their daughters. (p. 1)</p></blockquote><p>The last paragraph of Chapter 1 also suggests the narrator&rsquo;s omniscience, as it gives insight into the characters of the Bennet family:</p><blockquote><p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was the less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. (p. 3)</p></blockquote><p>This quote also shows us that this is <strong>an omniscient narrator with a personality</strong>. The description of Mrs Bennet is not kind since she is portrayed as a rather stupid woman. Genrally, the narrator's tone of voice in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is like this - full of sarcasm, irony, and a wry sense of humour.</p><p>The narrator is also <strong>completely in control </strong>of when we get to access whose thoughts. As readers, we are only given specific details where the narrator deems them relevant. Furthermore, the narrator moves our attention to Elizabeth gradually and moves the narrative focus away from other characters. For example, in the first chapters, a lot of attention seems to be given to Jane. However, when Jane recovers from the cold that kept her at Netherfield Park and joins the group there one evening, the narrator keeps the focus on Elizabeth and her conversations.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="285253c7-dc42-470d-bfa4-a503b9bc80af">Narrative techniques</h2><p>The narrator uses various techniques to convey the plot to us. A lot of the action is conveyed through dialogue and free indirect speech.</p><p>Jane Austen is famous for her skills at writing good <strong>dialogue</strong>. The use of dialogue helps the narrator show us what is going on in a more lively way than if we were to have it all told&nbsp;to us directly by the narrator.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>As readers, we see the conversations between the characters, which allows us to draw our own conclusions about their personalities. In Chapter 1, for example, we see Mr and Mrs Bennet talking with minor (ironical) interventions from the narrator, setting the scene and characterisation:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Do you not want to know who has taken it?&rsquo; cried his wife impatiently.<br />&lsquo;You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&rsquo;<br />This was invitation enough. (p. 3)</p></blockquote><p>Nevertheless, there are also passages in which the narrator chooses <strong>the telling technique</strong>. Here is an example of narration when we are told what is happening: &ldquo;An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.&rdquo; (p. 5).</p><p><strong>Free indirect speech</strong> means that a character&rsquo;s thoughts are conveyed without any quotation marks (as with dialogue) or without stating explicitly that these are their thoughts. One relevant example is when Wickham&rsquo;s attitude seems to be described by the narrator, but the description&nbsp;actually represents Elizabeth&rsquo;s thoughts about him:</p><blockquote><p>Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. (p. 59)</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, although the whole novel is written in the third-person, at the end of the book,&nbsp;<strong>the narrator switches to the first-person</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life.&nbsp;(p. 270)</p></blockquote><p>This introduces a moment of connection between the reader and the narrator, and suggests that the characters in the novel have a life beyond the pages of the book.</p><p>Another time when we feel the narrator getting&nbsp;more personal is when something resembling<strong> direct address to the readers </strong>is used:</p><blockquote><p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. (p. 167)</p></blockquote><p>We&nbsp;can almost feel the narrator&nbsp;addressing the readers.</p><p><strong>Letters</strong> play an important role in the narrative as well. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> was one of the first novels to use letters to convey important elements of the plot. Such is the case with Darcy&rsquo;s letter to Elizabeth which reveals Wickham&rsquo;s behaviour: &ldquo;He so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement&rdquo; (p. 141). Darcy&rsquo;s letter takes up about 5 pages of the narrative (pp. 137-142), and we feel that <strong>he takes over as narrator</strong>&nbsp;for a while.

Very often, throughout the novel, we know what Elizabeth is thinking and how she perceives different events. Here is one\u0026nbsp;example:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. (p. 32)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, an omniscient narrator can theoretically access the minds of all characters, which we see in this passage where we get to go inside Darcy head:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. (p. 15)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator also\u0026nbsp;explains Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s attempt to pursue Mr Collins before Elizabeth knows about it (p. 86) and gives us\u0026nbsp;snippets of the point of view of other characters, including that of\u0026nbsp;Jane (p. 60) or Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet (p. 48).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator\u0026rsquo;s omniscience is also suggested through certain descriptive passages that suggest \u003cstrong\u003ea bird\u0026rsquo;s eye view\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; that the narrator knows what happens to all the characters at the same time, what has happened to them in the opast, and what will happen to them in the future. In Chapter 1, for example, the narrator expresses some wider ideas that will be relevant for the development of the plot\u0026nbsp;and explains the point of view of the general community:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of someone or other of their daughters. (p. 1)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last paragraph of Chapter 1 also suggests the narrator\u0026rsquo;s omniscience, as it gives insight into the characters of the Bennet family:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was the less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. (p. 3)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis quote also shows us that this is \u003cstrong\u003ean omniscient narrator with a personality\u003c/strong\u003e. The description of Mrs Bennet is not kind since she is portrayed as a rather stupid woman. Genrally, the narrator\u0027s tone of voice in \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e is like this - full of sarcasm, irony, and a wry sense of humour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator is also \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely in control \u003c/strong\u003eof when we get to access whose thoughts. As readers, we are only given specific details where the narrator deems them relevant. Furthermore, the narrator moves our attention to Elizabeth gradually and moves the narrative focus away from other characters. For example, in the first chapters, a lot of attention seems to be given to Jane. However, when Jane recovers from the cold that kept her at Netherfield Park and joins the group there one evening, the narrator keeps the focus on Elizabeth and her conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022285253c7-dc42-470d-bfa4-a503b9bc80af\u0022\u003eNarrative techniques\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator uses various techniques to convey the plot to us. A lot of the action is conveyed through dialogue and free indirect speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane Austen is famous for her skills at writing good \u003cstrong\u003edialogue\u003c/strong\u003e. The use of dialogue helps the narrator show us what is going on in a more lively way than if we were to have it all told\u0026nbsp;to us directly by the narrator.\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAs readers, we see the conversations between the characters, which allows us to draw our own conclusions about their personalities. In Chapter 1, for example, we see Mr and Mrs Bennet talking with minor (ironical) interventions from the narrator, setting the scene and characterisation:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Do you not want to know who has taken it?\u0026rsquo; cried his wife impatiently.\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026lsquo;You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u0026rsquo;\u003cbr /\u003eThis was invitation enough. (p. 3)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, there are also passages in which the narrator chooses \u003cstrong\u003ethe telling technique\u003c/strong\u003e. Here is an example of narration when we are told what is happening: \u0026ldquo;An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.\u0026rdquo; (p. 5).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree indirect speech\u003c/strong\u003e means that a character\u0026rsquo;s thoughts are conveyed without any quotation marks (as with dialogue) or without stating explicitly that these are their thoughts. One relevant example is when Wickham\u0026rsquo;s attitude seems to be described by the narrator, but the description\u0026nbsp;actually represents Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s thoughts about him:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u0027s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\u0027s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. (p. 59)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, although the whole novel is written in the third-person, at the end of the book,\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ethe narrator switches to the first-person\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life.\u0026nbsp;(p. 270)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis introduces a moment of connection between the reader and the narrator, and suggests that the characters in the novel have a life beyond the pages of the book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother time when we feel the narrator getting\u0026nbsp;more personal is when something resembling\u003cstrong\u003e direct address to the readers \u003c/strong\u003eis used:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. (p. 167)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026nbsp;can almost feel the narrator\u0026nbsp;addressing the readers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLetters\u003c/strong\u003e play an important role in the narrative as well. \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e was one of the first novels to use letters to convey important elements of the plot. Such is the case with Darcy\u0026rsquo;s letter to Elizabeth which reveals Wickham\u0026rsquo;s behaviour: \u0026ldquo;He so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement\u0026rdquo; (p. 141). Darcy\u0026rsquo;s letter takes up about 5 pages of the narrative (pp. 137-142), and we feel that \u003cstrong\u003ehe takes over as narrator\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;for a while. Other relevant examples of letters are those exchanged between Lizzie and Jane, or between Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins and Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Narrator and point of view of Pride and Prejudice","MetaDescription":"Jane Austen’s novel Pride and Prejudice is constructed with a third-person omniscient narrator, as we often see in old novels.
