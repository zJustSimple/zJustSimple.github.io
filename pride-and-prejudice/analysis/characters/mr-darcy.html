He is 28 years old (p. 259),&nbsp;has a sister, Georgiana, and his parents have died (p. 141).</p><p>He is also the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and is intended to marry her daughter.&nbsp;However, by the end of the novel, he marries the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. He is also a close friend&nbsp;of another key character, Charles Bingley, and the cousin of Colonel&nbsp;Fitzwilliam.</p><p>A few details are offered about his physical traits, suggesting he is <strong>a good-looking man:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien [...]&nbsp;The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley. (p. 6)</p></blockquote><p>In another excerpt, we see Darcy from Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s point of view: &ldquo;He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 178).</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="ebd56847-fa50-4159-b542-19d17d77508c">Inner characterisation</h2><p>Darcy&rsquo;s inner characterisation is constructed both directly by the narrator and other characters and indirectly through his speech, actions, thoughts, and attitudes.</p><p>In the beginning of the novel, Darcy comes across as being <strong>disagreeable</strong>, because he is very <strong>aware of class differences</strong> and his superior social status. This makes him <strong>seem vain and proud</strong>. As a wealthy aristocrat with a cold attitude, Darcy makes everyone in Meryton dislike him: &ldquo;Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.&rdquo; (p. 10). For example, during the first ball, Darcy argues that &ldquo;Every savage can dance&rdquo; (p. 17), showing his snobbish contempt for the happy village people dancing.</p><p>He is <strong>uncomfortable in social situations</strong> except amongst his close friends. He later tells Elizabeth that he is &ldquo;ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers&rdquo; (p. 123). He goes on to say:&nbsp;&ldquo;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess [...]&nbsp;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done&rdquo; (p. 123). This also shows that Darcy is aware of at least some of his failings.</p><p><strong>At first, he is not attracted to Elizabeth</strong>, refusing to invite her to dance: &ldquo;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt <em>me</em>; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.&rdquo; (p. 7). However, as the story progresses, he becomes attracted to her despite his reason.&nbsp;Darcy finds himself in an awkward position because he increasingly likes Elizabeth while also resenting her family&rsquo;s low social status and lack of manners:</p><blockquote><p>Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.&nbsp;(p. 15)</p></blockquote><p>Consequently, he continues to act unkindly towards her, making her resent him even more. His attitude towards her is <strong><span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;A snob is someone who has an exaggerated respect for higher social status and disregards those of lower status.&lt;/p&gt;">snobbish and he hides behind his rationality</span></strong>:&nbsp;&ldquo;Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.&rdquo; (p. 36).&nbsp;Darcy disregards Elizabeth&rsquo;s family because of their lower social status and therefore considers a marriage to her unrealistic. After a few interactions, Elizabeth is convinced that his &ldquo;unforgiving temper&rdquo; (p. 57) makes him a<strong> &ldquo;dreadful&rdquo;</strong> (p. 57) person.</p><p>Arguing that Jane is indifferent to Bingley, Darcy&nbsp;persuades Bingley to leave Netherfield. He is a very <strong>loyal and protective friend</strong>, but his attitude also suggests that he is <strong>arrogant</strong> and believes he knows better than his friend. He later tells Elizabeth that his decision was based on impartial observation, suggesting that he (like Elizabeth) <strong>prides himself on his perceptivity</strong> (p. 10,&nbsp;p. 130).</p><p>When Darcy and Elizabeth meet again at the estate of his aunt, Lady Catherine, their interactions there make him <strong>accept that he is in love with her</strong>: &ldquo;In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.&rdquo; (p. 132). Despite his prejudices, he asks her to marry him, rationally explaining his objections to her family and social status&nbsp;but claiming he will ignore them. When Elizabeth becomes offended and bluntly refuses him while also accusing&nbsp;him of mistreating Wickham and of separating Bingley and Jane, Darcy is shocked. He absolutely expected Elizabeth to accept his proposal, indicating his <strong>arrogance and lack of perceptivity towards her feelings</strong>: &ldquo;As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He <em>spoke</em> of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security&rdquo; (p. 133). His pride receives a severe blow when she refuses him, and he is takes his leave with a sarcastic reply:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.&rsquo; (p. 135)</p></blockquote><p>However, upon reflection, Darcy writes Elizabeth a long letter, addressing her accusations and explaining his actions. The letter is <strong>polite and rational</strong>, but Darcy later explains his feelings: &ldquo;When I wrote that letter [...]&nbsp;I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit&rdquo; (p. 258). This shows that Darcy did not understand himself or his own feelings up until Elizabeth&rsquo;s rejection of him. We get the feeling that Darcy is used to being a rational man in control of himself. When he falls deeply in love with Elizabeth (who does not want him), he is at a loss. However, her brutal rejection of him is <strong>a turning point for his character</strong>, a reality check, and he then begins to be perceptive about himself and others. When Elizabeth eventually&nbsp;accepts his proposal in the ending, he explains this more fully:</p><blockquote><p>I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. (p. 259)</p></blockquote><p>Already when the two of them meet again at Darcy&rsquo;s estate, we see that Darcy <strong>is making&nbsp;an effort to act in a kinder and more sociable way</strong>.<strong> </strong>He is polite towards Elizabeth&rsquo;s relatives and introduces her to his sister, suggesting that he is eager to compensate for his previously arrogant behaviour.</p><p>Darcy also makes amends for his previous attitude in&nbsp;the episode with Lydia and Wickham. Because he <strong>feels responsible for not exposing Wickham&rsquo;s character</strong> in the past, Darcy intervenes in the affair and convinces Wickham&nbsp;to marry Lydia in exchange for paying his gambling debts (pp. 226-227).</p><p>Encouraged by the fact that Elizabeth refused to promise his aunt not to marry him, he repeats&nbsp;his marriage proposal &ndash; which Elizabeth accepts this time: &ldquo;You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.&nbsp;My&nbsp;affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.&rdquo; (p. 256). This also shows <strong>Darcy&rsquo;s courage</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and strong feelings for Elizabeth</strong> as he acts against his domineering aunt&rsquo;s wishes and plans. Moreover, his admiration and love for Elizabeth also make him overcome his own prejudices regarding social class and marriage as well as the risk of another humiliating rejection.</p><p>In other words, Darcy is <strong>a developing character</strong>. Initially, he is a proud and prejudiced man, but he manages to overcome these flaws and changes because of his love for Elizabeth. In Austen, love truly has redeeming powers!</p><p>Consider also that&nbsp;the novel generally follows Elizabeth&rsquo;s point of view&nbsp;and only occasionally gives a direct insight into Darcy&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. Darcy&rsquo;s full character is only conveyed gradually.

He is 28 years old (p. 259),\u0026nbsp;has a sister, Georgiana, and his parents have died (p. 141).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe is also the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and is intended to marry her daughter.\u0026nbsp;However, by the end of the novel, he marries the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. He is also a close friend\u0026nbsp;of another key character, Charles Bingley, and the cousin of Colonel\u0026nbsp;Fitzwilliam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few details are offered about his physical traits, suggesting he is \u003cstrong\u003ea good-looking man:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien [...]\u0026nbsp;The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley. (p. 6)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn another excerpt, we see Darcy from Mrs. Gardiner\u0026rsquo;s point of view: \u0026ldquo;He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 178).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ebd56847-fa50-4159-b542-19d17d77508c\u0022\u003eInner characterisation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy\u0026rsquo;s inner characterisation is constructed both directly by the narrator and other characters and indirectly through his speech, actions, thoughts, and attitudes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning of the novel, Darcy comes across as being \u003cstrong\u003edisagreeable\u003c/strong\u003e, because he is very \u003cstrong\u003eaware of class differences\u003c/strong\u003e and his superior social status. This makes him \u003cstrong\u003eseem vain and proud\u003c/strong\u003e. As a wealthy aristocrat with a cold attitude, Darcy makes everyone in Meryton dislike him: \u0026ldquo;Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\u0026rdquo; (p. 10). For example, during the first ball, Darcy argues that \u0026ldquo;Every savage can dance\u0026rdquo; (p. 17), showing his snobbish contempt for the happy village people dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe is \u003cstrong\u003euncomfortable in social situations\u003c/strong\u003e except amongst his close friends. He later tells Elizabeth that he is \u0026ldquo;ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers\u0026rdquo; (p. 123). He goes on to say:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess [...]\u0026nbsp;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done\u0026rdquo; (p. 123). This also shows that Darcy is aware of at least some of his failings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAt first, he is not attracted to Elizabeth\u003c/strong\u003e, refusing to invite her to dance: \u0026ldquo;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.\u0026rdquo; (p. 7). However, as the story progresses, he becomes attracted to her despite his reason.\u0026nbsp;Darcy finds himself in an awkward position because he increasingly likes Elizabeth while also resenting her family\u0026rsquo;s low social status and lack of manners:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.\u0026nbsp;(p. 15)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsequently, he continues to act unkindly towards her, making her resent him even more. His attitude towards her is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A snob is someone who has an exaggerated respect for higher social status and disregards those of lower status.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0022\u003esnobbish and he hides behind his rationality\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.\u0026rdquo; (p. 36).\u0026nbsp;Darcy disregards Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s family because of their lower social status and therefore considers a marriage to her unrealistic. After a few interactions, Elizabeth is convinced that his \u0026ldquo;unforgiving temper\u0026rdquo; (p. 57) makes him a\u003cstrong\u003e \u0026ldquo;dreadful\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e (p. 57) person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArguing that Jane is indifferent to Bingley, Darcy\u0026nbsp;persuades Bingley to leave Netherfield. He is a very \u003cstrong\u003eloyal and protective friend\u003c/strong\u003e, but his attitude also suggests that he is \u003cstrong\u003earrogant\u003c/strong\u003e and believes he knows better than his friend. He later tells Elizabeth that his decision was based on impartial observation, suggesting that he (like Elizabeth) \u003cstrong\u003eprides himself on his perceptivity\u003c/strong\u003e (p. 10,\u0026nbsp;p. 130).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Darcy and Elizabeth meet again at the estate of his aunt, Lady Catherine, their interactions there make him \u003cstrong\u003eaccept that he is in love with her\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\u0026rdquo; (p. 132). Despite his prejudices, he asks her to marry him, rationally explaining his objections to her family and social status\u0026nbsp;but claiming he will ignore them. When Elizabeth becomes offended and bluntly refuses him while also accusing\u0026nbsp;him of mistreating Wickham and of separating Bingley and Jane, Darcy is shocked. He absolutely expected Elizabeth to accept his proposal, indicating his \u003cstrong\u003earrogance and lack of perceptivity towards her feelings\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He \u003cem\u003espoke\u003c/em\u003e of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security\u0026rdquo; (p. 133). His pride receives a severe blow when she refuses him, and he is takes his leave with a sarcastic reply:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\u0026rsquo; (p. 135)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, upon reflection, Darcy writes Elizabeth a long letter, addressing her accusations and explaining his actions. The letter is \u003cstrong\u003epolite and rational\u003c/strong\u003e, but Darcy later explains his feelings: \u0026ldquo;When I wrote that letter [...]\u0026nbsp;I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit\u0026rdquo; (p. 258). This shows that Darcy did not understand himself or his own feelings up until Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s rejection of him. We get the feeling that Darcy is used to being a rational man in control of himself. When he falls deeply in love with Elizabeth (who does not want him), he is at a loss. However, her brutal rejection of him is \u003cstrong\u003ea turning point for his character\u003c/strong\u003e, a reality check, and he then begins to be perceptive about himself and others. When Elizabeth eventually\u0026nbsp;accepts his proposal in the ending, he explains this more fully:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. (p. 259)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlready when the two of them meet again at Darcy\u0026rsquo;s estate, we see that Darcy \u003cstrong\u003eis making\u0026nbsp;an effort to act in a kinder and more sociable way\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eHe is polite towards Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s relatives and introduces her to his sister, suggesting that he is eager to compensate for his previously arrogant behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy also makes amends for his previous attitude in\u0026nbsp;the episode with Lydia and Wickham. Because he \u003cstrong\u003efeels responsible for not exposing Wickham\u0026rsquo;s character\u003c/strong\u003e in the past, Darcy intervenes in the affair and convinces Wickham\u0026nbsp;to marry Lydia in exchange for paying his gambling debts (pp. 226-227).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEncouraged by the fact that Elizabeth refused to promise his aunt not to marry him, he repeats\u0026nbsp;his marriage proposal \u0026ndash; which Elizabeth accepts this time: \u0026ldquo;You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.\u0026nbsp;My\u0026nbsp;affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.\u0026rdquo; (p. 256). This also shows \u003cstrong\u003eDarcy\u0026rsquo;s courage\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eand strong feelings for Elizabeth\u003c/strong\u003e as he acts against his domineering aunt\u0026rsquo;s wishes and plans. Moreover, his admiration and love for Elizabeth also make him overcome his own prejudices regarding social class and marriage as well as the risk of another humiliating rejection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, Darcy is \u003cstrong\u003ea developing character\u003c/strong\u003e. Initially, he is a proud and prejudiced man, but he manages to overcome these flaws and changes because of his love for Elizabeth. In Austen, love truly has redeeming powers!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider also that\u0026nbsp;the novel generally follows Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s point of view\u0026nbsp;and only occasionally gives a direct insight into Darcy\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. Darcy\u0026rsquo;s full character is only conveyed gradually.
