The most relevant example is his general sarcasm and passiveness; even his youngest daughter's catastrophic elopement with Wichkam does not effect any permanent change in him. He still prefers to reamin fairly aloof concerning family issues.</p><p>In terms of his outer characterisation, Mr Bennet owns the Longbourn house and estate which brings the family about £2,000 a year (p. 18). He is married to Mrs Bennet and they have five daughters together. He is also educated and passionate about books.</p><h3  id="heading-3">Inner characterisation</h3><p>The inner characterisation of Mr Bennet reveals that he is quite<strong> intelligent</strong>. However, he is also no longer in love&nbsp;with his (less intelligent) wife and tends to be rather <strong>distant</strong> with most of his family, with the exception of Elizabeth. About halfway through the novel, Austen gives the readers an explanation of his character and his relationship with his family:</p><blockquote><p>Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. (pp. 164-165)</p></blockquote><p>In the first part of the novel in particular, we see Mr Bennet being rather<strong> irritated by his wife and daughters, </strong>reacting to them with sarcasm and humour but also finding satisfaction in teasing them, particularly his wife:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.&rsquo; (p. 2)</p></blockquote><p>The first chapter ends with a direct characterisation of Mr&nbsp;Bennet provided by the narrator: &ldquo;Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 3). This characterisation presents Mr&nbsp;Bennet as <strong>intelligent and funny&nbsp;but also rather eccentric</strong>.</p><p>Mr&nbsp;Bennet is a bit of a loner and feels <strong>self-sufficient and detached from his family</strong>. This is suggested by the fact that he often withdraws from conversations and prefers the company of books. During his first meeting with his cousin Mr Collins, he behaves in a classic Mr Bennet way:</p><blockquote><p>Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure. (p. 48)</p></blockquote><p>Here, we see Mr&nbsp;Bennet choosing&nbsp;to detach himself from the family conversation, quietly enjoying himself without needing to share his thoughts with others. In many ways,<strong> he is an observer of life</strong> rather than taking part in it, which underlines his passiveness in many situations.</p><p>Mr Bennet's <strong>humour and sarcasm</strong> seem&nbsp;to be his ways of coping with frustrations and difficult situations. For example, even after Lydia's escape and marriage with Wickham, he&nbsp;doesn't lose his dark sense of humour: &ldquo; &lsquo;I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite.&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 266).</p><p>He <strong>feels more attached to Elizabeth</strong> because he thinks she is his most intelligent daughter; he sees himself in her. That is why he thinks Mr Collins is beneath her and he sarcastically objects to such a marriage:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do <em>not </em>marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you <em>do</em>.&rsquo; (p. 79)</p></blockquote><p>Despite his love for Elizabeth, you could argue that&nbsp;Mr Bennet <strong>comes across as a less than ideal father </strong>since his way of handling his family ends up having consequences. Most notably when Lydia runs away with Wickham because Mr Bennet let her go to Brighton to meet with the militia, despite Elizabeth's warnings. You may interpret this in two ways. You may say that he is really just an indulgent father who lets his daughters do as they want and allows them a bit more freedom than most fathers of the time. On the other hand, you might also argue that this type of <strong>passive parenting</strong> almost damages the reputation of his daughter and the entire family.</p><p>Mr Bennet is in no respects an active man. He seems disappointed with&nbsp;his family situation but has passively accepted it&nbsp;instead of trying to better it. His passiveness even stretches to Lydia's elopement where <strong>he quickly&nbsp;gives up</strong>&nbsp;finding her and leaves&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Gardiner to continue the search.</p><p>Despite being the most well-educated person of the family, Mr Bennet <strong>does very little to improve the minds of his daughters </strong>and thereby fails his responsibility as a father. Elizabeth fully realises this, and the fatal consequences of it, when Lydia runs away and thereby damages the reputation of the entire family:</p><blockquote><p>But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,&nbsp; might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. (p. 165)</p></blockquote><p>However, Mr Bennet&nbsp;shows that he is <strong>aware of his own character and its flaws</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;You must not be too severe upon yourself,&rsquo; replied Elizabeth.<br />&lsquo;You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.&rsquo; (pp. 207-208)</p></blockquote><p>When Lydia is found, and she gets married, Mr&nbsp;Bennet&rsquo;s attitude suggests he does have both <strong>pride and honour</strong>. He wants to find ways to repay Mr&nbsp;Gardiner for making the marriage possible. At the same time, he refuses to have Lydia and Wickham in his house: &ldquo;Into <em>one</em> house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance&rdquo; (p. 215).&nbsp;He is, however, persuaded by his wife and daughters to receive the new couple for a visit.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr Bennet is<strong>&nbsp;happy that Elizabeth and Jane make advantageous marriages to good men</strong>. For example, he talks about Jane making a good match while also pointing out&nbsp;Jane and Bingley&rsquo;s naïve natures:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;You are a good girl, and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have no doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.&rsquo; (p. 243)</p></blockquote><p>He never loses his wry sense of humour, even when three of his five daughters manage to marry through no real help of his.</p><h2 data-guid="801a2c53-7505-45ff-90e4-716b5fe20e1d" id="heading-4">Mrs Bennet</h2><h3 id="heading-5" >Outer characterisation</h3><p>Mrs Bennet is a secondary, flat character in the novel <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen, like her husband Mr Bennet.&nbsp;Her ideas and behaviour do not change as a result of the action. <strong>Her goal remains to marry off her daughters</strong>, and she continues to act in rather embarrassing ways.</p><p>Her outer characterisation tells us that she has a brother as well as a sister&nbsp;and&nbsp;does not come from the gentry class as she was the daughter of an attorney, not of a landowning person (p. 19). She married Mr&nbsp;Bennet with a dowry of £4,000&nbsp;(p. 19), and they have five daughters together. In her youth, she was a beautiful woman (p. 2) which is what attracted Mr Bennet in the first place (p. 164).&nbsp;</p><h3  id="heading-6">Inner characterisation</h3><p>Mrs Bennet&rsquo;s inner characterisation suggests that she is <strong>frivolous, lacks good manners, and does not give her daughters the education they need</strong>. Initially, she is described directly: &ldquo;She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper&rdquo; (p. 3).</p><p>From the beginning of the novel, her <strong>only goal is for&nbsp;her daughters to marry well</strong>. Apart from this goal, she also <strong>likes gossiping</strong>: &ldquo;The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news&rdquo; (p. 3)</p><p>She also <strong>takes pride in her past beauty</strong> and believes that her daughters inherited their beauty from her: &ldquo;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <em>have</em> had my share of beauty&rdquo; (p. 2).</p><p>She is <strong>embarrassing </strong>without realising so herself, especially in the eyes of Elizabeth. One example&nbsp;is when Elizabeth&nbsp;tries to calm her mother down&nbsp;in front of Darcy by 'translating' what Darcy just said:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken&rsquo;, said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. &lsquo;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.&rsquo; (p. 30)</p></blockquote><p>In fact, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet &nbsp;is often <strong>quick to draw conclusions about others</strong>, Darcy in particular.</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;But I can assure you,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.&rsquo; (p. 8)</p></blockquote><p>The dialogue in the novel suggests Mrs Bennet can be very <strong>noisy</strong> and <strong>tiresome</strong> to others: &ldquo;Nobody can tell what I suffer! &mdash; But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.&rdquo; (p. 81). She frequently says something inappropriate: &ldquo;Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done&rdquo; (p. 159). In many ways, Mr Bennet must sometimes feel like he has six daughters, not five. However, Mrs Bennet is happily ignorant of how her husband really looks down on her.</p><p>As she <strong>constantly worries about marrying her daughter off</strong>, her behaviour actually has the opposite effect because her manner pushes people like the Bingleys and Darcy away, because they look down on her for being ill-bred and vulgar.</p><p>She is <strong>willing to go to extremes</strong>, such as encouraging Jane to ride through the rain and catch a cold to saty with Bingley. She is also <strong>overly indulgent</strong> towards her favourite daughter Lydia, encouraging her to flirt with the officers and behave badly, the result of which is that Lydia elopes with Mr Wickham.</p><p>Despite being distraught when Lydia runs away, Mrs Bennet becomes <strong>jubilant</strong>&nbsp;when she hears about Lydia's marriage and boasts about it to everyone without realising that the scandal of that marriage ought to be hushed down. She also entirely changes her opinion of Wickham, just as she entirely changes her opinion of Mr Darcy when she learns that Elizabeth is going to marry him. The following rant here shows hos she has fairly flexible views on people that may be changed according to her own interest:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;How rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane&rsquo;s is nothing to it&mdash;nothing at all. I am so pleased&mdash;so happy. Such a charming man!&mdash;so handsome! so tall!&mdash;Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.&rsquo; (p. 266)</p></blockquote><p>However, through her character, the author helps us understand how important marriage was for women during that day&nbsp;and age. Although Mrs Bennet&nbsp;makes some questionable decisions and comes off as rather annoying, she is <strong>heartfelt</strong> in her search for a husband for her daughters and understands that marriage with a wealthy&nbsp;man is the only way for them to secure a good future. She is also one of the characters who <strong>contribute with comical elements </strong>in the novel.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/analysis/characters/mr-wickham" title="Characterisation of Mr Wickham from Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Mr Wickham</span></a><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/analysis/setting" title="Setting of Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Setting</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The most relevant example is his general sarcasm and passiveness; even his youngest daughter\u0027s catastrophic elopement with Wichkam does not effect any permanent change in him. He still prefers to reamin fairly aloof concerning family issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of his outer characterisation, Mr Bennet owns the Longbourn house and estate which brings the family about £2,000 a year (p. 18). He is married to Mrs Bennet and they have five daughters together. He is also educated and passionate about books.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3  id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eInner characterisation\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe inner characterisation of Mr Bennet reveals that he is quite\u003cstrong\u003e intelligent\u003c/strong\u003e. However, he is also no longer in love\u0026nbsp;with his (less intelligent) wife and tends to be rather \u003cstrong\u003edistant\u003c/strong\u003e with most of his family, with the exception of Elizabeth. About halfway through the novel, Austen gives the readers an explanation of his character and his relationship with his family:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. (pp. 164-165)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the first part of the novel in particular, we see Mr Bennet being rather\u003cstrong\u003e irritated by his wife and daughters, \u003c/strong\u003ereacting to them with sarcasm and humour but also finding satisfaction in teasing them, particularly his wife:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\u0026rsquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026lsquo;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.\u0026rsquo; (p. 2)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first chapter ends with a direct characterisation of Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet provided by the narrator: \u0026ldquo;Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 3). This characterisation presents Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet as \u003cstrong\u003eintelligent and funny\u0026nbsp;but also rather eccentric\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr\u0026nbsp;Bennet is a bit of a loner and feels \u003cstrong\u003eself-sufficient and detached from his family\u003c/strong\u003e. This is suggested by the fact that he often withdraws from conversations and prefers the company of books. During his first meeting with his cousin Mr Collins, he behaves in a classic Mr Bennet way:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Bennet\u0026rsquo;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure. (p. 48)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere, we see Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet choosing\u0026nbsp;to detach himself from the family conversation, quietly enjoying himself without needing to share his thoughts with others. In many ways,\u003cstrong\u003e he is an observer of life\u003c/strong\u003e rather than taking part in it, which underlines his passiveness in many situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr Bennet\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003ehumour and sarcasm\u003c/strong\u003e seem\u0026nbsp;to be his ways of coping with frustrations and difficult situations. For example, even after Lydia\u0027s escape and marriage with Wickham, he\u0026nbsp;doesn\u0027t lose his dark sense of humour: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\u0026rsquo; said he. \u0026lsquo;Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite.\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 266).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe \u003cstrong\u003efeels more attached to Elizabeth\u003c/strong\u003e because he thinks she is his most intelligent daughter; he sees himself in her. That is why he thinks Mr Collins is beneath her and he sarcastically objects to such a marriage:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003emarry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rsquo; (p. 79)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite his love for Elizabeth, you could argue that\u0026nbsp;Mr Bennet \u003cstrong\u003ecomes across as a less than ideal father \u003c/strong\u003esince his way of handling his family ends up having consequences. Most notably when Lydia runs away with Wickham because Mr Bennet let her go to Brighton to meet with the militia, despite Elizabeth\u0027s warnings. You may interpret this in two ways. You may say that he is really just an indulgent father who lets his daughters do as they want and allows them a bit more freedom than most fathers of the time. On the other hand, you might also argue that this type of \u003cstrong\u003epassive parenting\u003c/strong\u003e almost damages the reputation of his daughter and the entire family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr Bennet is in no respects an active man. He seems disappointed with\u0026nbsp;his family situation but has passively accepted it\u0026nbsp;instead of trying to better it. His passiveness even stretches to Lydia\u0027s elopement where \u003cstrong\u003ehe quickly\u0026nbsp;gives up\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;finding her and leaves\u0026nbsp;Mr\u0026nbsp;Gardiner to continue the search.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite being the most well-educated person of the family, Mr Bennet \u003cstrong\u003edoes very little to improve the minds of his daughters \u003c/strong\u003eand thereby fails his responsibility as a father. Elizabeth fully realises this, and the fatal consequences of it, when Lydia runs away and thereby damages the reputation of the entire family:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\u0026nbsp; might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. (p. 165)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Mr Bennet\u0026nbsp;shows that he is \u003cstrong\u003eaware of his own character and its flaws\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\u0026rsquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026lsquo;You must not be too severe upon yourself,\u0026rsquo; replied Elizabeth.\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026lsquo;You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.\u0026rsquo; (pp. 207-208)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Lydia is found, and she gets married, Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet\u0026rsquo;s attitude suggests he does have both \u003cstrong\u003epride and honour\u003c/strong\u003e. He wants to find ways to repay Mr\u0026nbsp;Gardiner for making the marriage possible. At the same time, he refuses to have Lydia and Wickham in his house: \u0026ldquo;Into \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance\u0026rdquo; (p. 215).\u0026nbsp;He is, however, persuaded by his wife and daughters to receive the new couple for a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Mr Bennet is\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;happy that Elizabeth and Jane make advantageous marriages to good men\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, he talks about Jane making a good match while also pointing out\u0026nbsp;Jane and Bingley\u0026rsquo;s naïve natures:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;You are a good girl, and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have no doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\u0026rsquo; (p. 243)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe never loses his wry sense of humour, even when three of his five daughters manage to marry through no real help of his.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022801a2c53-7505-45ff-90e4-716b5fe20e1d\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eMrs Bennet\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 \u003eOuter characterisation\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMrs Bennet is a secondary, flat character in the novel \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e by Jane Austen, like her husband Mr Bennet.\u0026nbsp;Her ideas and behaviour do not change as a result of the action. \u003cstrong\u003eHer goal remains to marry off her daughters\u003c/strong\u003e, and she continues to act in rather embarrassing ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer outer characterisation tells us that she has a brother as well as a sister\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;does not come from the gentry class as she was the daughter of an attorney, not of a landowning person (p. 19). She married Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet with a dowry of £4,000\u0026nbsp;(p. 19), and they have five daughters together. In her youth, she was a beautiful woman (p. 2) which is what attracted Mr Bennet in the first place (p. 164).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3  id=\u0022heading-6\u0022\u003eInner characterisation\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMrs Bennet\u0026rsquo;s inner characterisation suggests that she is \u003cstrong\u003efrivolous, lacks good manners, and does not give her daughters the education they need\u003c/strong\u003e. Initially, she is described directly: \u0026ldquo;She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper\u0026rdquo; (p. 3).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning of the novel, her \u003cstrong\u003eonly goal is for\u0026nbsp;her daughters to marry well\u003c/strong\u003e. Apart from this goal, she also \u003cstrong\u003elikes gossiping\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news\u0026rdquo; (p. 3)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe also \u003cstrong\u003etakes pride in her past beauty\u003c/strong\u003e and believes that her daughters inherited their beauty from her: \u0026ldquo;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e had my share of beauty\u0026rdquo; (p. 2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe is \u003cstrong\u003eembarrassing \u003c/strong\u003ewithout realising so herself, especially in the eyes of Elizabeth. One example\u0026nbsp;is when Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;tries to calm her mother down\u0026nbsp;in front of Darcy by \u0027translating\u0027 what Darcy just said:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken\u0026rsquo;, said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. \u0026lsquo;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.\u0026rsquo; (p. 30)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet \u0026nbsp;is often \u003cstrong\u003equick to draw conclusions about others\u003c/strong\u003e, Darcy in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;But I can assure you,\u0026rsquo; she added, \u0026lsquo;that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\u0026rsquo; (p. 8)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dialogue in the novel suggests Mrs Bennet can be very \u003cstrong\u003enoisy\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003etiresome\u003c/strong\u003e to others: \u0026ldquo;Nobody can tell what I suffer! \u0026mdash; But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\u0026rdquo; (p. 81). She frequently says something inappropriate: \u0026ldquo;Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done\u0026rdquo; (p. 159). In many ways, Mr Bennet must sometimes feel like he has six daughters, not five. However, Mrs Bennet is happily ignorant of how her husband really looks down on her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs she \u003cstrong\u003econstantly worries about marrying her daughter off\u003c/strong\u003e, her behaviour actually has the opposite effect because her manner pushes people like the Bingleys and Darcy away, because they look down on her for being ill-bred and vulgar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe is \u003cstrong\u003ewilling to go to extremes\u003c/strong\u003e, such as encouraging Jane to ride through the rain and catch a cold to saty with Bingley. She is also \u003cstrong\u003eoverly indulgent\u003c/strong\u003e towards her favourite daughter Lydia, encouraging her to flirt with the officers and behave badly, the result of which is that Lydia elopes with Mr Wickham.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite being distraught when Lydia runs away, Mrs Bennet becomes \u003cstrong\u003ejubilant\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;when she hears about Lydia\u0027s marriage and boasts about it to everyone without realising that the scandal of that marriage ought to be hushed down. She also entirely changes her opinion of Wickham, just as she entirely changes her opinion of Mr Darcy when she learns that Elizabeth is going to marry him. The following rant here shows hos she has fairly flexible views on people that may be changed according to her own interest:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;How rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane\u0026rsquo;s is nothing to it\u0026mdash;nothing at all. I am so pleased\u0026mdash;so happy. Such a charming man!\u0026mdash;so handsome! so tall!\u0026mdash;Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\u0026rsquo; (p. 266)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, through her character, the author helps us understand how important marriage was for women during that day\u0026nbsp;and age. Although Mrs Bennet\u0026nbsp;makes some questionable decisions and comes off as rather annoying, she is \u003cstrong\u003eheartfelt\u003c/strong\u003e in her search for a husband for her daughters and understands that marriage with a wealthy\u0026nbsp;man is the only way for them to secure a good future. She is also one of the characters who \u003cstrong\u003econtribute with comical elements \u003c/strong\u003ein the novel.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Characterisation of Mr \u0026 Mrs Bennet from Pride and Prejudice","MetaDescription":"Mr Bennet is a secondary character in Austen\u0027s Pride and Prejudice and important for his relationship with his family and his daughter Elizabeth in particular.
