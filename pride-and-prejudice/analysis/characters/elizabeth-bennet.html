She is 20 years old (p. 117), unmarried, and is entitled to a relatively small <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;property or money brought by a bride to her husband on their marriage&lt;/p&gt;">dowry</span> of £1,000 (p. 76) from her father when she marries. She is either referred to as Elizabeth, Lizzy, or Eliza.</p><p>She is considered <strong>beautiful </strong>(p. 187), and Darcy in particular is attracted by her dark eyes (p. 15). However, Darcy initially describes her as unattractive in the beginning of the novel: &ldquo;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me...&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 7).</p><p>Mr Bingley's sister, Mrs&nbsp;Hurst, also tries to dismiss Elizabeth&rsquo;s looks, after she has walked&nbsp;through muddy fields to visit Jane at Netherfield: &ldquo;Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!&rdquo; (p. 24). Bingley's other sister, Miss Bingley, also makes rather unkind comments about Elizabeth. She is motivated by jealousy when she describes Elizabeth as&nbsp;&ldquo;one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art&rdquo; (p. 27).&nbsp;</p><p>In this way, we are able to see what impression Elizabeth&nbsp;can make on some and how other women might feel threatened by her because she is beautiful and acts in an unusually confident way.</p><p>Finally, we get a glimpse of Elizabeth&rsquo;s physical appearance when she goes to the Netherfield ball: &ldquo;She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart&rdquo; (p. 63).&nbsp;This suggests that Elizabeth knows&nbsp;how to use clothes to highlight her beauty. Here, she does this because she wants to impress Wickham &ndash; who never shows up at the ball.</p><p>We also know that Lady Catherine describes her as &ldquo;a very genteel, pretty kind of girl&rdquo; (p. 115). This also suggests that Elizabeth has a pleasant appearance.</p><h2 data-guid="02f135a7-c463-4d63-af38-f75173550365" id="heading-2">Inner characterisation</h2><p>In general, Elizabeth is characterised by intelligence, courage, and her willingness to speak her mind. Elizabeth also prides herself on being very perceptive (p. 28,&nbsp;p. 76,&nbsp;p. 179), but this also leads to her developing prejudices.</p><h3 id="heading-3">Intelligence and honesty</h3><p>Mr Bennet generally does not have a high opinion of the intelligence of his five girls, but he sees&nbsp;Elizabeth as <strong>the cleverest of his daughters</strong>:&nbsp;&ldquo; &lsquo;They have none of them much to recommend them,&rsquo; replied he; &lsquo;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters&rdquo; (p. 2).&nbsp;Lizzy is, consequently, his favourite, much to Mrs Bennet's dismay: &ldquo;You are always giving her the preference&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 2).</p><p>Most of Elizabeth's&nbsp;intelligence is conveyed through dialogue, as she <strong>expresses her point of view convincingly</strong> in many circumstances. One example is when she discusses Darcy&rsquo;s attitude and character, in front of him:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.&rsquo; (p. 34)</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, Elizabeth <strong>has the courage to be honest even with the rather tyrannical Lady Catherine</strong> that questions her about her sisters and family. In her reply, Elizabeth talks about the importance of treating all her sisters equally and giving them a chance to be out in society even if the elder ones are still unmarried. Her straightforward answers displeases&nbsp;the bossy Lady Catherine: &ldquo;Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence&rdquo; (p. 116).</p><p>Elizabeth also has to put up with the snobbishness&nbsp;of women like the Bingley sisters, but she often manages to rise above their provocations (p. 27).</p><h3 id="heading-4">Prejudices</h3><p>Elizabeth's honesty can also be perceived as sharp-tongued&nbsp;and sometimes leads her to making quick assumptions about people, which sometimes are wrong. The most obvious examples are her <strong>prejudices</strong> about Darcy and her initial attraction to Wickham. Also, at one point she&nbsp;exposes her views about men in general based on what she thinks&nbsp;of Darcy, Bingley, Wickham, and Collins: &ldquo;Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.&rdquo; (p. 108).&nbsp;</p><p>Another example is that Elizabeth draws negative conclusions about Darcy and the Bingleys after she sees them for the first time at the ball:</p><blockquote><p>Their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. (pp. 9-10)</p></blockquote><p>Also, for Elizabeth, Wickham is appealing initially&nbsp;because he appears to be&nbsp;different from the arrogant and rude Darcy. And because she <strong>trusts her first impressions of people</strong>, she never questions Wickham&rsquo;s story about Darcy cheating him out of his inheritance.</p><h3 id="heading-5">Stubbornness and independence</h3><p>Unlike her mother, Elizabeth is <strong>not only interested in wealth and status when it comes to suitors</strong>. Instead, she appreciates good manners, intelligence, and kindness. She is determined not to marry for money, although this is exactly what she needs to do because her family is not that wealthy.</p><p>Lizzy&nbsp;can also be stubborn and independent, refusing to let others dictate her behaviour, and she seems to take pride in this: &ldquo;There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me&rdquo; (p. 122).</p><p>She can also be rather <strong>unconventional</strong> and stubborn, especially when it comes to respecting social etiquette of her day. For example, she walks through the mud to Netherfield Park to see her sick sister&nbsp;against her mother's advice. This behaviour&nbsp;is considered very un-ladylike by the Bingley&rsquo;s sisters.</p><p>She also boldly rejects Mr. Collins&rsquo; marriage proposal (p. 77), a situation which shows her <strong>strength of character</strong>&nbsp;but also the fact that Elizabeth <strong>wants to marry for love</strong> and not entirely for material goods or to please her family.</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Really, Mr. Collins,&rsquo; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, &lsquo;you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.&rsquo; (p. 77)</p></blockquote><p>She is also <strong>disappointed</strong> when her friend Charlotte accepts Mr Collins&rsquo; marriage proposal:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.&rsquo; (p. 95)</p></blockquote><p>However, she later comes to understand Charlotte&rsquo;s reasons better and accepts&nbsp;that Charlotte simply enjoys having her own home and a degree of independence. Marrying Collins has saved Charlotte from spinsterhood and being a burden to her family.</p><p>Elizabeth also reveals her <strong>dignity</strong> when Lady Catherine comes to Longbourn to scold her and question her about rumors of an engagement with Darcy. Elizabeth does not allow the Lady to mistreat her and is honest about her situation. Her attitude also shows that she <strong>believes in the distinction of class</strong> and also that she believes she is Darcy&rsquo;s equal: &ldquo;He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter; so far we are equal&rdquo; (p. 249).</p><h3 id="heading-6">Sense of humour</h3><p>Elizabeth is also&nbsp;<strong>light-hearted</strong>. She confesses that &ldquo;I dearly love a laugh&rdquo; (pp. 39-40), and&nbsp;in another instance, the narrator tells us that &ldquo;she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 7). The same idea is suggested through the fact that she is always able to make fun of her circumstances:</p><blockquote><p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. (p. 63)</p></blockquote><p>In another instance, her sense of humour is suggested by her joking about loving Darcy because of his wealth: &ldquo;But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley&rdquo; (p. 262).</p><h3 id="heading-7">Relationship with her family</h3><p>In her family, Elizabeth<strong> struggles with the attitude of her desperate mother, her father&rsquo;s aloofness, and the frivolity and bad behaviour of her younger sisters</strong>, Kitty and Lydia. Elizabeth often analyses her family&rsquo;s actions and reaches negative conclusions about her parents.</p><p>Although she is initially offended by Darcy&rsquo;s description of the impropriety of her family&rsquo;s actions, she eventually has to admit that she agrees with him: &ldquo;When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe&rdquo; (p. 146).</p><p>However, Elizabeth&nbsp;<strong>relies on her father</strong> as the head of the family. One example is when she refuses to marry Collins and is &ldquo;determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive&rdquo; (p. 78). Another example is when she hopes her father will stop Mary from playing the piano and embarrassing herself: &ldquo;She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night&rdquo; (p. 71). She knows that her father, and not her mother, is the voice of reason in the family.</p><p>Of all her sisters, Elizabeth is <strong>the closest to her gentle sister Jane</strong>, discussing important matters with her and trying to take care of her. This is suggested by the fact that she goes to look after her at Netherfield Park when Jane gets a cold (pp. 21-22), but also by the fact that she knows Jane is saddened by Bingley&rsquo;s departure which makes Elizabeth avoid mentioning him to her. Although the two sisters are very different in nature, they are very close.</p><p>She <strong>cares about the family's well-being and reputation</strong>&nbsp;and would like to protect it. This is suggested by her thoughts and actions after finding out her sister Lydia has run&nbsp;away with Mr Wickham: &ldquo;Lydia&mdash;the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 192).&nbsp;</p><p>However, even after she gets engaged with Darcy, she <strong>remains dissatisfied with her family</strong> and their behaviour in front of him: &ldquo;Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification&rdquo; (p. 270). This suggests she wants to avoid her family being judged by Darcy and wishes to control her family so their behaviour&nbsp;will not&nbsp;expose them as inferior to Darcy. Thus, <strong>Elizabeth is proud, too</strong>.</p><p>It is often speculated that <strong>Elizabeth is the heroine that comes the closest to reflecting Jane Austen's own personality and views</strong>. Particularly because of her liveliness, irony, and outspokenness. This comparison&nbsp;is for instance based on letters written by Jane Austen to her friends and relatives. Her tone seem a lot like Lizzy's.</p><h2 id="heading-8" data-guid="5ddc4f0d-12e6-42c9-afbf-08d4cc738837">Relationship with Darcy</h2><p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s dislike for Darcy increases in Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>every&nbsp;time they meet until the Netherfield party departs for winter. Initially, Darcy hurts Elizabeth's&nbsp;pride by calling her &lsquo;tolerable&rsquo;. This, combined with Darcy&rsquo;s superior attitude, makes her <strong>judgemental and resentful towards him</strong>: &ldquo;I&nbsp;could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine&rdquo; (p. 13).</p><p>Nevertheless, seeing her mother acting silly&nbsp;during the Netherfield ball makes Elizabeth feel <strong>embarrassed </strong>as she is hurt by what Darcy might be thinking about her family: &ldquo;Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded&rdquo; (p. 71).</p><p>When winter is over, Elizabeth and Mr Darcy&nbsp;meet&nbsp;at Rosings Park, his aunt's estate. When Darcy&rsquo;s cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy prevented Bingley from marrying Jane by convincing him to return to London, Elizabeth is very <strong>angry</strong>. This is part of the reason why, when Darcy proposes, she immediately rejects him:</p><blockquote><p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. (pp. 132-133)</p></blockquote><p>Also, when Darcy talks about the inferiority of her circumstances during his proposal, she offends him by suggesting his proposal was not gentleman-like and by accusing him of acting badly towards Wickham and her sister Jane: &ldquo; &lsquo;I might as well enquire,&rsquo; replied she, &lsquo;why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 133).</p><p>Darcy&rsquo;s ensuing explanatory letter makes Elizabeth angry at first. Furthermore, her <strong>prejudice</strong> makes her want to dismiss what he says in the letter: &ldquo;With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield&rdquo; (p. 142). The fact that she re-reads the letter and begins to take his arguments into account marks her change. It shows that she<strong> is willing to change her perspective</strong> and reevaluate her own judgmental behavior&nbsp;and that she is sometimes <strong>insightful about her own character</strong>: &ldquo; &lsquo;How despicably have I acted!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities!&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 145).</p><p>Furthermore,<strong> Darcy also reconsiders his attitudes</strong>. Elizabeth&rsquo;s refusal shows Darcy that having superior social status is not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;and that happiness and openness are important:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.&rsquo; (p. 259)</p></blockquote><p>When Elizabeth sees Mr Darcy&rsquo;s house and grounds at Pemberley&nbsp;and hears a good account of his character from his servant, she starts to have<strong> doubts about rejecting Darcy</strong>. Later in the narrative, when Jane asks her when she first started to love Darcy, she replies: &ldquo;I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.&rdquo; (p. 262). Although she is joking, her answer might have some truth in it, as&nbsp;the beauty of the landscape at Pemberley, together with Darcy's servant's good account of him,&nbsp;might have softened her prejudice towards the owner and prepared her for&nbsp;falling in love with him. When Darcy&nbsp;shows up unexpectedly<strong>, </strong>Elizabeth is&nbsp;both <strong>shamed</strong> that he caught her visiting his house after rejecting his proposal (p. 174), although estates were generally open to visitors back then,&nbsp;and <strong>impressed with the effort he makes</strong> to come across as better-mannered and to treat her family in a nicer way (p. 176).&nbsp;</p><p>When her trip is cut short by Lydia eloping with Wickham, Elizabeth feels <strong>guilty</strong> for not exposing Wickham and not being open with her family:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;When I consider,&rsquo; she added, in a yet more agitated voice, &lsquo;that I might have prevented it! &mdash; I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only &mdash; some part of what I learnt &mdash; to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now.&rsquo; (p. 191)</p></blockquote><p>This is also the time when Elizabeth<strong> feels she could fall in love with Darcy</strong>: &ldquo;never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain&rdquo; (p. 192). Elizabeth thinks the behaviour of Lydia will push Darcy away. In other words, it is only when Darcy becomes unavailable that Elizabeth begins to realise what she lost. Most of us can relate to this.</p><p>During the search for Lydia, Elizabeth spends a lot of time reflecting on her prejudices against Darcy and <strong>becomes more understanding</strong> of his good aspects and&nbsp;her own flaws:</p><blockquote><p>No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling.&nbsp;(p. 183)</p></blockquote><p>As Darcy and Bingley return to Longbourn, we see Elizabeth is <strong>in love with Darcy</strong> but has lost hope of them being together. She can&rsquo;t understand his actions: &ldquo;If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him&rdquo; (p. 236).</p><p>In her conversation&nbsp;with Lady Catherine, Elizabeth also has the <strong>courage</strong> to refuse not to promise to marry Darcy, suggesting her <strong>individualism</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.&rsquo; (p. 250)</p></blockquote><p>When Darcy restates his proposal, she happily accepts and manages to convince both her father and sister Jane that she is really in love with him.</p><p>Elizabeth also <strong>learns&nbsp;to understand both herself and Darcy</strong>&nbsp;and is able to hold her tongue sometimes, such as when she avoids making fun of Darcy's influence over Bingley in front of Darcy:</p><blockquote><p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. (p. 261)</p></blockquote><p>To sum up, <strong>Elizabeth&rsquo;s character changes over the course of the novel</strong>. She becomes able to recognise both her pride and&nbsp;prejudices and learns not to be hasty about passing judgments on others. These changes are what makes it possible for her to fall in love with Darcy and eventually marry him.&nbsp;Furthermore, her comments to him and her ability to criticise and laugh at him <strong>help to make him a better man</strong>. Thus, they are good for each other.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/analysis/characters" title="Characters of Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Characters</span></a><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/analysis/characters/mr-darcy" title="Characterisation of Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Mr Darcy</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

She is 20 years old (p. 117), unmarried, and is entitled to a relatively small \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;property or money brought by a bride to her husband on their marriage\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0022\u003edowry\u003c/span\u003e of £1,000 (p. 76) from her father when she marries. She is either referred to as Elizabeth, Lizzy, or Eliza.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe is considered \u003cstrong\u003ebeautiful \u003c/strong\u003e(p. 187), and Darcy in particular is attracted by her dark eyes (p. 15). However, Darcy initially describes her as unattractive in the beginning of the novel: \u0026ldquo;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me...\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 7).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr Bingley\u0027s sister, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Hurst, also tries to dismiss Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s looks, after she has walked\u0026nbsp;through muddy fields to visit Jane at Netherfield: \u0026ldquo;Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\u0026rdquo; (p. 24). Bingley\u0027s other sister, Miss Bingley, also makes rather unkind comments about Elizabeth. She is motivated by jealousy when she describes Elizabeth as\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art\u0026rdquo; (p. 27).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this way, we are able to see what impression Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;can make on some and how other women might feel threatened by her because she is beautiful and acts in an unusually confident way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, we get a glimpse of Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s physical appearance when she goes to the Netherfield ball: \u0026ldquo;She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart\u0026rdquo; (p. 63).\u0026nbsp;This suggests that Elizabeth knows\u0026nbsp;how to use clothes to highlight her beauty. Here, she does this because she wants to impress Wickham \u0026ndash; who never shows up at the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also know that Lady Catherine describes her as \u0026ldquo;a very genteel, pretty kind of girl\u0026rdquo; (p. 115). This also suggests that Elizabeth has a pleasant appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002202f135a7-c463-4d63-af38-f75173550365\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003eInner characterisation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, Elizabeth is characterised by intelligence, courage, and her willingness to speak her mind. Elizabeth also prides herself on being very perceptive (p. 28,\u0026nbsp;p. 76,\u0026nbsp;p. 179), but this also leads to her developing prejudices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eIntelligence and honesty\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr Bennet generally does not have a high opinion of the intelligence of his five girls, but he sees\u0026nbsp;Elizabeth as \u003cstrong\u003ethe cleverest of his daughters\u003c/strong\u003e:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;They have none of them much to recommend them,\u0026rsquo; replied he; \u0026lsquo;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters\u0026rdquo; (p. 2).\u0026nbsp;Lizzy is, consequently, his favourite, much to Mrs Bennet\u0027s dismay: \u0026ldquo;You are always giving her the preference\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of Elizabeth\u0027s\u0026nbsp;intelligence is conveyed through dialogue, as she \u003cstrong\u003eexpresses her point of view convincingly\u003c/strong\u003e in many circumstances. One example is when she discusses Darcy\u0026rsquo;s attitude and character, in front of him:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.\u0026rsquo; (p. 34)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Elizabeth \u003cstrong\u003ehas the courage to be honest even with the rather tyrannical Lady Catherine\u003c/strong\u003e that questions her about her sisters and family. In her reply, Elizabeth talks about the importance of treating all her sisters equally and giving them a chance to be out in society even if the elder ones are still unmarried. Her straightforward answers displeases\u0026nbsp;the bossy Lady Catherine: \u0026ldquo;Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence\u0026rdquo; (p. 116).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth also has to put up with the snobbishness\u0026nbsp;of women like the Bingley sisters, but she often manages to rise above their provocations (p. 27).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003ePrejudices\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth\u0027s honesty can also be perceived as sharp-tongued\u0026nbsp;and sometimes leads her to making quick assumptions about people, which sometimes are wrong. The most obvious examples are her \u003cstrong\u003eprejudices\u003c/strong\u003e about Darcy and her initial attraction to Wickham. Also, at one point she\u0026nbsp;exposes her views about men in general based on what she thinks\u0026nbsp;of Darcy, Bingley, Wickham, and Collins: \u0026ldquo;Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.\u0026rdquo; (p. 108).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example is that Elizabeth draws negative conclusions about Darcy and the Bingleys after she sees them for the first time at the ball:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. (pp. 9-10)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, for Elizabeth, Wickham is appealing initially\u0026nbsp;because he appears to be\u0026nbsp;different from the arrogant and rude Darcy. And because she \u003cstrong\u003etrusts her first impressions of people\u003c/strong\u003e, she never questions Wickham\u0026rsquo;s story about Darcy cheating him out of his inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022\u003eStubbornness and independence\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike her mother, Elizabeth is \u003cstrong\u003enot only interested in wealth and status when it comes to suitors\u003c/strong\u003e. Instead, she appreciates good manners, intelligence, and kindness. She is determined not to marry for money, although this is exactly what she needs to do because her family is not that wealthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLizzy\u0026nbsp;can also be stubborn and independent, refusing to let others dictate her behaviour, and she seems to take pride in this: \u0026ldquo;There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me\u0026rdquo; (p. 122).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe can also be rather \u003cstrong\u003eunconventional\u003c/strong\u003e and stubborn, especially when it comes to respecting social etiquette of her day. For example, she walks through the mud to Netherfield Park to see her sick sister\u0026nbsp;against her mother\u0027s advice. This behaviour\u0026nbsp;is considered very un-ladylike by the Bingley\u0026rsquo;s sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe also boldly rejects Mr. Collins\u0026rsquo; marriage proposal (p. 77), a situation which shows her \u003cstrong\u003estrength of character\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;but also the fact that Elizabeth \u003cstrong\u003ewants to marry for love\u003c/strong\u003e and not entirely for material goods or to please her family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Really, Mr. Collins,\u0026rsquo; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \u0026lsquo;you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\u0026rsquo; (p. 77)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe is also \u003cstrong\u003edisappointed\u003c/strong\u003e when her friend Charlotte accepts Mr Collins\u0026rsquo; marriage proposal:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\u0026rsquo; (p. 95)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, she later comes to understand Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s reasons better and accepts\u0026nbsp;that Charlotte simply enjoys having her own home and a degree of independence. Marrying Collins has saved Charlotte from spinsterhood and being a burden to her family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth also reveals her \u003cstrong\u003edignity\u003c/strong\u003e when Lady Catherine comes to Longbourn to scold her and question her about rumors of an engagement with Darcy. Elizabeth does not allow the Lady to mistreat her and is honest about her situation. Her attitude also shows that she \u003cstrong\u003ebelieves in the distinction of class\u003c/strong\u003e and also that she believes she is Darcy\u0026rsquo;s equal: \u0026ldquo;He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\u0026rsquo;s daughter; so far we are equal\u0026rdquo; (p. 249).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022\u003eSense of humour\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth is also\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003elight-hearted\u003c/strong\u003e. She confesses that \u0026ldquo;I dearly love a laugh\u0026rdquo; (pp. 39-40), and\u0026nbsp;in another instance, the narrator tells us that \u0026ldquo;she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 7). The same idea is suggested through the fact that she is always able to make fun of her circumstances:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. (p. 63)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn another instance, her sense of humour is suggested by her joking about loving Darcy because of his wealth: \u0026ldquo;But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley\u0026rdquo; (p. 262).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022\u003eRelationship with her family\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her family, Elizabeth\u003cstrong\u003e struggles with the attitude of her desperate mother, her father\u0026rsquo;s aloofness, and the frivolity and bad behaviour of her younger sisters\u003c/strong\u003e, Kitty and Lydia. Elizabeth often analyses her family\u0026rsquo;s actions and reaches negative conclusions about her parents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough she is initially offended by Darcy\u0026rsquo;s description of the impropriety of her family\u0026rsquo;s actions, she eventually has to admit that she agrees with him: \u0026ldquo;When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe\u0026rdquo; (p. 146).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003erelies on her father\u003c/strong\u003e as the head of the family. One example is when she refuses to marry Collins and is \u0026ldquo;determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive\u0026rdquo; (p. 78). Another example is when she hopes her father will stop Mary from playing the piano and embarrassing herself: \u0026ldquo;She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night\u0026rdquo; (p. 71). She knows that her father, and not her mother, is the voice of reason in the family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf all her sisters, Elizabeth is \u003cstrong\u003ethe closest to her gentle sister Jane\u003c/strong\u003e, discussing important matters with her and trying to take care of her. This is suggested by the fact that she goes to look after her at Netherfield Park when Jane gets a cold (pp. 21-22), but also by the fact that she knows Jane is saddened by Bingley\u0026rsquo;s departure which makes Elizabeth avoid mentioning him to her. Although the two sisters are very different in nature, they are very close.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe \u003cstrong\u003ecares about the family\u0027s well-being and reputation\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;and would like to protect it. This is suggested by her thoughts and actions after finding out her sister Lydia has run\u0026nbsp;away with Mr Wickham: \u0026ldquo;Lydia\u0026mdash;the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 192).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, even after she gets engaged with Darcy, she \u003cstrong\u003eremains dissatisfied with her family\u003c/strong\u003e and their behaviour in front of him: \u0026ldquo;Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification\u0026rdquo; (p. 270). This suggests she wants to avoid her family being judged by Darcy and wishes to control her family so their behaviour\u0026nbsp;will not\u0026nbsp;expose them as inferior to Darcy. Thus, \u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth is proud, too\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is often speculated that \u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth is the heroine that comes the closest to reflecting Jane Austen\u0027s own personality and views\u003c/strong\u003e. Particularly because of her liveliness, irony, and outspokenness. This comparison\u0026nbsp;is for instance based on letters written by Jane Austen to her friends and relatives. Her tone seem a lot like Lizzy\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022 data-guid=\u00225ddc4f0d-12e6-42c9-afbf-08d4cc738837\u0022\u003eRelationship with Darcy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth\u0026rsquo;s dislike for Darcy increases in Austen\u0027s \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice \u003c/em\u003eevery\u0026nbsp;time they meet until the Netherfield party departs for winter. Initially, Darcy hurts Elizabeth\u0027s\u0026nbsp;pride by calling her \u0026lsquo;tolerable\u0026rsquo;. This, combined with Darcy\u0026rsquo;s superior attitude, makes her \u003cstrong\u003ejudgemental and resentful towards him\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026nbsp;could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\u0026rdquo; (p. 13).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, seeing her mother acting silly\u0026nbsp;during the Netherfield ball makes Elizabeth feel \u003cstrong\u003eembarrassed \u003c/strong\u003eas she is hurt by what Darcy might be thinking about her family: \u0026ldquo;Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded\u0026rdquo; (p. 71).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen winter is over, Elizabeth and Mr Darcy\u0026nbsp;meet\u0026nbsp;at Rosings Park, his aunt\u0027s estate. When Darcy\u0026rsquo;s cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy prevented Bingley from marrying Jane by convincing him to return to London, Elizabeth is very \u003cstrong\u003eangry\u003c/strong\u003e. This is part of the reason why, when Darcy proposes, she immediately rejects him:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man\u0027s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. (pp. 132-133)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, when Darcy talks about the inferiority of her circumstances during his proposal, she offends him by suggesting his proposal was not gentleman-like and by accusing him of acting badly towards Wickham and her sister Jane: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;I might as well enquire,\u0026rsquo; replied she, \u0026lsquo;why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 133).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy\u0026rsquo;s ensuing explanatory letter makes Elizabeth angry at first. Furthermore, her \u003cstrong\u003eprejudice\u003c/strong\u003e makes her want to dismiss what he says in the letter: \u0026ldquo;With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield\u0026rdquo; (p. 142). The fact that she re-reads the letter and begins to take his arguments into account marks her change. It shows that she\u003cstrong\u003e is willing to change her perspective\u003c/strong\u003e and reevaluate her own judgmental behavior\u0026nbsp;and that she is sometimes \u003cstrong\u003einsightful about her own character\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;How despicably have I acted!\u0026rsquo; she cried; \u0026lsquo;I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities!\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 145).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore,\u003cstrong\u003e Darcy also reconsiders his attitudes\u003c/strong\u003e. Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s refusal shows Darcy that having superior social status is not\u0026nbsp;enough\u0026nbsp;and that happiness and openness are important:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\u0026rsquo; (p. 259)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Elizabeth sees Mr Darcy\u0026rsquo;s house and grounds at Pemberley\u0026nbsp;and hears a good account of his character from his servant, she starts to have\u003cstrong\u003e doubts about rejecting Darcy\u003c/strong\u003e. Later in the narrative, when Jane asks her when she first started to love Darcy, she replies: \u0026ldquo;I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\u0026rdquo; (p. 262). Although she is joking, her answer might have some truth in it, as\u0026nbsp;the beauty of the landscape at Pemberley, together with Darcy\u0027s servant\u0027s good account of him,\u0026nbsp;might have softened her prejudice towards the owner and prepared her for\u0026nbsp;falling in love with him. When Darcy\u0026nbsp;shows up unexpectedly\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003eElizabeth is\u0026nbsp;both \u003cstrong\u003eshamed\u003c/strong\u003e that he caught her visiting his house after rejecting his proposal (p. 174), although estates were generally open to visitors back then,\u0026nbsp;and \u003cstrong\u003eimpressed with the effort he makes\u003c/strong\u003e to come across as better-mannered and to treat her family in a nicer way (p. 176).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen her trip is cut short by Lydia eloping with Wickham, Elizabeth feels \u003cstrong\u003eguilty\u003c/strong\u003e for not exposing Wickham and not being open with her family:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;When I consider,\u0026rsquo; she added, in a yet more agitated voice, \u0026lsquo;that I might have prevented it! \u0026mdash; I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only \u0026mdash; some part of what I learnt \u0026mdash; to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now.\u0026rsquo; (p. 191)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is also the time when Elizabeth\u003cstrong\u003e feels she could fall in love with Darcy\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain\u0026rdquo; (p. 192). Elizabeth thinks the behaviour of Lydia will push Darcy away. In other words, it is only when Darcy becomes unavailable that Elizabeth begins to realise what she lost. Most of us can relate to this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the search for Lydia, Elizabeth spends a lot of time reflecting on her prejudices against Darcy and \u003cstrong\u003ebecomes more understanding\u003c/strong\u003e of his good aspects and\u0026nbsp;her own flaws:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling.\u0026nbsp;(p. 183)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Darcy and Bingley return to Longbourn, we see Elizabeth is \u003cstrong\u003ein love with Darcy\u003c/strong\u003e but has lost hope of them being together. She can\u0026rsquo;t understand his actions: \u0026ldquo;If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him\u0026rdquo; (p. 236).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her conversation\u0026nbsp;with Lady Catherine, Elizabeth also has the \u003cstrong\u003ecourage\u003c/strong\u003e to refuse not to promise to marry Darcy, suggesting her \u003cstrong\u003eindividualism\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.

She becomes able to recognise both her pride and\u0026nbsp;prejudices and learns not to be hasty about passing judgments on others. These changes are what makes it possible for her to fall in love with Darcy and eventually marry him.\u0026nbsp;Furthermore, her comments to him and her ability to criticise and laugh at him \u003cstrong\u003ehelp to make him a better man\u003c/strong\u003e.
