The plot structure of the novel fits&nbsp;<strong>the classical plot structure</strong> (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution), but it can also be analysed using other plot structures, dividing the story into <strong>three parts, each with its own plot line</strong>. In the latter interpretation, one plot focuses on Jane and Bingley, another on Lydia and Wickham, and the third (the main plot) involves Elizabeth and Darcy.</p><p>In what follows, we will give you the most important plot elements of the novel according to the classical plot structure.</p><h2 data-guid="1b362d49-c08e-4886-9a28-a320017be0b5" id="heading-2">Title</h2><p>The title reflects one of the main themes of this novel.<strong> </strong>Initially,<strong> Austen wanted to title the novel <em>First Impressions</em></strong>, because Darcy and Elizabeth misunderstand each other at first and form prejudiced ideas about each other. Their first impressions of each other&nbsp;change as the events of the plot unfold, and both begin to respect and eventually love each other.</p><p>However, Austen eventually settled on the title<i> Pride and Prejudice, </i>which is symbolic for some of the most dominant themes and attitudes in the plot. Most of the characters are proud or prejudiced at given points in the novel. For example, the Bennets and their acquaintances become prejudiced against Darcy because of Wickham&rsquo;s story about his alleged cruel mistreatment. Similarly, the Bingley sisters are prejudiced against the Bennets because of the inferiority of their social and economic status.</p><p><strong>The first definition of pride</strong> is pedantically offered&nbsp;by Mary in one of the early chapters: &ldquo;Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 13).</p><p>The two protagonists, <strong>Elizabeth and Darcy, reflect the title the most</strong>.&nbsp;In general, Darcy represents pride and Elizabeth represents prejudice. However, Austen shows that these character traits are never simple, as both characters have moments when they are both prejudiced and proud.</p><p>At first, Elizabeth is described as a prejudiced person, despite her being quite likable. She is prejudiced against Darcy because he comes across as an arrogant rich man who refuses to dance with her. Equally, Darcy is prejudiced against the Bennet family because he&nbsp;considers&nbsp;them inferior class-wise, just as he is prejudiced when he supposes&nbsp;that Jane&rsquo;s affection for Bingley is not very strong.</p><p>Darcy&rsquo;s pride initially creates&nbsp;distance between him Elizabeth, as he acts with superiority towards others. From the very beginning of the novel, he is described as &ldquo;the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world&rdquo; (p. 6). For example, it is Darcy&rsquo;s pride that makes him refuse to dance with Elizabeth in the beginning of the story. He then says: &ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt <em>me</em>&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 7). This is what triggers Elizabeth&rsquo;s prejudice against Darcy. But her prejudices come from her hurt pride: &ldquo;I could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine&rdquo; (p. 13). Austen, therefore, cleverly shows how pride and prejudice are often linked&nbsp;and also often misunderstood.</p><p>Another example of how pride and prejudice influence both characters is <strong>the marriage proposal</strong>. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth and talks about the inferiority of her social status, Elizabeth&rsquo;s pride is hurt by his prejudices. The same happens to Darcy when Elizabeth refuses his proposal&nbsp;and calls him ungentlemanly. Austen uses this to suggest how a person&rsquo;s pride can be hurt in many different ways&nbsp;and also how a person&rsquo;s prejudice against another can have different results (pp. 132-133).</p><p>However, they both begin to reconsider their attitudes. For example, Elizabeth&rsquo;s refusal shows Darcy that having superior social status is not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;and that happiness and openness are important. Darcy&rsquo;s letter in which he explains his views also makes Elizabeth reconsider both her pride and prejudice: &ldquo; &lsquo;How despicably I have acted!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;I, who have prided myself on my discernment!&rsquo; &rdquo; (p. 145).</p><h2 data-guid="633e8356-c4d2-4254-a54c-0c94c34814a5" id="heading-3">Beginning</h2><p>The novel begins with a <strong>narrative hook</strong> that hints at the whole plot: &ldquo;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife&rdquo; (p. 1). This famous opening line hints at an underlying&nbsp;conflict: although this &ldquo;universal truth&rdquo; may be obvious to some, the tone is also ironic. It points to some of the key themes of the novel, including the pursuit of marriage and the importance of money in marriage.&nbsp;Consequently, the opening lines&nbsp;<strong>foreshadow</strong>&nbsp;how the plot is going to be about marriage and the difficulties in achieving it.</p><p>The <strong>exposition</strong> continues by introducing the characters, namely the Bennet family, and their circumstances through dialogue. The <strong>inciting action</strong> that sets the action in motion is the fact that a&nbsp;rich bachelor, Mr Bingley, is coming to live in the area and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to marry one of her daughters off to him.</p><p><strong>A second inciting action</strong> can be found in the events of the country ball, when Darcy and Elizabeth meet and start disliking each other, mostly as a result of Darcy&rsquo;s pride when he refuses to dance with her: &ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt <em>me</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 7). Elizabeth's response to her first impression of Darcy is equally negative, which is seen by her words to her mother: &ldquo;I believe, ma'am,&nbsp;I may safely promise you <em>never</em> to dance with him&rdquo; (pp. 12-13). Both Darcy&rsquo;s rudeness and Elizabeth&rsquo;s strong attitude in response are <strong>foreshadowing</strong> elements that suggest their initial prejudiced feelings towards each other may change over the course of the novel.</p><h2 data-guid="5183951b-419d-4825-b057-c230483a0ccc" id="heading-4">Middle</h2><p>The middle of the novel develops the plot up to the crisis or climax. The <strong>rising action</strong> includes numerous events mostly involving the main characters, Darcy and Elizabeth. Here are some of the main episodes that add tension to the story and move the plot along.</p><p>After the ball, Jane goes to visit Miss&nbsp;Bingley in at Netherfield Park and catches a cold, bringing Elizabeth to the estate too. There, Darcy begins to be attracted by Elizabeth, against his wishes: &ldquo;Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger&rdquo; (p. 36).</p><p>Wickham&rsquo;s character is <strong>the element that complicates the plot</strong> as he tells lies to Elizabeth about Darcy, reinforcing her initial prejudices about him.</p><p>Yet another complication is the arrival&nbsp;of Mr Collins who wants to marry one of the Bennet girls and eventually proposes to Elizabeth who refuses him, creating a notable <strong>tension point</strong> in the plot:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Really, Mr. Collins,&rsquo; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, &lsquo;you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.&rsquo; (p. 77)</p></blockquote><p>The action moves forwards as Bingley is convinced by his friend and his sisters to leave Netherfield, while Mr. Collins ends up marrying&nbsp;Elizabeth&rsquo;s best friend Charlotte.&nbsp;This creates another <strong>tension point</strong>, as Elizabeth and Charlotte&rsquo;s views on marriage come into conflict. Elizabeth is disappointed in her friend.</p><p>Elizabeth goes to visit Charlotte where she comes into contact with Lady Catherine&nbsp;and sees Mr Darcy again. She secretly learns that Mr Darcy was key to the separation of Bingley and Jane, creating a significant <strong>conflict</strong>.</p><p>Darcy&rsquo;s backstories include his recount of Wickham seducing his sister but also what his housekeeper says about Darcy when Elizabeth visits his estate, Pemberley.</p><p>The<b> climax</b> comes when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth. Her angry and rather impolite refusal marks the high point in their conflict:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;I might as well inquire,&rsquo;&nbsp;replied she, &lsquo;why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I <em>was</em> uncivil?&rsquo;&nbsp;(p. 133)</p></blockquote><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="1d7d56ee-c4ce-4ad1-b9a0-5df733a0ecc8">Ending</h2><p>In the <strong>falling action</strong>, we see both Elizabeth and Darcy&nbsp;changing their attitudes. Darcy sends a letter in which he tries to explain his attitude which Elizabeth first receives angrily&nbsp;but which leads to her reconsidering her attitude towards him.&nbsp;<strong>The letter</strong> contains important <strong>backstories</strong> both about Darcy&rsquo;s actions and the true story of Mr Wickham. Elizabeth realises that Wickham lied about Darcy&nbsp;and also comes to understand his point of view regarding Bingley and Jane. Notably, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is one of the first English novels ever to use a letter to convey an important element of the plot.</p><p>The falling action also includes a backstory on the Bennet spouses as Elizabeth reflects on her parents&rsquo; failed relationship&nbsp;(p. 164). This suggests that her parents did not set a good example of marriage for Elizabeth and her sisters and that this probably influenced Elizabeth&rsquo;s views on love and marriage.</p><p>Elizabeth visits Pemberley and discovers a different, more amiable Darcy. Part of Darcy&rsquo;s qualities are discovered by Elizabeth thanks to the backstory about him and his family conveyed by the Pemberley housemaid. This represents an important <strong>turning point</strong> in the plot, as Elizabeth begins to change her opinion on&nbsp;him.</p><p>The moment when she discovers that Lydia has run away with Wickham marks an important <strong>tension point </strong>in the novel. Tension continues while Mr Bennet and Elizabeth&rsquo;s uncle look for Lydia.&nbsp;<strong>Suspense</strong> is created when they are found, as the family can&rsquo;t understand why Wickham would have agreed to marry Lydia in the circumstances.</p><p>However, Elizabeth then finds out, through another <strong>letter</strong> from her aunt, that Darcy is the one who has found&nbsp;Wickham and convinced&nbsp;him to marry Lydia so she could preserve her honour. Darcy has even paid for everything. This is another <strong>turning point</strong>, as Elizabeth&rsquo;s opinion of Darcy has now completely changed, although it seems to be too late: &ldquo;never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain&rdquo; (p. 192).</p><p>In <strong>the resolution,</strong> Darcy makes his final amends by bringing Bingley back to Longbourn&nbsp;after telling him that Jane loves him. This leads to Bingley finally proposing to Jane.</p><p>Just before the end, a final <strong>conflict</strong> is introduced through the visit of Lady Catherine who insults Elizabeth and accuses her of wanting to marry Darcy who - according to Lady Catherine - is engaged to his sickly cousin, Lady catherine's daughter. Elizabeth&rsquo;s refusal to deny this gives Darcy hope again.</p><p>After a number of minor&nbsp;<strong>tension points</strong> during his visits to the Bennet family, Darcy eventually resumes his proposal, and this time, she accepts. The story ends by giving readers an insight into the characters&rsquo; lives after Jane&rsquo;s and Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriages.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../analysis.html" title="Analysis of Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Analysis</span></a><a href="characters.html" title="Characters of Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Characters</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The plot structure of the novel fits\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ethe classical plot structure\u003c/strong\u003e (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution), but it can also be analysed using other plot structures, dividing the story into \u003cstrong\u003ethree parts, each with its own plot line\u003c/strong\u003e. In the latter interpretation, one plot focuses on Jane and Bingley, another on Lydia and Wickham, and the third (the main plot) involves Elizabeth and Darcy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn what follows, we will give you the most important plot elements of the novel according to the classical plot structure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00221b362d49-c08e-4886-9a28-a320017be0b5\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003eTitle\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe title reflects one of the main themes of this novel.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eInitially,\u003cstrong\u003e Austen wanted to title the novel \u003cem\u003eFirst Impressions\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, because Darcy and Elizabeth misunderstand each other at first and form prejudiced ideas about each other. Their first impressions of each other\u0026nbsp;change as the events of the plot unfold, and both begin to respect and eventually love each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Austen eventually settled on the title\u003ci\u003e Pride and Prejudice, \u003c/i\u003ewhich is symbolic for some of the most dominant themes and attitudes in the plot. Most of the characters are proud or prejudiced at given points in the novel. For example, the Bennets and their acquaintances become prejudiced against Darcy because of Wickham\u0026rsquo;s story about his alleged cruel mistreatment. Similarly, the Bingley sisters are prejudiced against the Bennets because of the inferiority of their social and economic status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe first definition of pride\u003c/strong\u003e is pedantically offered\u0026nbsp;by Mary in one of the early chapters: \u0026ldquo;Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 13).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two protagonists, \u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth and Darcy, reflect the title the most\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0026nbsp;In general, Darcy represents pride and Elizabeth represents prejudice. However, Austen shows that these character traits are never simple, as both characters have moments when they are both prejudiced and proud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first, Elizabeth is described as a prejudiced person, despite her being quite likable. She is prejudiced against Darcy because he comes across as an arrogant rich man who refuses to dance with her. Equally, Darcy is prejudiced against the Bennet family because he\u0026nbsp;considers\u0026nbsp;them inferior class-wise, just as he is prejudiced when he supposes\u0026nbsp;that Jane\u0026rsquo;s affection for Bingley is not very strong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy\u0026rsquo;s pride initially creates\u0026nbsp;distance between him Elizabeth, as he acts with superiority towards others. From the very beginning of the novel, he is described as \u0026ldquo;the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world\u0026rdquo; (p. 6). For example, it is Darcy\u0026rsquo;s pride that makes him refuse to dance with Elizabeth in the beginning of the story. He then says: \u0026ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 7). This is what triggers Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s prejudice against Darcy. But her prejudices come from her hurt pride: \u0026ldquo;I could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine\u0026rdquo; (p. 13). Austen, therefore, cleverly shows how pride and prejudice are often linked\u0026nbsp;and also often misunderstood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example of how pride and prejudice influence both characters is \u003cstrong\u003ethe marriage proposal\u003c/strong\u003e. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth and talks about the inferiority of her social status, Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s pride is hurt by his prejudices. The same happens to Darcy when Elizabeth refuses his proposal\u0026nbsp;and calls him ungentlemanly. Austen uses this to suggest how a person\u0026rsquo;s pride can be hurt in many different ways\u0026nbsp;and also how a person\u0026rsquo;s prejudice against another can have different results (pp. 132-133).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, they both begin to reconsider their attitudes. For example, Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s refusal shows Darcy that having superior social status is not\u0026nbsp;enough\u0026nbsp;and that happiness and openness are important. Darcy\u0026rsquo;s letter in which he explains his views also makes Elizabeth reconsider both her pride and prejudice: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;How despicably I have acted!\u0026rsquo; she cried; \u0026lsquo;I, who have prided myself on my discernment!\u0026rsquo; \u0026rdquo; (p. 145).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022633e8356-c4d2-4254-a54c-0c94c34814a5\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eBeginning\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novel begins with a \u003cstrong\u003enarrative hook\u003c/strong\u003e that hints at the whole plot: \u0026ldquo;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\u0026rdquo; (p. 1). This famous opening line hints at an underlying\u0026nbsp;conflict: although this \u0026ldquo;universal truth\u0026rdquo; may be obvious to some, the tone is also ironic. It points to some of the key themes of the novel, including the pursuit of marriage and the importance of money in marriage.\u0026nbsp;Consequently, the opening lines\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eforeshadow\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;how the plot is going to be about marriage and the difficulties in achieving it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eexposition\u003c/strong\u003e continues by introducing the characters, namely the Bennet family, and their circumstances through dialogue. The \u003cstrong\u003einciting action\u003c/strong\u003e that sets the action in motion is the fact that a\u0026nbsp;rich bachelor, Mr Bingley, is coming to live in the area and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to marry one of her daughters off to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA second inciting action\u003c/strong\u003e can be found in the events of the country ball, when Darcy and Elizabeth meet and start disliking each other, mostly as a result of Darcy\u0026rsquo;s pride when he refuses to dance with her: \u0026ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 7). Elizabeth\u0027s response to her first impression of Darcy is equally negative, which is seen by her words to her mother: \u0026ldquo;I believe, ma\u0027am,\u0026nbsp;I may safely promise you \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e to dance with him\u0026rdquo; (pp. 12-13). Both Darcy\u0026rsquo;s rudeness and Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s strong attitude in response are \u003cstrong\u003eforeshadowing\u003c/strong\u003e elements that suggest their initial prejudiced feelings towards each other may change over the course of the novel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00225183951b-419d-4825-b057-c230483a0ccc\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eMiddle\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe middle of the novel develops the plot up to the crisis or climax. The \u003cstrong\u003erising action\u003c/strong\u003e includes numerous events mostly involving the main characters, Darcy and Elizabeth. Here are some of the main episodes that add tension to the story and move the plot along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the ball, Jane goes to visit Miss\u0026nbsp;Bingley in at Netherfield Park and catches a cold, bringing Elizabeth to the estate too. There, Darcy begins to be attracted by Elizabeth, against his wishes: \u0026ldquo;Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger\u0026rdquo; (p. 36).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWickham\u0026rsquo;s character is \u003cstrong\u003ethe element that complicates the plot\u003c/strong\u003e as he tells lies to Elizabeth about Darcy, reinforcing her initial prejudices about him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet another complication is the arrival\u0026nbsp;of Mr Collins who wants to marry one of the Bennet girls and eventually proposes to Elizabeth who refuses him, creating a notable \u003cstrong\u003etension point\u003c/strong\u003e in the plot:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Really, Mr. Collins,\u0026rsquo; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \u0026lsquo;you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\u0026rsquo; (p. 77)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe action moves forwards as Bingley is convinced by his friend and his sisters to leave Netherfield, while Mr. Collins ends up marrying\u0026nbsp;Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s best friend Charlotte.\u0026nbsp;This creates another \u003cstrong\u003etension point\u003c/strong\u003e, as Elizabeth and Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s views on marriage come into conflict. Elizabeth is disappointed in her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth goes to visit Charlotte where she comes into contact with Lady Catherine\u0026nbsp;and sees Mr Darcy again. She secretly learns that Mr Darcy was key to the separation of Bingley and Jane, creating a significant \u003cstrong\u003econflict\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy\u0026rsquo;s backstories include his recount of Wickham seducing his sister but also what his housekeeper says about Darcy when Elizabeth visits his estate, Pemberley.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe\u003cb\u003e climax\u003c/b\u003e comes when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth. Her angry and rather impolite refusal marks the high point in their conflict:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;I might as well inquire,\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;replied she, \u0026lsquo;why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e uncivil?\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 133)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u00221d7d56ee-c4ce-4ad1-b9a0-5df733a0ecc8\u0022\u003eEnding\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003cstrong\u003efalling action\u003c/strong\u003e, we see both Elizabeth and Darcy\u0026nbsp;changing their attitudes. Darcy sends a letter in which he tries to explain his attitude which Elizabeth first receives angrily\u0026nbsp;but which leads to her reconsidering her attitude towards him.\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eThe letter\u003c/strong\u003e contains important \u003cstrong\u003ebackstories\u003c/strong\u003e both about Darcy\u0026rsquo;s actions and the true story of Mr Wickham. Elizabeth realises that Wickham lied about Darcy\u0026nbsp;and also comes to understand his point of view regarding Bingley and Jane. Notably, \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e is one of the first English novels ever to use a letter to convey an important element of the plot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe falling action also includes a backstory on the Bennet spouses as Elizabeth reflects on her parents\u0026rsquo; failed relationship\u0026nbsp;(p. 164). This suggests that her parents did not set a good example of marriage for Elizabeth and her sisters and that this probably influenced Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s views on love and marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth visits Pemberley and discovers a different, more amiable Darcy. Part of Darcy\u0026rsquo;s qualities are discovered by Elizabeth thanks to the backstory about him and his family conveyed by the Pemberley housemaid. This represents an important \u003cstrong\u003eturning point\u003c/strong\u003e in the plot, as Elizabeth begins to change her opinion on\u0026nbsp;him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe moment when she discovers that Lydia has run away with Wickham marks an important \u003cstrong\u003etension point \u003c/strong\u003ein the novel. Tension continues while Mr Bennet and Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s uncle look for Lydia.\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eSuspense\u003c/strong\u003e is created when they are found, as the family can\u0026rsquo;t understand why Wickham would have agreed to marry Lydia in the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Elizabeth then finds out, through another \u003cstrong\u003eletter\u003c/strong\u003e from her aunt, that Darcy is the one who has found\u0026nbsp;Wickham and convinced\u0026nbsp;him to marry Lydia so she could preserve her honour. Darcy has even paid for everything. This is another \u003cstrong\u003eturning point\u003c/strong\u003e, as Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s opinion of Darcy has now completely changed, although it seems to be too late: \u0026ldquo;never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain\u0026rdquo; (p. 192).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cstrong\u003ethe resolution,\u003c/strong\u003e Darcy makes his final amends by bringing Bingley back to Longbourn\u0026nbsp;after telling him that Jane loves him. This leads to Bingley finally proposing to Jane.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust before the end, a final \u003cstrong\u003econflict\u003c/strong\u003e is introduced through the visit of Lady Catherine who insults Elizabeth and accuses her of wanting to marry Darcy who - according to Lady Catherine - is engaged to his sickly cousin, Lady catherine\u0027s daughter. Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s refusal to deny this gives Darcy hope again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a number of minor\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003etension points\u003c/strong\u003e during his visits to the Bennet family, Darcy eventually resumes his proposal, and this time, she accepts. The story ends by giving readers an insight into the characters\u0026rsquo; lives after Jane\u0026rsquo;s and Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s marriages.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Structure of Pride and Prejudice","MetaDescription":"The plot focus of the novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is marriage and how it influenced the gentry middle and upper class in her time.
