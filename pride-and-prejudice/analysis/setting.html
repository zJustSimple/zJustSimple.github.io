The Regency Era is generally considered to refer to the period 1811-1820.</p><p>The time setting is approximately contemporary with&nbsp;the time of publication, as the novel was published in 1813.</p><h2 data-guid="5598b180-94ee-44e7-8552-8a13ada2a975" id="heading-2">Physical setting</h2><p>Jane Austen does not devote many descriptions to the physical setting. Although the events happen in a variety of places, these places are rarely described, the main exception being Mr&nbsp;Darcy&rsquo;s estate, Pemberley, where the physical setting takes on a particular significance. Austen&nbsp;even makes a direct note on her choice, emphasising&nbsp;the significance of one of the few places she does describe:</p><blockquote><p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. (p. 167)</p></blockquote><p>Through this observation, the author suggests that, from Elizabeth's trip, only Pemberley is important&nbsp;because of what it reveals about the male protagonist, Mr&nbsp;Darcy.</p><p>The physical setting includes references to both real places in England and imaginary ones. London, Hertfordshire, Brighton, and Derbyshire are real places in the UK. However, the estates and other towns mentioned are fictional: Longbourn, Netherfield, Meryton, Pemberley, Rosings, and Hunsford.</p><p>The novel opens in <strong>Longbourn,</strong> which is the estate of the Bennets, located somewhere in Hertfordshire, near the town of Meryton. None of these places is described in detail in the novel.&nbsp;</p><p>We only know that Lady Catherine thinks the estate has a &ldquo;small park&rdquo; (p. 246), as a way to say that the Bennets are socially inferior to her. She also continues to say that&nbsp;&ldquo;this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west&rdquo; (p. 246) and remark that &ldquo;there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn&rdquo; (p. 246). This suggests that the Bennets have modest living conditions compared to higher status people like Lady Catherine.</p><p>Part of the action takes place in <strong>Netherfield</strong>, a larger estate in Hertfordshire, rented by the wealthy Mr Bingley. This estate is not described in detail, but it is symbolic of class and superior status since&nbsp;only a very wealthy person would be able to&nbsp;rent it. However, note that the fact that Mr Bingley rents rather than owns Netherfield is symbolic of the fact that, while wealthy, he has not&nbsp;inherited an estate like true aristocracy:</p><blockquote><p>They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother&rsquo;s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</p><p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.&nbsp;(p. 10)</p></blockquote><p>Some of the action of the novel also takes place in <strong>Rosings,</strong> which is the estate of Darcy&rsquo;s aunt, Lady Catherine. Rosings is close to the <strong>town of Hunsford</strong> where Mr&nbsp;Collins lives. While the estate is not described in detail in the novel, we can assume it is very imposing as Lady Catherine is very wealthy. It is given the following simple description: &ldquo;It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground&rdquo; (p. 110). It also has large grounds where Elizabeth likes to walk. Elizabeth&rsquo;s experiences at Rosings are generally unpleasant, and the splendour of the house is used to reinforce Lady Catherine&rsquo;s condescension and her belief in her social superiority as an aristocrat.</p><p>At the same time, the Collins' house in Hunsford is the place where the climax takes places and Lizzy&nbsp;and Darcy are confronted with their own pride and prejudices (the proposal scene).</p><p>Another part of the action takes place in <strong>London</strong>. The Gardiners live in London and Jane visits them. Bingley and his sisters also have properties in London. Furthermore, Lydia and Wickham are found in London &ndash; where they also get married.</p><p><strong>Pemberley</strong> is the name of Mr. Darcy's estate in Derbyshire. Elizabeth visits the place with her aunt and uncle and meets Darcy there. It is the place where they move past their prejudices and develop a better relationship. Pemberley is also the only physical place that is described in more detail, using Elizabeth&rsquo;s perspective:</p><blockquote><p>The eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;&mdash;and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.&nbsp;(p. 169)</p></blockquote><p><strong>In comparison to the stiff formality of Rosings Park</strong>, Pemberley is depicted as being an exemplary and natural place. In particular, Pemberley estate is symbolic of Mr Darcy himself, who is subsequently revealed to be the perfect combination of upper-class values and social kindness and generosity.</p><p>At Pemberley, we see Elizabeth's feelings towards Darcy begin&nbsp;to change. She later jokes with Jane, saying she hardly knows when she began to love Darcy, but &ldquo;I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley&rdquo; (p. 262), she half-jokes. Although Jane initially doesn't believe her to be 'serious', what Elizabeth says is&nbsp;true in a way. By seeing Pemberley, she begins to understand Mr Darcy&rsquo;s character better.</p><p>In general, all the places in the novel are representative of&nbsp;their owners and the social class these owners&nbsp;belong to. <strong>We suggest you watch a couple of <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/pride-and-prejudice/perspectives/adaptations">film adaptations</a></strong> of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> to see how various directors have portrayed the differences in wealth between the families in the novel.</p><h2 data-guid="07b286d2-a334-4195-87e0-dc8e7aefb9b5" id="heading-3">Social setting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p><a name="_nr2g0qeb15vt"></a><a name="_6lkzszlqelc"></a><a name="_pkqwoeii2t6k"></a> <a name="_ftj697n75aws"></a>The social setting in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> explores numerous aspect of gentry life in <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;The Regency era refers to the time between 1811 and 1820 when King George III was considered unfit to rule, and his son ruled for him as Prince Regent.&lt;/p&gt;">Regency England</span>.</p><p><strong>The gentry</strong> refers to land-owning people who make money out of the land they own but don't have noble titles. In the story, the gentry class is represented by the Bennets, for example.&nbsp;The better part of the&nbsp;gentry is&nbsp;able to keep servants, as Mrs&nbsp;Bennet suggests at one point to Bingley: &ldquo;No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mincepies. For my part, Mr&nbsp;Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work.&rdquo; (p. 30).</p><p><strong>Of higher social status than the gentry</strong> are&nbsp;those who own&nbsp;big estates, rent&nbsp;houses in the city or the countryside, and keep&nbsp;more servants, but who do&nbsp;not have any&nbsp;titles,&nbsp;such as Mr&nbsp;Bingley.</p><p>Finally, there is&nbsp;<strong><span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;The social class who had titles and land that had been owned by their families for many generations.&lt;/p&gt;">the aristocracy</span></strong> &ndash; a rich hereditary ruling class. They have&nbsp;the most money as well as&nbsp;noble titles that are&nbsp;passed down from one generation to another. Lady Catherine, Darcy, and Colonel&nbsp;Fitzwilliam are part of the aristocracy.</p><p>Some upper class characteristics include: honour and respect; the pleasure of showing off your&nbsp;wealth and status such as letting tourists visit and often having guests to dinner;&nbsp;taking&nbsp;interest in arts, culture, and literature.</p><h3 id="heading-4">Regency England</h3><p>One of the first hints that the action takes place in Regency England is the presence of the <strong>military regiment</strong> in Meryton, which is an allusion to the wars with Napoleon in the early 1800s. In the novel, members of the army come from various levels of society&nbsp;as joining was voluntary. The militia acts as a disruptive force amongst the society of Meryton. However, note that the war itself is not discussed in the book, pointing to <strong>Austen&rsquo;s preoccupation with social rather than political issues</strong>. She is into love, not war.</p><p>Another typical aspect of Regency England present in the book is<strong> estate entailment</strong>, which meant that properties were often passed on to the next male relative in line, rather than to a property owner&rsquo;s wife or daughters. This is why Mr Collins will become the owner of Longbourn when Mr Bennet dies.</p><h3 id="heading-5">The difference between social classes</h3><p>The novel also explores the <strong>status and situation of different parts of the upper class. </strong>In particular, the novel deals with shifting relationships between the middle and upper classes in Jane Austen&rsquo;s era. Darcy&rsquo;s aunt Lady Catherine is part of the aristocracy&nbsp;and has the highest social status in the novel. However, her social rules are ridiculed by Austen, and the heroine Elizabeth fights against the rigidity of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s separation of the classes. Mr Darcy, by contrast, is an example of an ideal member of the upper class. While he has no title, Darcy has inherited his estate and comes from a partially aristocratic family. However, he learns to not act like Lady Catherine; he becomes polite and, by the end of the novel, learns to interact with the Bennets on equal terms, despite their upper-middle-class status.</p><p>It is significant that Darcy's initial sense of pride and prejudice is&nbsp;not directed towards the lower classes&nbsp;but towards <strong>the middle classes which were rising in this period</strong>. Elizabeth rightly fears that Darcy's strong objections&nbsp;to herself and her sister &ldquo;probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London&rdquo; (p. 131). You may say that it is easier to feel your position threatened by the class right below your own than a class at the very bottom of the social hierarchy.</p><p>Elizabeth's own upper-middle-class status, and the increasing significance of the middle classes in England at the time, is demonstrated best through her relation to Mr Darcy. <strong>Elizabeth's position as a tourist along with her aunt and uncle in Mr Darcy's house</strong> indicates her class, demonstrating the gap between herself and Mr Darcy. It simultaneously suggests the way in which the upper-middle classes were mingling more with the aristocracy during the period, and breaking down some of these barriers. There was a fascination with how the aristocracy lived, and whilst they might not live in anything&nbsp;as grand as Pemberley, there is no longer anything to stop them invading the upper-class sphere and viewing the house in the capacity of a tourist.</p><p>The novel suggests that inherited social status is not as important as character and politeness, while still maintaining a key distinction between the upper-middle-class gentry and the ordinary middle and lower classes.</p><h3 id="heading-6"><strong>Marriage a</strong>nd t<strong>he role of women in society</strong></h3><p>Two of the most important social aspects explored by <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> are marriage and the role of women in society.</p><p>In the setting of the novel, <strong>marriage seems to be an essential institution</strong>, at least from the perspective of women. Girls who are still teenagers are considered ready for marriage once they attend their first dance. However, they still need the permission of their parents or a male relative to get married. This is illustrated via the case of Lydia who is a minor and can only marry Wickham without consent if they were to go to Scotland, which was considered a popular place for romantic elopement in those days.</p><p>The novel suggests that most women&rsquo;s main concern was finding a suitable husband. This was because women, and particularly upper-middle or upper-class women, were not expected to find work or support themselves on their own. That would be unwomanly. You can read more about this in our <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/pride-and-prejudice/interpretation/message">Message</a> section.</p><p>This is demonstrated through the attitude of Mrs Bennet, who would go to great lengths&nbsp;to see her daughters married well. The fact that both Jane and&nbsp;Elizabeth&nbsp;marry men who are wealthier than they are&nbsp;shows how <strong>marriage was the only way for women to climb the social ladder</strong> and secure a better future for themselves.</p><p>The story explores a variety of marriages and wedding circumstances. Charlotte Lucas and Mr Collins&rsquo; marriage is not based on love (although Collins may <em>speak</em> of love). It is <strong>a marriage of convenience </strong>motivated by the desire to gain property and a higher social rank. Charlotte suggests a particularly <strong>pragmatic view towards marriage</strong>: &ldquo;Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.&rdquo; (p. 87)</p><p>Mr and Mrs Bennet&rsquo;s <strong>marriage was based on physical attraction</strong>, as Mrs Bennet used to be a beautiful woman. Blinded by Mrs Bennet&rsquo;s looks, Mr Bennet overlooked her character flaws. This is why, after more than 20 years of marriage, the husband is often annoyed by his wife and chooses to ignore her (pp. 2-3). Theirs is an example of <strong>a failed marriage</strong> which also ends up affecting the education of their children. The Bennet sisters did not receive the social and intellectual education they needed from neither of their parents.</p><p>The marriages of Jane and&nbsp;Bingley and Elizabeth and Darcy show how like-minded individuals can develop <strong>a good</strong> <strong>marriage, based on love and respect</strong>. However, both couples must (of course!) first overcome obstacles. Jane and Bingley are too passive and too influenced by others, whereas Darcy and Elizabeth must first overcome the prejudices they have about each other. Darcy is prejudiced against Lizzie&rsquo;s social status, and she is prejudiced against his pride and character. Once they manage to overcome false impressions and review their own behaviour, they are able realise that they are actually the best match for each other. <strong>Their marriage also breaks the social norms</strong>, as indicated by Lady Catherine who opposes the idea because of Elizabeth&rsquo;s apparently inferior status.</p><p>Lydia and Wickham&rsquo;s story exemplify what was considered <strong>a shameful, bad&nbsp; marriage</strong>. Wickham runs away with her without any intention to marry, because he believes she is not wealthy enough for him. He is in fact just taking advantage of her sexually, which might very well have led to Lydia becoming a so-called fallen woman, which would be the ruin of her reputation. The fact that he is only persuaded to marry her by money shows his bad&nbsp;character. Furthermore, the story suggests that their marriage is never happy as they quickly lose interest in one another but have to stay married. Their story is also very relevant for <strong>how important public image was for families</strong> as we see Elizabeth thinking that the shame they brought on her family will lead to her and Jane never getting married.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/analysis/characters/mr-mrs-bennet" title="Characterisation of Mr &amp; Mrs Bennet from Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Mr &amp; Mrs Bennet</span></a><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/analysis/narrator-and-point-of-view" title="Narrator and point of view of Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Narrator and point of view</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The Regency Era is generally considered to refer to the period 1811-1820.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe time setting is approximately contemporary with\u0026nbsp;the time of publication, as the novel was published in 1813.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00225598b180-94ee-44e7-8552-8a13ada2a975\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003ePhysical setting\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane Austen does not devote many descriptions to the physical setting. Although the events happen in a variety of places, these places are rarely described, the main exception being Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy\u0026rsquo;s estate, Pemberley, where the physical setting takes on a particular significance. Austen\u0026nbsp;even makes a direct note on her choice, emphasising\u0026nbsp;the significance of one of the few places she does describe:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. (p. 167)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough this observation, the author suggests that, from Elizabeth\u0027s trip, only Pemberley is important\u0026nbsp;because of what it reveals about the male protagonist, Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe physical setting includes references to both real places in England and imaginary ones. London, Hertfordshire, Brighton, and Derbyshire are real places in the UK. However, the estates and other towns mentioned are fictional: Longbourn, Netherfield, Meryton, Pemberley, Rosings, and Hunsford.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novel opens in \u003cstrong\u003eLongbourn,\u003c/strong\u003e which is the estate of the Bennets, located somewhere in Hertfordshire, near the town of Meryton. None of these places is described in detail in the novel.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe only know that Lady Catherine thinks the estate has a \u0026ldquo;small park\u0026rdquo; (p. 246), as a way to say that the Bennets are socially inferior to her. She also continues to say that\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west\u0026rdquo; (p. 246) and remark that \u0026ldquo;there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn\u0026rdquo; (p. 246). This suggests that the Bennets have modest living conditions compared to higher status people like Lady Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of the action takes place in \u003cstrong\u003eNetherfield\u003c/strong\u003e, a larger estate in Hertfordshire, rented by the wealthy Mr Bingley. This estate is not described in detail, but it is symbolic of class and superior status since\u0026nbsp;only a very wealthy person would be able to\u0026nbsp;rent it. However, note that the fact that Mr Bingley rents rather than owns Netherfield is symbolic of the fact that, while wealthy, he has not\u0026nbsp;inherited an estate like true aristocracy:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\u0026rsquo;s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\u0026nbsp;(p. 10)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the action of the novel also takes place in \u003cstrong\u003eRosings,\u003c/strong\u003e which is the estate of Darcy\u0026rsquo;s aunt, Lady Catherine. Rosings is close to the \u003cstrong\u003etown of Hunsford\u003c/strong\u003e where Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins lives. While the estate is not described in detail in the novel, we can assume it is very imposing as Lady Catherine is very wealthy. It is given the following simple description: \u0026ldquo;It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground\u0026rdquo; (p. 110). It also has large grounds where Elizabeth likes to walk. Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s experiences at Rosings are generally unpleasant, and the splendour of the house is used to reinforce Lady Catherine\u0026rsquo;s condescension and her belief in her social superiority as an aristocrat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the Collins\u0027 house in Hunsford is the place where the climax takes places and Lizzy\u0026nbsp;and Darcy are confronted with their own pride and prejudices (the proposal scene).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother part of the action takes place in \u003cstrong\u003eLondon\u003c/strong\u003e. The Gardiners live in London and Jane visits them. Bingley and his sisters also have properties in London. Furthermore, Lydia and Wickham are found in London \u0026ndash; where they also get married.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePemberley\u003c/strong\u003e is the name of Mr. Darcy\u0027s estate in Derbyshire. Elizabeth visits the place with her aunt and uncle and meets Darcy there. It is the place where they move past their prejudices and develop a better relationship. Pemberley is also the only physical place that is described in more detail, using Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s perspective:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;\u0026mdash;and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.\u0026nbsp;(p. 169)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn comparison to the stiff formality of Rosings Park\u003c/strong\u003e, Pemberley is depicted as being an exemplary and natural place. In particular, Pemberley estate is symbolic of Mr Darcy himself, who is subsequently revealed to be the perfect combination of upper-class values and social kindness and generosity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Pemberley, we see Elizabeth\u0027s feelings towards Darcy begin\u0026nbsp;to change. She later jokes with Jane, saying she hardly knows when she began to love Darcy, but \u0026ldquo;I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley\u0026rdquo; (p. 262), she half-jokes. Although Jane initially doesn\u0027t believe her to be \u0027serious\u0027, what Elizabeth says is\u0026nbsp;true in a way. By seeing Pemberley, she begins to understand Mr Darcy\u0026rsquo;s character better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, all the places in the novel are representative of\u0026nbsp;their owners and the social class these owners\u0026nbsp;belong to. \u003cstrong\u003eWe suggest you watch a couple of \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/pride-and-prejudice/perspectives/adaptations\u0022\u003efilm adaptations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e of \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e to see how various directors have portrayed the differences in wealth between the families in the novel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002207b286d2-a334-4195-87e0-dc8e7aefb9b5\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eSocial setting\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_nr2g0qeb15vt\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_6lkzszlqelc\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_pkqwoeii2t6k\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca name=\u0022_ftj697n75aws\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe social setting in \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e explores numerous aspect of gentry life in \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Regency era refers to the time between 1811 and 1820 when King George III was considered unfit to rule, and his son ruled for him as Prince Regent.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0022\u003eRegency England\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe gentry\u003c/strong\u003e refers to land-owning people who make money out of the land they own but don\u0027t have noble titles. In the story, the gentry class is represented by the Bennets, for example.\u0026nbsp;The better part of the\u0026nbsp;gentry is\u0026nbsp;able to keep servants, as Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet suggests at one point to Bingley: \u0026ldquo;No, she would go home.

Lady Catherine, Darcy, and Colonel\u0026nbsp;Fitzwilliam are part of the aristocracy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome upper class characteristics include: honour and respect; the pleasure of showing off your\u0026nbsp;wealth and status such as letting tourists visit and often having guests to dinner;\u0026nbsp;taking\u0026nbsp;interest in arts, culture, and literature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eRegency England\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first hints that the action takes place in Regency England is the presence of the \u003cstrong\u003emilitary regiment\u003c/strong\u003e in Meryton, which is an allusion to the wars with Napoleon in the early 1800s. In the novel, members of the army come from various levels of society\u0026nbsp;as joining was voluntary. The militia acts as a disruptive force amongst the society of Meryton. However, note that the war itself is not discussed in the book, pointing to \u003cstrong\u003eAusten\u0026rsquo;s preoccupation with social rather than political issues\u003c/strong\u003e. She is into love, not war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother typical aspect of Regency England present in the book is\u003cstrong\u003e estate entailment\u003c/strong\u003e, which meant that properties were often passed on to the next male relative in line, rather than to a property owner\u0026rsquo;s wife or daughters. This is why Mr Collins will become the owner of Longbourn when Mr Bennet dies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022\u003eThe difference between social classes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novel also explores the \u003cstrong\u003estatus and situation of different parts of the upper class. \u003c/strong\u003eIn particular, the novel deals with shifting relationships between the middle and upper classes in Jane Austen\u0026rsquo;s era. Darcy\u0026rsquo;s aunt Lady Catherine is part of the aristocracy\u0026nbsp;and has the highest social status in the novel. However, her social rules are ridiculed by Austen, and the heroine Elizabeth fights against the rigidity of Lady Catherine\u0026rsquo;s separation of the classes. Mr Darcy, by contrast, is an example of an ideal member of the upper class. While he has no title, Darcy has inherited his estate and comes from a partially aristocratic family. However, he learns to not act like Lady Catherine; he becomes polite and, by the end of the novel, learns to interact with the Bennets on equal terms, despite their upper-middle-class status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is significant that Darcy\u0027s initial sense of pride and prejudice is\u0026nbsp;not directed towards the lower classes\u0026nbsp;but towards \u003cstrong\u003ethe middle classes which were rising in this period\u003c/strong\u003e. Elizabeth rightly fears that Darcy\u0027s strong objections\u0026nbsp;to herself and her sister \u0026ldquo;probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London\u0026rdquo; (p. 131). You may say that it is easier to feel your position threatened by the class right below your own than a class at the very bottom of the social hierarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth\u0027s own upper-middle-class status, and the increasing significance of the middle classes in England at the time, is demonstrated best through her relation to Mr Darcy. \u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth\u0027s position as a tourist along with her aunt and uncle in Mr Darcy\u0027s house\u003c/strong\u003e indicates her class, demonstrating the gap between herself and Mr Darcy. It simultaneously suggests the way in which the upper-middle classes were mingling more with the aristocracy during the period, and breaking down some of these barriers. There was a fascination with how the aristocracy lived, and whilst they might not live in anything\u0026nbsp;as grand as Pemberley, there is no longer anything to stop them invading the upper-class sphere and viewing the house in the capacity of a tourist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novel suggests that inherited social status is not as important as character and politeness, while still maintaining a key distinction between the upper-middle-class gentry and the ordinary middle and lower classes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarriage a\u003c/strong\u003end t\u003cstrong\u003ehe role of women in society\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo of the most important social aspects explored by \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e are marriage and the role of women in society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the setting of the novel, \u003cstrong\u003emarriage seems to be an essential institution\u003c/strong\u003e, at least from the perspective of women. Girls who are still teenagers are considered ready for marriage once they attend their first dance. However, they still need the permission of their parents or a male relative to get married. This is illustrated via the case of Lydia who is a minor and can only marry Wickham without consent if they were to go to Scotland, which was considered a popular place for romantic elopement in those days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novel suggests that most women\u0026rsquo;s main concern was finding a suitable husband. This was because women, and particularly upper-middle or upper-class women, were not expected to find work or support themselves on their own. That would be unwomanly. You can read more about this in our \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.studienet.se/pride-and-prejudice/interpretation/message\u0022\u003eMessage\u003c/a\u003e section.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is demonstrated through the attitude of Mrs Bennet, who would go to great lengths\u0026nbsp;to see her daughters married well. The fact that both Jane and\u0026nbsp;Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;marry men who are wealthier than they are\u0026nbsp;shows how \u003cstrong\u003emarriage was the only way for women to climb the social ladder\u003c/strong\u003e and secure a better future for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story explores a variety of marriages and wedding circumstances. Charlotte Lucas and Mr Collins\u0026rsquo; marriage is not based on love (although Collins may \u003cem\u003espeak\u003c/em\u003e of love). It is \u003cstrong\u003ea marriage of convenience \u003c/strong\u003emotivated by the desire to gain property and a higher social rank. Charlotte suggests a particularly \u003cstrong\u003epragmatic view towards marriage\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.\u0026rdquo; (p. 87)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr and Mrs Bennet\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003emarriage was based on physical attraction\u003c/strong\u003e, as Mrs Bennet used to be a beautiful woman. Blinded by Mrs Bennet\u0026rsquo;s looks, Mr Bennet overlooked her character flaws. This is why, after more than 20 years of marriage, the husband is often annoyed by his wife and chooses to ignore her (pp. 2-3). Theirs is an example of \u003cstrong\u003ea failed marriage\u003c/strong\u003e which also ends up affecting the education of their children. The Bennet sisters did not receive the social and intellectual education they needed from neither of their parents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe marriages of Jane and\u0026nbsp;Bingley and Elizabeth and Darcy show how like-minded individuals can develop \u003cstrong\u003ea good\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003emarriage, based on love and respect\u003c/strong\u003e. However, both couples must (of course!) first overcome obstacles. Jane and Bingley are too passive and too influenced by others, whereas Darcy and Elizabeth must first overcome the prejudices they have about each other. Darcy is prejudiced against Lizzie\u0026rsquo;s social status, and she is prejudiced against his pride and character. Once they manage to overcome false impressions and review their own behaviour, they are able realise that they are actually the best match for each other. \u003cstrong\u003eTheir marriage also breaks the social norms\u003c/strong\u003e, as indicated by Lady Catherine who opposes the idea because of Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s apparently inferior status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLydia and Wickham\u0026rsquo;s story exemplify what was considered \u003cstrong\u003ea shameful, bad\u0026nbsp; marriage\u003c/strong\u003e. Wickham runs away with her without any intention to marry, because he believes she is not wealthy enough for him. He is in fact just taking advantage of her sexually, which might very well have led to Lydia becoming a so-called fallen woman, which would be the ruin of her reputation. The fact that he is only persuaded to marry her by money shows his bad\u0026nbsp;character. Furthermore, the story suggests that their marriage is never happy as they quickly lose interest in one another but have to stay married. Their story is also very relevant for \u003cstrong\u003ehow important public image was for families\u003c/strong\u003e as we see Elizabeth thinking that the shame they brought on her family will lead to her and Jane never getting married.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Setting of Pride and Prejudice","MetaDescription":"The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is set in Regency England, and the plot develops over the course of almost two years.
