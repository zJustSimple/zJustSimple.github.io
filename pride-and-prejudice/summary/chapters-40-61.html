However, she does not share the part about Darcy influencing Bingley not to marry Jane. When Jane hears about Wickham, she is shocked. The sisters decide not to reveal the truth about Wickham in the community because he is leaving soon. Elizabeth also notices that Jane is still suffering because of Mr&nbsp;Bingley.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="75586eb8-5b75-4f8a-8d10-61b05ca5036a">Chapter 41</h2><p>Kitty and Lydia start pressuring their father to take them to Brighton. Soon, Lydia is invited to Brighton by Mrs&nbsp;Forster, the colonel&rsquo;s young wife. Mr&nbsp;Bennet agrees despite Elizabeth warning him that Lydia will become even more frivolous and a danger to her own reputation and the reputation of her sisters. Mr&nbsp;Bennet does not care for such trivial matters and besides thinks that Lydia is too poor for the soldiers to be interested in her.</p><p>In the meantime, Elizabeth still meets Wickham occasionally before the officers leave. He tries to charm her again, but she is bothered by his attitude. At a party before the officers leave, Elizabeth finally suggests to Wickham that she knows the truth of his past, and he begins to avoid her. The next morning, the regiment leaves for Brighton, along with Lydia and the Forsters.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="84b3869a-f185-42d3-ab16-1635085868b7">Chapter 42</h2><p>We learn that Mr&nbsp;Bennet was initially attracted by Mrs&nbsp;Bennet&rsquo;s beauty when he chose to marry her. However, as he discovered her&nbsp;poor intellect, the husband started losing interest in his wife. Reflecting on her parents&rsquo; marriage, Elizabeth realises their relationship has influenced their daughters negatively. She also finds her father responsible for not using his education to teach his daughters to be more respectable.</p><p>During the next weeks, Kitty and Mrs&nbsp;Bennet whine about wanting to go to Brighton as well. Elizabeth takes comfort in her upcoming trip with her uncle and aunt.&nbsp;However, when the time comes, Mrs&nbsp;Gardiner announces a change in the plan, as Mr&nbsp;Gardiner does not have enough time to go to the Lake District as originally planned, and their tour will be restricted to Derbyshire instead.</p><p>On the way, Elizabeth and the Gardiners stop in a village near Darcy&rsquo;s estate, Pemberley. Elizabeth is worried about meeting Darcy&nbsp;but learns that he is not at home. She then agrees to visit the house the next day, as visiting wealthy people's manors was quite common then.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="372da2ac-fc39-45ff-8f8c-6e0f1dbd07c9"><a name="_3zznpks6hudf"></a>Chapter 43</h2><p>Seeing how beautiful the house and grounds of Pemberley are, Elizabeth starts imagining what it would be like to be the mistress of the estate and slightly regrets rejecting Darcy&rsquo;s proposal. Mrs&nbsp;Reynolds, the housekeeper, gives the party a tour of the mansion and talks highly of Darcy and Georgiana. Mrs&nbsp;Reynolds&rsquo; praise makes Elizabeth reconsider Darcy&rsquo;s character and personality.</p><p>Elizabeth and Mr&nbsp;Darcy suddenly meet, as Darcy&nbsp;has arrived earlier than expected. He is polite and attentive, but they are both awkward&nbsp;and Elizabeth is very embarrassed at him seeing her at his house. Before they leave the estate, Mr&nbsp;Darcy returns, asking to meet the Gardiners and inviting Mr&nbsp;Gardiner to fish in his lake. As the party walks together, Elizabeth tells Darcy she did not want to intrude in his home, but&nbsp;Darcy invites her to come and meet his sister the next day. The Gardiners are impressed by Darcy&rsquo;s manners, but not knowing the full story they still believe he is responsible for Wickham&rsquo;s bad fortune. Elizabeth cannot reveal her source to them but hints&nbsp;that the negative stories about Darcy&nbsp;might not be true.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="c1b41108-350a-4e79-bb0a-6e2c0e9ce6e9">Chapter 44</h2><p>The next day, Elizabeth meets Georgiana and realises that both of them want to make a good impression on each other. Bingley also joins the group, and Elizabeth is reminded of how pleasant he is. The Gardiners observe Darcy&rsquo;s behaviour and realise that he is in love with Elizabeth.</p><p>Elizabeth notices that there is no romantic affection between Bingley and Georgiana, despite Caroline Bingley's claims. Furthermore, Bingley asks Elizabeth about Jane, apparently suggesting he regrets not seeing her. Darcy invites Elizabeth and her uncle and aunt to dine at his estate. In the meantime, the Gardiners learn on their own that Wickham has a bad reputation in the area and start appreciating Darcy more.</p><p>During that&nbsp;night, Elizabeth reflects on her feelings for Darcy. She is not sure that she loves him, but she is impressed by his change of character and by the fact that&nbsp;he still seems to love her despite her rude rejection.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="049fe1a5-e78a-4250-bc0d-22df30242070">Chapter 45</h2><p>The next day, Mrs&nbsp;Gardiner and Elizabeth visit Georgiana at Pemberley. The Bingley sisters are also present, but they say very little. Secretly, Elizabeth hopes Darcy will join them, but she is also nervous about it. When he joins the group, Caroline Bingley tries to make the situation uncomfortable for Elizabeth by asking rude questions about the militia and Elizabeth's sisters. Elizabeth avoids their trap, conscious that the topic is an allusion to Wickham, whom Darcy detests, and that it is a painful topic for both&nbsp;Mr. Darcy and his sister.</p><p>When Elizabeth and her aunt leave, Caroline tries to criticise Elizabeth in front of Georgiana, but Georgiana&nbsp;is not impressed by her comments. Caroline also provokes Mr&nbsp;Darcy into stating that he believes Elizabeth to be beautiful.</p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="248bf2a3-08db-4734-800b-524e505435fb">Chapter 46</h2><p>At the inn, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane which reveal the shocking news that Lydia has run away with Wickham and that there is little to suggest that Wickham intends to marry her. Jane wants Elizabeth to return home with the Gardiners immediately, so that Mr&nbsp;Gardiner might help Mr&nbsp;Bennet search for Lydia.</p><p>Darcy arrives to find Elizabeth deeply distressed, and she ends up telling&nbsp;him the whole scandaous affair with Lydia and Wickham. Elizabeth regrets not exposing Wickham&rsquo;s character publicly, and she begins to realise that the shame Lydia has now brought on the family will make it impossible for Darcy to ask her to marry him again despite his feelings. Too late, she realises that she actually loves him. Darcy leaves as the Gardiners return to the inn.</p><h2 id="heading-8" data-guid="ea45cf3b-758b-4886-a99e-6bacace6ecab">Chapter 47</h2><p>On the way home to Longbourn, Mr&nbsp;Gardiner tries to comfort Elizabeth by arguing that Wickham will probably marry Lydia, but Elizabeth&nbsp;is sceptical. She regrets not telling her family the truth about Wickham before.</p><p>Back at Longbourn, there is no news of Lydia, and Jane informs Elizabeth that Mr&nbsp;Bennet went to London to search for her in an uncharacteristic display of drive. Mr&nbsp;Gardiner offers to help with the search. Jane and Elizabeth discuss the whole situation when they are alone.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-9" data-guid="ef7e2772-559a-44f3-8cc5-5a4741c53189">Chapter 48</h2><p>Mr&nbsp;Gardiner sets off for London while Mrs&nbsp;Gardiner stays in Longbourn to help the girls, as Mrs&nbsp;Bennet refuses to leave her room and is very distressed. Mr&nbsp;Collins sends a letter to Mr&nbsp;Bennet sternly arguing that he should reject Lydia for what she has done.</p><p>A letter from Mr&nbsp;Gardiner informs the Bennets that they have made little progress with the search&nbsp;but that Wickham has plenty of gambling debts. Mr&nbsp;Bennet returns home, and he finally agrees with Elizabeth that he should pay more attention to his daughters&rsquo; behaviour, admitting to some of his failures.</p><h2 id="heading-10" data-guid="703b2eef-d91a-42e4-a021-b09415473f19">Chapter 49</h2><p>A couple of days later, a letter from Mr&nbsp;Gardiner arrives saying that he has found out where the couple is and that Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for a relatively small sum of money. Elizabeth cannot believe that Wickham has agreed to the marriage, while Mr&nbsp;Bennet thinks Mr&nbsp;Gardiner must have paid a significant additional sum of money to Wickham. Mrs&nbsp;Bennet hears the news and starts happily planning the wedding, not worrying about money or reputation.</p><h2 id="heading-11" data-guid="8765591c-6f76-4610-ba6a-fdda645bb75f">Chapter 50</h2><p>Mr&nbsp;Bennet wants to find out how much money he owes Mr&nbsp;Gardiner. He also feels guilty about not saving more money for his daughters&rsquo; dowries. As Mrs&nbsp;Bennet becomes more excited about the wedding and talks about Wickham and Lydia moving to a house nearby, Mr&nbsp;Bennet makes it clear that he does not want them in the neighbourhood and claims that he will not allow them to visit Longbourn. A letter comes informing the Bennets that Wickham will take a new position in the army, where he will be based far away, in the North of England. Jane and Elizabeth manage to convince their father to allow for their sister and Wickham to visit before leaving for the North.</p><p>At the same time, Elizabeth becomes more convinced than ever that she has no chance of marrying Darcy&nbsp;since Wickham (whom Darcy despises) is now part of her family.</p><h2 id="heading-12" data-guid="eef3f73c-edc8-455c-9fea-8074f63466c3">Chapter 51</h2><p>During their visit to Longbourn, Lydia and her husband act like they have done nothing wrong, annoying Jane and Elizabeth with their behaviour. When Lydia tells Elizabeth about her wedding, she mentions Darcy being there and then remembers she was not supposed to mention this aspect. Fascinated but unable to ask Lydia, Elizabeth writes to her aunt asking about Darcy&rsquo;s unexpected involvement in the whole affair.</p><h2 id="heading-13" data-guid="3ef7ddb8-56e3-4df2-8304-ac87792a8702">Chapter 52</h2><p>Mrs&nbsp;Gardiner&rsquo;s reply reveals that Darcy was the one who found Wickham and Lydia&nbsp;and that he tried to persuade Lydia to leave Wickham, but she refused. As a result, Darcy offered Wickham money to marry Lydia and kept the whole deal secret, insisting that Mr&nbsp;Gardiner take credit for it. Mrs&nbsp;Gardiner argues Darcy did this out of love for Elizabeth and that he is a perfect match for her.</p><h2 id="heading-14" data-guid="b4692082-0295-49c0-9331-c12cdec4285f">Chapter 53</h2><p>After Lydia and Wickham&rsquo;s departure, news that Mr Bingley will soon return to Netherfield spreads fast. When Jane hears about it, she claims she is over him, but Elizabeth hopes they will reconnect. Mrs&nbsp;Bennet is even more excited, planning to invite Bingley for dinner.</p><p>When Bingley and Darcy return, they visit the family at Longbourn, and Elizabeth is once again embarrassed by her mother&rsquo;s behaviour. Mrs&nbsp;Bennet treats Darcy coldly and brags about Lydia&rsquo;s marriage&nbsp;while being overly attentive to&nbsp;Bingley. However, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet invites both Bingley and Darcy to dinner.</p><h2 id="heading-15" data-guid="aa1397cc-e53c-434e-96f7-7fdf58598b96">Chapter 54</h2><p>At dinner, Bingley sits next to Jane, while Darcy and Elizabeth are seated away from each other. Elizabeth would really like to speak to him, but the circumstances prevent it. Darcy also announces that he is leaving for London but returning some days later.</p><h2 id="heading-16" data-guid="01ee9a12-cf0f-4827-9715-4505c26d0c87">Chapter 55</h2><p>Bingley continues to visit the Bennet family. Mrs&nbsp;Bennet&rsquo;s schemes to leave Bingley alone with Jane fail at first. However, one morning she manages to leave them alone in the drawing room where Bingley finally proposes, admitting that he has been in love with her the whole time. Elizabeth walks in, and Bingley leaves to talk to Mr&nbsp;Bennet. Jane reveals her happiness and soon informs the family about the proposal, resulting in general satisfaction.</p><h2 id="heading-17" data-guid="0297e7d1-c670-4d97-a713-fbcabe2e90a8">Chapter 56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The next morning, Lady Catherine de Bourgh pays an unexpected visit to the Bennets and asks to speak to Elizabeth privately. During a walk, Lady Catherine rudely questions Elizabeth about her rumoured engagement to Mr&nbsp;Darcy. When Elizabeth denies any plans of&nbsp;marriage, Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise she will never marry Darcy. Elizabeth angrily refuses and leaves.</p><h2 id="heading-18" data-guid="537fc8e8-5b78-47f0-bd92-2fdab645b4d5">Chapter 57</h2><p>Lady Catherine&rsquo;s visits and inquiries make Elizabeth anxious. She worries that Lady Catherine will tell Darcy what happened, and she thinks this will further convince Darcy not to propose again. In the meantime, Mr&nbsp;Collins writes to Mr&nbsp;Bennet about Lady Catherine&rsquo;s suspicions and advises&nbsp;him not to let Elizabeth upset her. When Mr&nbsp;Bennet talks to Elizabeth about it, he laughs at the rumours, believing that Mr&nbsp;Darcy and his daughter hate each other. Elizabeth tries to laugh too, but it secretly upsets her.</p><h2 id="heading-19" data-guid="a40f1d4e-235f-4736-b3ee-165edccc9c1e">Chapter 58</h2><p>Darcy returns to the area and visits the Bennets with Bingley. The Bennet sisters and the men go for a walk during which Darcy and Elizabeth end up walking alone. She reveals that she knows about his role in saving Lydia and thanks him sincerely. Darcy admits that he did it out of love for Elizabeth. He repeats his marriage proposal and Elizabeth now happily accepts. He reveals that he decided to propose again after Lady Catherine told him about Elizabeth's refusal to never marry him.</p><p>They both apologise for how they acted during the first proposal. Darcy admits that he was&nbsp;reserved and arrogant. Elizabeth admits she was prejudiced against him. Darcy also accepts that he was wrong about Jane and Bingley when he separated them and reveals that he encouraged Bingley to return to Jane this time.</p><h2 id="heading-20" data-guid="47d64183-7ffa-4a9c-a514-a862c0dd8c59">Chapter 59</h2><p>In the evening, Elizabeth tells Jane about her conversation with Darcy. Jane does not believe her at first, as she is sure Elizabeth hates&nbsp;him, but Elizabeth&nbsp;manages to convince her that she does love&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Darcy. When Bingley and Darcy visit the Bennets the next morning, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet asks Elizabeth to take Mr&nbsp;Darcy for a walk so that Jane and Bingley can be alone. During the walk, they agree that Darcy will ask Mr&nbsp;Bennet for Elizabeth&rsquo;s hand in marriage&nbsp;that evening.</p><p>After Mr&nbsp;Bennet has spoken with Darcy, he demands to talk to his daughter alone. Not knowing Darcy's real character, he tries to talk her out of accepting the proposal. Mr Bennet does not want his favourite daughter trapped in a bad marriage like himself. However,&nbsp;Elizabeth convinces her father that she is indeed in love, and he finally agrees to&nbsp;the advantageous marriage. Mrs&nbsp;Bennet is equally shocked by the news, but quickly changes her attitude towards Darcy because of his wealth, which is even greater than Bingley's.</p><h2 id="heading-21" data-guid="fe1095a3-9d8a-477b-ad47-3d5ccf3bb70b">Chapter 60</h2><p>Darcy and Elizabeth talk some more about how they fell in love. Then&nbsp;they both send letters to others to inform them about their future marriage. Elizabeth writes to the Gardiners while Darcy writes to Lady Catherine and his sister. The news upsets Lady Catherine so badly that Mr&nbsp;Collins and Charlotte need to stay with Charlotte&rsquo;s parents for a while because of Lady Catherine's anger. After the weddings, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet seems very happy and proud.</p><h2 id="heading-22" data-guid="82963b8e-26fe-4813-965e-7c70fe375f07">Chapter 61</h2><p>The narrator&nbsp;describes to us how Mr&nbsp;Bennet misses Elizabeth and visits her often, and how Bingley and Jane decide&nbsp;to move further away from Longbourn and settle within a relatively short distance of Pemberley where Elizabeth and Darcy live.</p><p>Kitty spends more time with her married sisters and learns to behave better, while Mary stays at home with Mrs&nbsp;Bennet and also improves, becoming less bookish. Lydia asks Elizabeth to influence Darcy to give Wickham more money, but she refuses. Instead, Jane and Elizabeth send Lydia money from their allowances. Elizabeth and Georgiana become friends while Elizabeth also encourages Darcy to resume his relationship with his aunt, Lady Catherine.</p><p>Darcy and Elizabeth also maintain a close relationship with the Gardiners,&nbsp;who&nbsp;made their turning point encounter at Pemberley,&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;their marriage,&nbsp;possible.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/summary/chapters-20-39" title="Summary of Chapters 20-39 of Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Chapters 20-39</span></a><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/background-information" title="Background information | Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Background information</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, she does not share the part about Darcy influencing Bingley not to marry Jane. When Jane hears about Wickham, she is shocked. The sisters decide not to reveal the truth about Wickham in the community because he is leaving soon. Elizabeth also notices that Jane is still suffering because of Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u002275586eb8-5b75-4f8a-8d10-61b05ca5036a\u0022\u003eChapter 41\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eKitty and Lydia start pressuring their father to take them to Brighton. Soon, Lydia is invited to Brighton by Mrs\u0026nbsp;Forster, the colonel\u0026rsquo;s young wife. Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet agrees despite Elizabeth warning him that Lydia will become even more frivolous and a danger to her own reputation and the reputation of her sisters. Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet does not care for such trivial matters and besides thinks that Lydia is too poor for the soldiers to be interested in her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, Elizabeth still meets Wickham occasionally before the officers leave. He tries to charm her again, but she is bothered by his attitude. At a party before the officers leave, Elizabeth finally suggests to Wickham that she knows the truth of his past, and he begins to avoid her. The next morning, the regiment leaves for Brighton, along with Lydia and the Forsters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002284b3869a-f185-42d3-ab16-1635085868b7\u0022\u003eChapter 42\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe learn that Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet was initially attracted by Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet\u0026rsquo;s beauty when he chose to marry her. However, as he discovered her\u0026nbsp;poor intellect, the husband started losing interest in his wife. Reflecting on her parents\u0026rsquo; marriage, Elizabeth realises their relationship has influenced their daughters negatively. She also finds her father responsible for not using his education to teach his daughters to be more respectable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the next weeks, Kitty and Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet whine about wanting to go to Brighton as well. Elizabeth takes comfort in her upcoming trip with her uncle and aunt.\u0026nbsp;However, when the time comes, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Gardiner announces a change in the plan, as Mr\u0026nbsp;Gardiner does not have enough time to go to the Lake District as originally planned, and their tour will be restricted to Derbyshire instead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the way, Elizabeth and the Gardiners stop in a village near Darcy\u0026rsquo;s estate, Pemberley. Elizabeth is worried about meeting Darcy\u0026nbsp;but learns that he is not at home. She then agrees to visit the house the next day, as visiting wealthy people\u0027s manors was quite common then.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022372da2ac-fc39-45ff-8f8c-6e0f1dbd07c9\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_3zznpks6hudf\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eChapter 43\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeeing how beautiful the house and grounds of Pemberley are, Elizabeth starts imagining what it would be like to be the mistress of the estate and slightly regrets rejecting Darcy\u0026rsquo;s proposal. Mrs\u0026nbsp;Reynolds, the housekeeper, gives the party a tour of the mansion and talks highly of Darcy and Georgiana. Mrs\u0026nbsp;Reynolds\u0026rsquo; praise makes Elizabeth reconsider Darcy\u0026rsquo;s character and personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth and Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy suddenly meet, as Darcy\u0026nbsp;has arrived earlier than expected. He is polite and attentive, but they are both awkward\u0026nbsp;and Elizabeth is very embarrassed at him seeing her at his house. Before they leave the estate, Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy returns, asking to meet the Gardiners and inviting Mr\u0026nbsp;Gardiner to fish in his lake. As the party walks together, Elizabeth tells Darcy she did not want to intrude in his home, but\u0026nbsp;Darcy invites her to come and meet his sister the next day. The Gardiners are impressed by Darcy\u0026rsquo;s manners, but not knowing the full story they still believe he is responsible for Wickham\u0026rsquo;s bad fortune. Elizabeth cannot reveal her source to them but hints\u0026nbsp;that the negative stories about Darcy\u0026nbsp;might not be true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022c1b41108-350a-4e79-bb0a-6e2c0e9ce6e9\u0022\u003eChapter 44\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Elizabeth meets Georgiana and realises that both of them want to make a good impression on each other. Bingley also joins the group, and Elizabeth is reminded of how pleasant he is. The Gardiners observe Darcy\u0026rsquo;s behaviour and realise that he is in love with Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth notices that there is no romantic affection between Bingley and Georgiana, despite Caroline Bingley\u0027s claims. Furthermore, Bingley asks Elizabeth about Jane, apparently suggesting he regrets not seeing her. Darcy invites Elizabeth and her uncle and aunt to dine at his estate. In the meantime, the Gardiners learn on their own that Wickham has a bad reputation in the area and start appreciating Darcy more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring that\u0026nbsp;night, Elizabeth reflects on her feelings for Darcy. She is not sure that she loves him, but she is impressed by his change of character and by the fact that\u0026nbsp;he still seems to love her despite her rude rejection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022049fe1a5-e78a-4250-bc0d-22df30242070\u0022\u003eChapter 45\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Gardiner and Elizabeth visit Georgiana at Pemberley. The Bingley sisters are also present, but they say very little. Secretly, Elizabeth hopes Darcy will join them, but she is also nervous about it. When he joins the group, Caroline Bingley tries to make the situation uncomfortable for Elizabeth by asking rude questions about the militia and Elizabeth\u0027s sisters.
