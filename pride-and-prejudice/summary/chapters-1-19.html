Mrs&nbsp;Bennet wants him to marry one of her&nbsp;five daughters and urges her husband to&nbsp;pay Bingley a visit as soon as he arrives. Mr&nbsp;Bennet jokes about his wife&rsquo;s desperation&nbsp;and teases her by saying he sees no need&nbsp;to visit Bingley. He mentions that Elizabeth is his favourite daughter because she is more intelligent than the others, but Mrs&nbsp;Bennett mostly seems focused on her children's looks.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="e432e9ef-9fce-4b30-96af-d4ab0016d6e0"><a name="_mjnkl6zbj0cz"></a>Chapter 2</h2><p>Without telling his family, Mr&nbsp;Bennet pays a visit to&nbsp;Bingley. Later, he has the satisfaction of informing his wife about the visit and continues to tease her and his daughters.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="9361a4be-37f5-4fd4-a50a-fec8d41daadc">Chapter 3</h2><p>Mr&nbsp;Bennet refuses to give his family any details about Mr&nbsp;Bingley, so Mrs&nbsp;Bennet gains some information from their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Mr&nbsp;Bingley also comes to see Mr&nbsp;Bennet, but the women in the family are not present. Bingley is invited for dinner, but he refuses as he needs to pick up friends from London to attend the upcoming ball in Meryton, the local town.</p><p>At the ball, the sisters and Mrs&nbsp;Bennet finally meet&nbsp;Bingley as well as&nbsp;his two&nbsp;sisters and his friend Mr&nbsp;Darcy. The Bennet sisters find Darcy arrogant because he refuses to dance. When Bingley suggests that Darcy dance with Elizabeth, Darcy refuses and makes an offensive remark about her. Elizabeth overhears him and is outraged by his attitude, but is able to laugh&nbsp;about it with her friends&nbsp;afterwards.</p><p>Everyone likes Bingley, all the more when he ends up dancing most of the night with Jane Bennet. At home, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet excitedly tries to describe the ball to Mr&nbsp;Bennet, who quickly gets irritated by her descriptions of such trivia.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="e319b457-755e-42c0-88df-3e33ada992c5">Chapter 4</h2><p>In confidence, Jane admits to Elizabeth that she likes&nbsp;Bingley. Elizabeth approves, but warns her against being too naïve and seeing only the good in people. Elizabeth also talks about how snobbish the Bingley sisters are, but Jane prefers to see them as charming.</p><p>The narrator reveals that Bingley is very wealthy and a long-time friend of&nbsp;Darcy. However, while Bingley is open and sociable, Darcy is more reserved. Darcy disliked the ball and even argues that Jane smiled too much. However, Bingley&rsquo;s sisters seem to approve of Jane.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="a6cf4d17-f010-4e4f-b986-b32b937cedc8">Chapter 5</h2><p>We are introduced to the Lucas family, who live near Longbourn. Sir William Lucas made his money in trade&nbsp;but is very proud that he has since been knighted. Sir William and Lady Lucas&rsquo; eldest daughter Charlotte is Elizabeth&rsquo;s closest friend.</p><p>Lady Lucas and her daughter visit the Bennet women the day after the ball and talk about the evening. They all think that&nbsp;Bingley is attracted to Jane and that Darcy is unlikable and proud. Mary Bennet, who likes to read, pedantically argues that pride is related to what people think of themselves, and vanity is about how people want others to see them.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="504261c5-b607-407e-a90c-2807b7d036ea">Chapter 6</h2><p>Through various social occasions, the Bingley sisters get to know Jane and Elizabeth better. They like Jane, but they strongly dislike the rest of the family. The Bennet sisters also get to meet Bingley and Darcy a few more times.</p><p>Charlotte and Elizabeth talk about Jane&rsquo;s affection for Bingley, with Charlotte arguing that Jane should actively show Bingley that she likes him. She pragmatically believes this is the best way to attract a man and that happiness in marriage is a matter of luck. Elizabeth does not agree.</p><p>Gradually, Elizabeth&rsquo;s intelligence and charms begin to attract Darcy. At one party, he overhears Elizabeth and Sir William Lucas talking. Sir William Lucas encourages her to dance with Darcy, but she refuses. Darcy praises Elizabeth&rsquo;s appearance to Caroline Bingley, who begins mocking the Bennet family and joking about Darcy&rsquo;s future marriage to the inferior Elizabeth, which she&nbsp;believes to be impossible.</p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="69569536-aa97-4d1f-9d7d-1bef2c80925a">Chapter 7</h2><p>The narrator describes the entail on Mr&nbsp;Bennet&rsquo;s estate, a legal requirement made on the property which means that it can only pass to male heirs. Therefore, upon Mr&nbsp;Bennet&rsquo;s death, his estate will go to a distant male relative, rather than to his wife and daughters who will then have to find another home and will not have a lot of money.</p><p>We are told that Lydia and Kitty frequently go to see their aunt in Meryton. They start to go particularly frequently when the militia are quartered in the town, as they enjoy flirting with the army officers. Mr&nbsp;Bennet disagrees with their behaviour, although he does little to prevent it, whereas his wife does not see the girls&rsquo; attitude as a problem at all.</p><p>Jane is invited to dine at Netherfield with the Bingley sisters. Her mother sends her on horseback, cunningly hoping that it will rain so&nbsp;Jane will need to spend the night there. Although she dislikes the trick, Jane agrees to go on horseback. She reaches the mansion soaking wet and catches a cold. The Bingley sisters invite her to stay until she gets better.</p><p>Elizabeth walks through muddy fields to Netherfield to see her sister. When she arrives, her dress is covered with mud, to the shock of the posh Bingley sisters, although Darcy likes how Elizabeth looks after exercise. As Jane is feeling worse, Elizabeth also agrees to stay at Netherfield.</p><h2 id="heading-8" data-guid="f33121a2-e161-4ef3-a269-5b2afbd3ee15">Chapter 8</h2><p>When Elizabeth goes to take care of Jane in her room, the group at Netherfield begin talking about her. Caroline is critical of what she sees as Elizabeth&rsquo;s pride while Bingley and Darcy appreciate her dedication to taking care of Jane. The Bingley sisters also mock the poor connections of&nbsp;the Bennet family. Darcy agrees that the low social status of the Bennets will make it hard for the girls to find wealthy or upper-class husbands.</p><p>Elizabeth rejoins the party, and they all start discussing&nbsp;what it means to be an accomplished woman. She and Darcy have different opinions about the topic and argue passionately, with Elizabeth arguing that Darcy&rsquo;s criteria for an accomplished woman are unrealistic. When she goes to visit Jane again, she finds that she is worse, and Bingley intends to send for a doctor in the morning.</p><h2 id="heading-9" data-guid="f7fc752c-5cf5-438b-a81a-cdb3ac500b6f">Chapter 9</h2><p>At Elizabeth&rsquo;s request, Mr&nbsp;Bingley sends a note inviting Mrs&nbsp;Bennet to come and see Jane. The mother is happy to see that Jane will recover but hopes to prolong the girl&rsquo;s stay at Netherfield in the hope of getting Bingley as her son-in-law. In conversation with the Netherfield group, she is rude to Darcy and everyone sees her intentions to marry Jane&nbsp;to Bingley. Elizabeth is embarrassed by her mother's behaviour and by her sister Lydia, who cheekily asks Mr&nbsp;Bingley to hold a ball at Netherfield. Elizabeth&nbsp;is relieved when she and her family leave the estate.</p><h2 id="heading-10" data-guid="2d0ce93f-4fac-4dd2-9044-992afdfa058e">Chapter 10</h2><p>In the evening, Darcy, Elizabeth, and the Bingleys gather in the drawing room. Caroline tries to flatter Darcy by commenting on his writing style, but Darcy does not respond to her flirtation. Miss Bingley and Mr Darcy mock and criticise Mr&nbsp;Bingley for being so accommodating with others, but Elizabeth defends him. She and Darcy argue again over this&nbsp;topic. Elizabeth notices that Darcy looks at her more often, but she assumes he does it because he disapproves of her. When the Netherfield people&nbsp;are alone the next day, Caroline &ndash; who has also noticed Darcy&rsquo;s looks towards Elizabeth &ndash; mocks Darcy about marrying into a common family.</p><h2 id="heading-11" data-guid="e98c07ca-e855-4ec4-8e33-d9d9bfdf887e">Chapter 11</h2><p>Later, Jane joins the party in the drawing room. Elizabeth is happy to see Mr&nbsp;Bingley paying attention to Jane. Caroline continues to tease Darcy while&nbsp;professing&nbsp;a false love for reading to impress him. She walks around the room to attract Darcy&rsquo;s attention, but Darcy only looks up when she invites Elizabeth to walk with her. The party starts talking about Darcy&rsquo;s character, and Darcy admits that he can be resentful and that once his good opinion of someone is lost, it is lost forever. Elizabeth scolds Darcy for refusing&nbsp;to change his opinion of others. At the end of the chapter, we get the&nbsp;sense that Darcy is falling for Elizabeth.</p><h2 id="heading-12" data-guid="3245b027-c41e-46b9-92f8-7f837f875039">Chapter 12</h2><p>Elizabeth sends her mother a letter to ask for a carriage to collect them from Netherfield Park, but Mrs&nbsp;Bennet refuses because she secretly wants Jane to stay longer in Mr&nbsp;Bingley's company. However, the sisters borrow Bingley&rsquo;s carriage. Mr&nbsp;Bingley is sad to see the girls go, but the others at Netherfield are relieved. Darcy is happy to no longer be tempted by Elizabeth, while Caroline is happy to see her competition leave.</p><h2 id="heading-13" data-guid="42bd0712-5670-4233-b763-ee7720c5bbb4">Chapter 13</h2><p>At Longbourn, Mr&nbsp;Bennet tells his family that he has received a letter from his young cousin Mr&nbsp;Collins who is coming&nbsp;to see&nbsp;them. Because&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;and Mrs&nbsp;Bennet do&nbsp;not have any sons, Collins will&nbsp;inherit the estate when Mr&nbsp;Bennet dies, even though he is only a distant relative. Although none of them has met him before, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet resents him instantly. His letter also states that he recently became a clergyman, and it is also full of excessive praise for Lady Catherine de Bourgh, his patroness.</p><p>When Collins arrives, he comes across as young, pompous, and formally mannered. He claims to understand&nbsp;that him inheriting the estate must not be easy for the family and suggests that he could make amends by marrying one of the Bennet girls.</p><h2 id="heading-14" data-guid="543685b3-b138-405c-a9f8-d3d8cf0a2eb6">Chapter 14</h2><p>After dinner, Mr&nbsp;Collins starts talking about Lady Catherine de Bourgh, suggesting that he delights in flattering her and her daughter with carefully crafted compliments. Mr&nbsp;Collins is invited to read aloud, and he chooses to read from a book of sermons, as he never reads novels. When Lydia gets bored and interrupts him,&nbsp;Collins is offended. The rest of the family apologises, but Mr&nbsp;Collins stops reading and the group switches to a game.</p><h2 id="heading-15" data-guid="15997a5a-1235-4816-bcde-3a79677f99be">Chapter 15<a name="_y0w7e88mo9tf"></a></h2><p>We learn that Mr&nbsp;Collins is not well-educated and that he feels lucky to have found a wealthy sponsor such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh. As a result, he is both humble and proud at the same time. As he came to visit the Bennets with an intention to marry, he first picks out&nbsp;Jane. However, when he learns that Jane is likely to get engaged soon, he quickly&nbsp;shifts his attention to Elizabeth.</p><p>Collins and the young Bennet women walk to Meryton. On the way, they meet a young&nbsp;officer who knows Lydia and Kitty and who introduces them to a friend of his, Mr&nbsp;Wickham. Bingley and Darcy also happen to pass the group. Elizabeth notices&nbsp;that there is&nbsp;tension between Darcy and Wickham.</p><p>Mr&nbsp;Collins and the girls reach their aunt, Mrs&nbsp;Philips, who invites them to dinner the next day.</p><h2 id="heading-16" data-guid="4fb4f3f9-4ae0-439d-8c63-70a9a98eaea9"><a name="_wybp0f3swwpi"></a>Chapter 16</h2><p>At dinner at Mrs&nbsp;Philips&rsquo;, the Bennet sisters meet Mr&nbsp;Wickham again, and he and Elizabeth start chatting. When Elizabeth makes her disdain for Darcy known, Wickham also reveals his past connection with Darcy. He claims Darcy&rsquo;s father was a good man who intended for Wickham to become a clergyman on one of the Darcy family&rsquo;s estates and to receive a sum of money on his death. However, Wickham says&nbsp;that when Darcy&rsquo;s father died, Darcy refused to follow&nbsp;his late father&rsquo;s wishes. Wickham argues that Darcy was driven by jealousy because Darcy&rsquo;s father liked Wickham more, despite the fact that Wickham was only the son of one of the late Darcy's employees.</p><p>Elizabeth is shocked and thinks Wickham should make the whole affair public. Wickham refuses, arguing he does not want to also dishonour the memory of Mr&nbsp;Darcy&rsquo;s father. Wickham also talks about how protective Darcy is of his sister Georgiana, whom Wickham describes as&nbsp;proud and disagreeable, and of&nbsp;the fact that Darcy is supposed to marry Lady Catherine de Bourgh&rsquo;s daughter.</p><h2 id="heading-17" data-guid="d82bec57-8048-4fde-8bd9-f18d9eccb770">Chapter 17</h2><p>Elizabeth tells Jane what she found out from Wickham, but Jane, characteristically, does not want to think badly of either Darcy or Wickham. She likes to think there has simply been a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bingleys announce they will hold a ball at their estate, and they invite the Bennets. Mr&nbsp;Collins wants to join the ball and asks Elizabeth to save some dances for him. Soon, she realises that Mr Collins probably wants to marry her and tries to put him off through her attitude.</p><h2 id="heading-18" data-guid="a30a9ae2-89b1-4fa1-b031-8b507bd6b486">Chapter 18</h2><p>The night of the ball, Elizabeth is disappointed to find out that Wickham will not attend and suspects he wanted to avoid Mr&nbsp;Darcy. She dances with Collins as promised&nbsp;but is embarrassed by his poor dancing skills. When Darcy suddenly invites her to dance as well, Elizabeth is so surprised that she accepts.</p><p>During the dance, Elizabeth tries to provoke Darcy by talking about his character and making allusions to Wickham. While they are dancing, Sir William Lucas hints at the general expectation that Jane will marry Bingley. Afterwards, Darcy and Elizabeth part in silence, dissatisfied.</p><p>Caroline Bingley warns Elizabeth not to trust Mr&nbsp;Wickham, but she cannot give any details and comes off as snobbish, so Elizabeth angrily rejects her. She then discovers from Jane that Bingley - like Caroline - believes that Wickham is the one who is in the wrong, but Elizabeth&nbsp;does not believe this either.</p><p>Jane spends most of the evening with Bingley, to Elizabeth&rsquo;s joy. However, Elizabeth&nbsp;finds herself embarrassed by the other members of her family. When Collins discovers that Darcy is his patroness&rsquo; nephew, he clumsily goes over to introduces himself, disregarding social etiquette. Mrs&nbsp;Bennet talks loudly about the prospective engagement between Jane and Bingley, and Darcy overhears her. Mary plays the piano badly, her father intervenes indelicately, and Mr&nbsp;Collins makes an embarrassing speech. At the end of the evening, Mrs&nbsp;Bennet invites Mr&nbsp;Bingley to dine at their household. He accepts&nbsp;but says he first needs to go to London.</p><h2 id="heading-19" data-guid="58f2f129-d5f1-42a8-8a2e-8af2ba45d5ea">Chapter 19</h2><p>The following day, Collins asks Elizabeth to marry him through a very long speech. When Elizabeth bluntly refuses him, he still refuses to believe her, saying that she must be playing hard to get. When she continues to refuse and he continues to insist, Elizabeth leaves the room.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../summary.html" title="Summary of Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Summary</span></a><a href="chapters-20-39.html" title="Summary of Chapters 20-39 of Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Chapters 20-39</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet wants him to marry one of her\u0026nbsp;five daughters and urges her husband to\u0026nbsp;pay Bingley a visit as soon as he arrives. Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet jokes about his wife\u0026rsquo;s desperation\u0026nbsp;and teases her by saying he sees no need\u0026nbsp;to visit Bingley. He mentions that Elizabeth is his favourite daughter because she is more intelligent than the others, but Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennett mostly seems focused on her children\u0027s looks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e432e9ef-9fce-4b30-96af-d4ab0016d6e0\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_mjnkl6zbj0cz\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eChapter 2\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout telling his family, Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet pays a visit to\u0026nbsp;Bingley. Later, he has the satisfaction of informing his wife about the visit and continues to tease her and his daughters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00229361a4be-37f5-4fd4-a50a-fec8d41daadc\u0022\u003eChapter 3\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr\u0026nbsp;Bennet refuses to give his family any details about Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley, so Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet gains some information from their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley also comes to see Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet, but the women in the family are not present. Bingley is invited for dinner, but he refuses as he needs to pick up friends from London to attend the upcoming ball in Meryton, the local town.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the ball, the sisters and Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet finally meet\u0026nbsp;Bingley as well as\u0026nbsp;his two\u0026nbsp;sisters and his friend Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy. The Bennet sisters find Darcy arrogant because he refuses to dance. When Bingley suggests that Darcy dance with Elizabeth, Darcy refuses and makes an offensive remark about her. Elizabeth overhears him and is outraged by his attitude, but is able to laugh\u0026nbsp;about it with her friends\u0026nbsp;afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone likes Bingley, all the more when he ends up dancing most of the night with Jane Bennet. At home, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet excitedly tries to describe the ball to Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet, who quickly gets irritated by her descriptions of such trivia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e319b457-755e-42c0-88df-3e33ada992c5\u0022\u003eChapter 4\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn confidence, Jane admits to Elizabeth that she likes\u0026nbsp;Bingley. Elizabeth approves, but warns her against being too naïve and seeing only the good in people. Elizabeth also talks about how snobbish the Bingley sisters are, but Jane prefers to see them as charming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator reveals that Bingley is very wealthy and a long-time friend of\u0026nbsp;Darcy. However, while Bingley is open and sociable, Darcy is more reserved. Darcy disliked the ball and even argues that Jane smiled too much. However, Bingley\u0026rsquo;s sisters seem to approve of Jane.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a6cf4d17-f010-4e4f-b986-b32b937cedc8\u0022\u003eChapter 5\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are introduced to the Lucas family, who live near Longbourn. Sir William Lucas made his money in trade\u0026nbsp;but is very proud that he has since been knighted. Sir William and Lady Lucas\u0026rsquo; eldest daughter Charlotte is Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s closest friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLady Lucas and her daughter visit the Bennet women the day after the ball and talk about the evening. They all think that\u0026nbsp;Bingley is attracted to Jane and that Darcy is unlikable and proud. Mary Bennet, who likes to read, pedantically argues that pride is related to what people think of themselves, and vanity is about how people want others to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022504261c5-b607-407e-a90c-2807b7d036ea\u0022\u003eChapter 6\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough various social occasions, the Bingley sisters get to know Jane and Elizabeth better. They like Jane, but they strongly dislike the rest of the family. The Bennet sisters also get to meet Bingley and Darcy a few more times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCharlotte and Elizabeth talk about Jane\u0026rsquo;s affection for Bingley, with Charlotte arguing that Jane should actively show Bingley that she likes him. She pragmatically believes this is the best way to attract a man and that happiness in marriage is a matter of luck. Elizabeth does not agree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGradually, Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s intelligence and charms begin to attract Darcy. At one party, he overhears Elizabeth and Sir William Lucas talking. Sir William Lucas encourages her to dance with Darcy, but she refuses. Darcy praises Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s appearance to Caroline Bingley, who begins mocking the Bennet family and joking about Darcy\u0026rsquo;s future marriage to the inferior Elizabeth, which she\u0026nbsp;believes to be impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022 data-guid=\u002269569536-aa97-4d1f-9d7d-1bef2c80925a\u0022\u003eChapter 7\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator describes the entail on Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet\u0026rsquo;s estate, a legal requirement made on the property which means that it can only pass to male heirs. Therefore, upon Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet\u0026rsquo;s death, his estate will go to a distant male relative, rather than to his wife and daughters who will then have to find another home and will not have a lot of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are told that Lydia and Kitty frequently go to see their aunt in Meryton. They start to go particularly frequently when the militia are quartered in the town, as they enjoy flirting with the army officers. Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet disagrees with their behaviour, although he does little to prevent it, whereas his wife does not see the girls\u0026rsquo; attitude as a problem at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane is invited to dine at Netherfield with the Bingley sisters. Her mother sends her on horseback, cunningly hoping that it will rain so\u0026nbsp;Jane will need to spend the night there. Although she dislikes the trick, Jane agrees to go on horseback. She reaches the mansion soaking wet and catches a cold. The Bingley sisters invite her to stay until she gets better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth walks through muddy fields to Netherfield to see her sister. When she arrives, her dress is covered with mud, to the shock of the posh Bingley sisters, although Darcy likes how Elizabeth looks after exercise. As Jane is feeling worse, Elizabeth also agrees to stay at Netherfield.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-8\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f33121a2-e161-4ef3-a269-5b2afbd3ee15\u0022\u003eChapter 8\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Elizabeth goes to take care of Jane in her room, the group at Netherfield begin talking about her. Caroline is critical of what she sees as Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s pride while Bingley and Darcy appreciate her dedication to taking care of Jane. The Bingley sisters also mock the poor connections of\u0026nbsp;the Bennet family. Darcy agrees that the low social status of the Bennets will make it hard for the girls to find wealthy or upper-class husbands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth rejoins the party, and they all start discussing\u0026nbsp;what it means to be an accomplished woman. She and Darcy have different opinions about the topic and argue passionately, with Elizabeth arguing that Darcy\u0026rsquo;s criteria for an accomplished woman are unrealistic. When she goes to visit Jane again, she finds that she is worse, and Bingley intends to send for a doctor in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-9\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f7fc752c-5cf5-438b-a81a-cdb3ac500b6f\u0022\u003eChapter 9\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s request, Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley sends a note inviting Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet to come and see Jane. The mother is happy to see that Jane will recover but hopes to prolong the girl\u0026rsquo;s stay at Netherfield in the hope of getting Bingley as her son-in-law. In conversation with the Netherfield group, she is rude to Darcy and everyone sees her intentions to marry Jane\u0026nbsp;to Bingley. Elizabeth is embarrassed by her mother\u0027s behaviour and by her sister Lydia, who cheekily asks Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley to hold a ball at Netherfield. Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;is relieved when she and her family leave the estate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-10\u0022 data-guid=\u00222d0ce93f-4fac-4dd2-9044-992afdfa058e\u0022\u003eChapter 10\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the evening, Darcy, Elizabeth, and the Bingleys gather in the drawing room. Caroline tries to flatter Darcy by commenting on his writing style, but Darcy does not respond to her flirtation. Miss Bingley and Mr Darcy mock and criticise Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley for being so accommodating with others, but Elizabeth defends him. She and Darcy argue again over this\u0026nbsp;topic. Elizabeth notices that Darcy looks at her more often, but she assumes he does it because he disapproves of her. When the Netherfield people\u0026nbsp;are alone the next day, Caroline \u0026ndash; who has also noticed Darcy\u0026rsquo;s looks towards Elizabeth \u0026ndash; mocks Darcy about marrying into a common family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-11\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e98c07ca-e855-4ec4-8e33-d9d9bfdf887e\u0022\u003eChapter 11\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater, Jane joins the party in the drawing room. Elizabeth is happy to see Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley paying attention to Jane. Caroline continues to tease Darcy while\u0026nbsp;professing\u0026nbsp;a false love for reading to impress him. She walks around the room to attract Darcy\u0026rsquo;s attention, but Darcy only looks up when she invites Elizabeth to walk with her. The party starts talking about Darcy\u0026rsquo;s character, and Darcy admits that he can be resentful and that once his good opinion of someone is lost, it is lost forever. Elizabeth scolds Darcy for refusing\u0026nbsp;to change his opinion of others. At the end of the chapter, we get the\u0026nbsp;sense that Darcy is falling for Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-12\u0022 data-guid=\u00223245b027-c41e-46b9-92f8-7f837f875039\u0022\u003eChapter 12\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth sends her mother a letter to ask for a carriage to collect them from Netherfield Park, but Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet refuses because she secretly wants Jane to stay longer in Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley\u0027s company. However, the sisters borrow Bingley\u0026rsquo;s carriage. Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley is sad to see the girls go, but the others at Netherfield are relieved. Darcy is happy to no longer be tempted by Elizabeth, while Caroline is happy to see her competition leave.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-13\u0022 data-guid=\u002242bd0712-5670-4233-b763-ee7720c5bbb4\u0022\u003eChapter 13\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Longbourn, Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet tells his family that he has received a letter from his young cousin Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins who is coming\u0026nbsp;to see\u0026nbsp;them. Because\u0026nbsp;Mr\u0026nbsp;and Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet do\u0026nbsp;not have any sons, Collins will\u0026nbsp;inherit the estate when Mr\u0026nbsp;Bennet dies, even though he is only a distant relative. Although none of them has met him before, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet resents him instantly. His letter also states that he recently became a clergyman, and it is also full of excessive praise for Lady Catherine de Bourgh, his patroness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Collins arrives, he comes across as young, pompous, and formally mannered. He claims to understand\u0026nbsp;that him inheriting the estate must not be easy for the family and suggests that he could make amends by marrying one of the Bennet girls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-14\u0022 data-guid=\u0022543685b3-b138-405c-a9f8-d3d8cf0a2eb6\u0022\u003eChapter 14\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner, Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins starts talking about Lady Catherine de Bourgh, suggesting that he delights in flattering her and her daughter with carefully crafted compliments. Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins is invited to read aloud, and he chooses to read from a book of sermons, as he never reads novels. When Lydia gets bored and interrupts him,\u0026nbsp;Collins is offended. The rest of the family apologises, but Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins stops reading and the group switches to a game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-15\u0022 data-guid=\u002215997a5a-1235-4816-bcde-3a79677f99be\u0022\u003eChapter 15\u003ca name=\u0022_y0w7e88mo9tf\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe learn that Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins is not well-educated and that he feels lucky to have found a wealthy sponsor such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh. As a result, he is both humble and proud at the same time. As he came to visit the Bennets with an intention to marry, he first picks out\u0026nbsp;Jane. However, when he learns that Jane is likely to get engaged soon, he quickly\u0026nbsp;shifts his attention to Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCollins and the young Bennet women walk to Meryton. On the way, they meet a young\u0026nbsp;officer who knows Lydia and Kitty and who introduces them to a friend of his, Mr\u0026nbsp;Wickham. Bingley and Darcy also happen to pass the group. Elizabeth notices\u0026nbsp;that there is\u0026nbsp;tension between Darcy and Wickham.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr\u0026nbsp;Collins and the girls reach their aunt, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Philips, who invites them to dinner the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-16\u0022 data-guid=\u00224fb4f3f9-4ae0-439d-8c63-70a9a98eaea9\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_wybp0f3swwpi\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eChapter 16\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt dinner at Mrs\u0026nbsp;Philips\u0026rsquo;, the Bennet sisters meet Mr\u0026nbsp;Wickham again, and he and Elizabeth start chatting. When Elizabeth makes her disdain for Darcy known, Wickham also reveals his past connection with Darcy. He claims Darcy\u0026rsquo;s father was a good man who intended for Wickham to become a clergyman on one of the Darcy family\u0026rsquo;s estates and to receive a sum of money on his death. However, Wickham says\u0026nbsp;that when Darcy\u0026rsquo;s father died, Darcy refused to follow\u0026nbsp;his late father\u0026rsquo;s wishes. Wickham argues that Darcy was driven by jealousy because Darcy\u0026rsquo;s father liked Wickham more, despite the fact that Wickham was only the son of one of the late Darcy\u0027s employees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth is shocked and thinks Wickham should make the whole affair public. Wickham refuses, arguing he does not want to also dishonour the memory of Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy\u0026rsquo;s father. Wickham also talks about how protective Darcy is of his sister Georgiana, whom Wickham describes as\u0026nbsp;proud and disagreeable, and of\u0026nbsp;the fact that Darcy is supposed to marry Lady Catherine de Bourgh\u0026rsquo;s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-17\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d82bec57-8048-4fde-8bd9-f18d9eccb770\u0022\u003eChapter 17\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth tells Jane what she found out from Wickham, but Jane, characteristically, does not want to think badly of either Darcy or Wickham. She likes to think there has simply been a misunderstanding.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bingleys announce they will hold a ball at their estate, and they invite the Bennets. Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins wants to join the ball and asks Elizabeth to save some dances for him. Soon, she realises that Mr Collins probably wants to marry her and tries to put him off through her attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-18\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a30a9ae2-89b1-4fa1-b031-8b507bd6b486\u0022\u003eChapter 18\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night of the ball, Elizabeth is disappointed to find out that Wickham will not attend and suspects he wanted to avoid Mr\u0026nbsp;Darcy. She dances with Collins as promised\u0026nbsp;but is embarrassed by his poor dancing skills. When Darcy suddenly invites her to dance as well, Elizabeth is so surprised that she accepts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the dance, Elizabeth tries to provoke Darcy by talking about his character and making allusions to Wickham. While they are dancing, Sir William Lucas hints at the general expectation that Jane will marry Bingley. Afterwards, Darcy and Elizabeth part in silence, dissatisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCaroline Bingley warns Elizabeth not to trust Mr\u0026nbsp;Wickham, but she cannot give any details and comes off as snobbish, so Elizabeth angrily rejects her. She then discovers from Jane that Bingley - like Caroline - believes that Wickham is the one who is in the wrong, but Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;does not believe this either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJane spends most of the evening with Bingley, to Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s joy. However, Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;finds herself embarrassed by the other members of her family. When Collins discovers that Darcy is his patroness\u0026rsquo; nephew, he clumsily goes over to introduces himself, disregarding social etiquette. Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet talks loudly about the prospective engagement between Jane and Bingley, and Darcy overhears her. Mary plays the piano badly, her father intervenes indelicately, and Mr\u0026nbsp;Collins makes an embarrassing speech. At the end of the evening, Mrs\u0026nbsp;Bennet invites Mr\u0026nbsp;Bingley to dine at their household. He accepts\u0026nbsp;but says he first needs to go to London.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-19\u0022 data-guid=\u002258f2f129-d5f1-42a8-8a2e-8af2ba45d5ea\u0022\u003eChapter 19\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following day, Collins asks Elizabeth to marry him through a very long speech. When Elizabeth bluntly refuses him, he still refuses to believe her, saying that she must be playing hard to get. When she continues to refuse and he continues to insist, Elizabeth leaves the room.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Summary of Chapters 1-19 of Pride and Prejudice","MetaDescription":"In the Bennett family\u0027s household in the village of Longbourn, a heated discussion is taking place about the arrival of Mr Bingley, a wealthy bachelor who is renting the property at nearby Netherf (…)","IsPublished":true,"RedirectToLogin":false},"localizations":{"SearchContentPlaceholder":"Caută în Pride and Prejudice","PreviousPage":"Anterior","NextPage":"Următoarea","FavouriteDeselect":"Anulează preferința","FavouriteSelect":"Selectează ca favorit","FavouriteNotificationDeselect":"eBook-ul a fost eliminat din lista de preferate.","FavouriteNotificationSelect":"Ai marcat acest eBook ca favorit.
