As Mary pedantically remarks, &ldquo;human nature is particularly prone to&rdquo; pride (p. 13). We subsequently see that <strong>most characters in the novel struggle with this flaw</strong>, which often stops them from seeing situations and people objectively.</p><p>The consequences of pride are mostly explored through the main characters, <strong>Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy</strong>. Darcy&rsquo;s pride is initially a result of his belief in his superior social status. Seeing himself as important and sophisticated leads to Mr Darcy looking down on anyone whom he believes does not belong to his social circle. This is why he refuses to dance with Elizabeth at the first ball and even talks about her and other women in rather critical terms.</p><p>His pride is challenged by the fact that he begins to be attracted by Elizabeth&rsquo;s wit and physical appearance. While he still thinks he is superior, he falls in love with her and eventually decides to ask her to marry him. However, his proposal is still influenced by class pride &ndash; which makes him offend Elizabeth during his proposal, as he carefully outlines all the failings of her relatives.</p><p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s pride mainly derives from her belief in her intelligence and her ability to &lsquo;read people&rsquo;. Her pride is wounded when Darcy comments on her looks, saying she is only &lsquo;tolerable&rsquo;, as well as when he talks about her social inferiority as he proposes marriage. Nevertheless, <strong>Darcy and Elizabeth are the only characters in the novel who manage to overcome their pride</strong> and, as a result, they fall in love and marry.</p><p>At one point, <strong>Darcy and Elizabeth have a conversation about pride</strong> and whether it is a character failing or not, and Darcy, who believes pride may be a good thing, remarks that &ldquo;where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation&rdquo; (p. 40), which makes Elizabeth smile to herself. Ironically, Darcy does not have his pride &lsquo;under good regulation&rsquo; at this early stage in the novel. That only comes later, once he and Lizzy have learned from one another.</p><p>Unlike Lizzy and Darcy, <strong>all the other characters who are proud do not overcome this character flaw</strong>, possibly because they have no superiority of mind, as Darcy puts it, to see their own faults. Mrs Bennet takes pride in her daughters' beauty and in her position among her rural community. Lady Catherine is arrogant because of her aristocratic status and looks down on everyone, consequently refusing to accept any potential marriage between her nephew and Elizabeth. Mr Collins takes pride in being a clergyman but also in having Lady Catherine as a patron. None of these characters manage to change their proud nature. Mr Bennet, Caroline Bingley, Wickham, and Lydia all have moments of pride in the novel as well.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="caa7adef-f431-486d-a088-918338c23397">Prejudice</h2><p>Prejudice is the second key theme, as seen from the title of the novel. As in the case of pride, <strong>most characters develop prejudices </strong>against people and situations throughout Austen's&nbsp;novel.</p><p>The theme of prejudice is widely explored through<strong> Elizabeth and Darcy</strong>. Because Elizabeth thinks of herself as witty and intelligent, she falls into the trap of prejudice because she is too quick to form an opinion of others. Her prejudice against Darcy&rsquo;s belief in his superior social status and arrogance prevent her from seeing the good parts of his character, just as her prejudices make her believe Wickham&rsquo;s false stories about Darcy, without questioning them.</p><p>Darcy also develops prejudices against the Bennet family, as a result of his sense of superiority. Quickly judging them on appearances, he decides for himself that Jane does not love Bingley and that all the Bennets &ndash; except Elizabeth and Jane &ndash; lack propriety and good manners.</p><p>Austen explores the theme of prejudice in the novel by looking at <strong>appearance versus reality</strong>. In the novel we see that several characters are wrongfully judged based on the outer image they convey. Jane is judged by Darcy to be lacking affection for Bingley. Wickham is considered a victim of Darcy&rsquo;s evil deeds by Elizabeth and the Meryton community. Darcy is considered an arrogant person by Elizabeth, the Bennets, and others in the community. All these assumptions turn out to be false.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Elizabeth, it is important to notice that while Elizabeth manages to review her attitude and let go of her prejudices, this happens very slowly. She is often very stubborn in giving up or changing her opinions. This stubbornness is most visible when she reads Darcy&rsquo;s letter. Initially, she refuses to consider Darcy&rsquo;s points. It is only after re-reading and reflecting that she accepts the truth of his arguments.</p><p>Both Elizabeth and Darcy are able to be happy when they realise that prejudices create barriers against getting to know people. We see them <strong>both let go of their prejudices during Elizabeth&rsquo;s visit to Pemberley</strong>. There Darcy is willing to treat people of inferior social status like the Gardiners with more kindness and Elizabeth is more open to seeing other sides of Darcy.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="87c043b4-f367-4b6f-8cce-e59049797968">Love and&nbsp;marriage</h2><p>Another major theme in <em>Pride</em> <em>and</em> <em>Prejudice</em> is the view on marriage and the relationship between marriage and love. <strong>Linking this theme to the themes of prejudice and pride</strong>, the novel shows us how faulty impressions of others and yourself can stand in the way of a happy marriage.</p><p>For example, Darcy&rsquo;s pride and Elizabeth&rsquo;s prejudice initially prevent them from understanding each other and keep them apart. Only when Darcy and Elizabeth become willing to leave their pride and prejudice aside can they marry and find happiness together.</p><p><em>Pride and Prejudice </em>present us with various ideas of the perfect marriage, and individual characters represent different views.</p><h3>The marriage between Mr and Mrs Bennet</h3><p>We are told that &ldquo;the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand [Mr Bennet&rsquo;s] character&rdquo; (p. 3). Mr Bennet, in turn, frequently makes indirect fun of his wife and her limited intelligence. The two do not understand each other because <strong>their personalities are a bad match</strong>, for instance because Mr Bennet is more intelligent than his wife and more introverted. About halfway through the novel, we learn about the development of their relationship:</p><blockquote><p>Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. (pp. 164-165)</p></blockquote><p>It may have <strong>started out based on emotional or sexual attraction</strong> but has now turned to a rather unhappy union.</p><p>Their marriage is the example with which Elizabeth, Jane, and Lydia have grown up, and where the two elder sisters end up in happy marriages, Lydia is less fortunate. Elizabeth reflects on this when Lydia runs away with Wickham, realising particularly her father&rsquo;s failings:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father&rsquo;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain [&hellip;] that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.&rsquo;&nbsp;(p. 165)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Elizabeth (and her sisters) are now feeling the negative effects of their parents&rsquo; marriage</strong> &ndash; which is perhaps not so different from the experience of many modern-day daughters and sons. However, Elizabeth and Jane do manage to develop good values and principles, despite their parents&rsquo; behaviour. This is also possible because they have alternative role models, such as the Gardiners.&nbsp;</p><h3>The marriage between Lydia and Wickham</h3><p>In contrast to the Bennets, this marriage does seem to be a union of like minds, because the two share many character traits. However, since<strong> their relationship is mostly based on sexual attraction and money</strong>, it never becomes a happy one. The marriage only comes to be because Lydia decides to run away with Wickham, risking her reputation and breaking all social norms, which forces her relatives to bring about the marriage to cover up the scandal. Elizabeth, who is quite appalled at the thought of this union, discusses it with her father:</p><blockquote><p>&lsquo;And they <em>must</em> marry! Yet he is <em>such</em> a man!&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done.&rsquo;&nbsp;(p. 211)</p></blockquote><p>We get the impression that she is initially happy about the union, whereas Wickham must be persuaded by money to actually marry her. In any case, their relationship soon deteriorates: &ldquo;His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer&rdquo; (p. 272). This development mirrors that of the Bennets.</p><p>Importantly, Austen seems to argue that <strong>money is essential to happiness</strong> to some extent. Jane and Elizabeth both marry wealthy men and do not have financial worries, whereas the constant lack of money in Lydia and Wickham&rsquo;s marriage contributes to the deterioration of their relationship.</p><h3>The marriage between Charlotte Lucas and Mr Collins</h3><p>Their union is the classic example of a<strong> marriage of convenience</strong>. He is looking for a suitable wife for a clergyman, and she wants to avoid spinsterhood and becoming a burden to her family. Back then, women were not allowed to work to support themselves (unless they were working class women), so marriage was their only real chance of getting something resembling independence. By marrying, Collins and Charlotte both get what they want, although there are no feelings involved, at least not on Charlotte&rsquo;s behalf.</p><p>The fact that Austen does not even <em>show</em> us the proposal but merely lets the narrator briefly retell it underlines the business-like nature of it: &ldquo;In as short a time as Mr. Collins&rsquo;s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both&rdquo; (p. 87).</p><p><strong>Charlotte poses an interesting contrast to her friend Elizabeth </strong>when it comes to the view on love and marriage. She is aware that she is already 27 and not very pretty, and this is probably part of the reason why <strong>she is very practical and unromantic about marriage:</strong> &ldquo;Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.&rdquo; (p. 87). Charlotte is simply a woman who spots her chance and goes for it. Her general attitude to men and married happiness may be seen as cynical when she remarks: &ldquo;Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. [&hellip;] It is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life&rdquo;&nbsp;(p. 14). Elizabeth, being more of a romantic,&nbsp;does not agree.</p><p>We may view this type of marriage as sad, but Charlotte appears to be content. This leaves us with the feeling that although Austen would not choose such a union herself, she seems to understand why some people would. Thus, this marriage is portrayed with more understanding than that of the Bennets and Lydia and Wickham. Charlotte made her choice based on reason whereas the others let their desires lead them.</p><h3>The marriage between Jane and Bingley</h3><p>With this marriage, we are <strong>getting closer to the ideal marriage</strong> in every way. Unlike the unions outlined so far, this marriage is actually <strong>based on love</strong>. Jane and Bingley are compatible because <strong>they both have much of the same personality</strong>. As Mr Bennet teasingly puts it: &ldquo;Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on&rdquo; (p. 243). They are both very gentle people who prefer to be liked by everyone.</p><p>Although they fall in love in the beginning of the novel, they <strong>must overcome various misunderstandings and class difference</strong> before finally getting each other in the ending. This proves that they are both constant in their affection.</p><p>However, you may argue that their relationship lacks more friction &ndash; more difference in personality. In this respect, they pose a contrast to the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth who are two very different individuals. Bingley and Jane will undoubtedly get a happy and harmonious marriage, but it may be <strong>a marriage without much development of character</strong>.</p><p>Last but not least, this is a marriage where there will always be enough <strong>money </strong>since Bingley is quite wealthy. <strong><em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is <em>not</em> a story about sacrificing all for love</strong>. Neither Jane nor Lizzy need to do that because they do not break any social conventions by choosing the men they do. Lydia, on the other hand, does break social norms when she elopes with Wickham, but whether she does so out of true love is questionable.</p><h3>The marriage between Elizabeth and Darcy</h3><p>We get the feeling that <strong>this is the closest you get to a perfect marriage, according to Jane Austen</strong>. Partly because it is <strong>based on love</strong>, and partly because it is a match which will <strong>allow both parties to grow</strong>. Lastly, <strong>money</strong> is another advantage is this marriage; Elizabeth marries the wealthiest man in the novel.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth and Darcy have very different personalities</strong>, which is part of the reason why they do not like each other at first. Even more so than with Jane and Bingley, a series of misunderstandings and the issue of class difference almost prevents their marriage. It is an important point that they are unable to fall in love with each other <em>until</em> they have discovered their own faults (such as pride and prejudice) and developed into better people. On p. 259 in chapter 58, Darcy has a lengthy passage about how his personality and outlook on life has been transformed by his love for Elizabeth, which may be of interest to you if you want to explore this further.</p><p>Austen indicates that <strong>their development will continue in the future</strong>. At one point after the engagement to Darcy, Elizabeth is tempted to tease Darcy with something but checks herself: &ldquo;She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was too early to begin.&rdquo; (p. 261).</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="96d7786d-c9dd-4369-91b2-4842376562ec">Social class</h2><p>Aspects related to social class can be found throughout <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. Most characters are initially judged based on their social status. As these judgements rarely turn out to be true, we can say that the novel <strong>criticises the over-importance given to strict social hierarchies in Austen's society</strong>. In particular, the novel indicates that wealth does not automatically mean that a person has positive qualities or virtues.</p><p><strong>Austen's attitude towards the class system is highly complex - <em>and</em> is conservative at times</strong>. Just look at how the heroine makes sure to fall in love with a man who is both wealthy, a good person, and of good social status, which enables her to avoid breaking any social norms for love.&nbsp;</p><p>While Austen satirises characters like Lady Catherine for using social hierarchy for their own satisfaction and for failing to understand the realities of being poor, Austen also maintains the importance of the distinctions of &lsquo;good breeding&rsquo; and being &lsquo;gentlemanly&rsquo;. Because of the rising position of the upper middle classes during Jane Austen&rsquo;s era, <strong>there was a grey area around the middle levels of society and how they should act</strong>; Austen indicates that good behaviour, intelligence, and decorum can elevate some, like Elizabeth and Jane, to the sphere of the upper class.</p><p><strong>Darcy&rsquo;s initial class-consciousness</strong> makes him embody the title word of &lsquo;pride&rsquo; and look down on those of lower status. However, he comes to recognise and admire Elizabeth as a person. He also realises that upper-middle-class people such as the Gardiners can be as valuable &ndash; or more valuable &ndash; than upper-class people like the Bingley sisters and Lady Catherine, who are shown to have numerous flaws such as idleness, meanness and close-mindedness.&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of social class is also explored through <strong>reputation </strong>in the novel. The characters interact in a social setting in which your personal reputation matters greatly. Women in particular were expected to act in a certain manner that conformed to social conventions of proper female behaviour. For example, eloping with a man like Lydia does would mean the ruin of the whole family&rsquo;s reputation, as the woman would be considered a so-called <strong>fallen woman </strong>from then on. Luckily, Lydia&rsquo;s relatives secure her marriage to Wickham to patch up the scandal.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/interpretation" title="Interpretation of Pride and Prejudice" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Interpretation</span></a><a href="/pride-and-prejudice/interpretation/symbols" title="Symbols in Pride and Prejudice" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Symbols</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

As Mary pedantically remarks, \u0026ldquo;human nature is particularly prone to\u0026rdquo; pride (p. 13). We subsequently see that \u003cstrong\u003emost characters in the novel struggle with this flaw\u003c/strong\u003e, which often stops them from seeing situations and people objectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe consequences of pride are mostly explored through the main characters, \u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy\u003c/strong\u003e. Darcy\u0026rsquo;s pride is initially a result of his belief in his superior social status. Seeing himself as important and sophisticated leads to Mr Darcy looking down on anyone whom he believes does not belong to his social circle. This is why he refuses to dance with Elizabeth at the first ball and even talks about her and other women in rather critical terms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis pride is challenged by the fact that he begins to be attracted by Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s wit and physical appearance. While he still thinks he is superior, he falls in love with her and eventually decides to ask her to marry him. However, his proposal is still influenced by class pride \u0026ndash; which makes him offend Elizabeth during his proposal, as he carefully outlines all the failings of her relatives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElizabeth\u0026rsquo;s pride mainly derives from her belief in her intelligence and her ability to \u0026lsquo;read people\u0026rsquo;. Her pride is wounded when Darcy comments on her looks, saying she is only \u0026lsquo;tolerable\u0026rsquo;, as well as when he talks about her social inferiority as he proposes marriage. Nevertheless, \u003cstrong\u003eDarcy and Elizabeth are the only characters in the novel who manage to overcome their pride\u003c/strong\u003e and, as a result, they fall in love and marry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt one point, \u003cstrong\u003eDarcy and Elizabeth have a conversation about pride\u003c/strong\u003e and whether it is a character failing or not, and Darcy, who believes pride may be a good thing, remarks that \u0026ldquo;where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation\u0026rdquo; (p. 40), which makes Elizabeth smile to herself. Ironically, Darcy does not have his pride \u0026lsquo;under good regulation\u0026rsquo; at this early stage in the novel. That only comes later, once he and Lizzy have learned from one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike Lizzy and Darcy, \u003cstrong\u003eall the other characters who are proud do not overcome this character flaw\u003c/strong\u003e, possibly because they have no superiority of mind, as Darcy puts it, to see their own faults. Mrs Bennet takes pride in her daughters\u0027 beauty and in her position among her rural community. Lady Catherine is arrogant because of her aristocratic status and looks down on everyone, consequently refusing to accept any potential marriage between her nephew and Elizabeth. Mr Collins takes pride in being a clergyman but also in having Lady Catherine as a patron. None of these characters manage to change their proud nature. Mr Bennet, Caroline Bingley, Wickham, and Lydia all have moments of pride in the novel as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022caa7adef-f431-486d-a088-918338c23397\u0022\u003ePrejudice\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrejudice is the second key theme, as seen from the title of the novel. As in the case of pride, \u003cstrong\u003emost characters develop prejudices \u003c/strong\u003eagainst people and situations throughout Austen\u0027s\u0026nbsp;novel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe theme of prejudice is widely explored through\u003cstrong\u003e Elizabeth and Darcy\u003c/strong\u003e. Because Elizabeth thinks of herself as witty and intelligent, she falls into the trap of prejudice because she is too quick to form an opinion of others. Her prejudice against Darcy\u0026rsquo;s belief in his superior social status and arrogance prevent her from seeing the good parts of his character, just as her prejudices make her believe Wickham\u0026rsquo;s false stories about Darcy, without questioning them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDarcy also develops prejudices against the Bennet family, as a result of his sense of superiority. Quickly judging them on appearances, he decides for himself that Jane does not love Bingley and that all the Bennets \u0026ndash; except Elizabeth and Jane \u0026ndash; lack propriety and good manners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAusten explores the theme of prejudice in the novel by looking at \u003cstrong\u003eappearance versus reality\u003c/strong\u003e. In the novel we see that several characters are wrongfully judged based on the outer image they convey. Jane is judged by Darcy to be lacking affection for Bingley. Wickham is considered a victim of Darcy\u0026rsquo;s evil deeds by Elizabeth and the Meryton community. Darcy is considered an arrogant person by Elizabeth, the Bennets, and others in the community. All these assumptions turn out to be false.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the case of Elizabeth, it is important to notice that while Elizabeth manages to review her attitude and let go of her prejudices, this happens very slowly. She is often very stubborn in giving up or changing her opinions. This stubbornness is most visible when she reads Darcy\u0026rsquo;s letter. Initially, she refuses to consider Darcy\u0026rsquo;s points. It is only after re-reading and reflecting that she accepts the truth of his arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Elizabeth and Darcy are able to be happy when they realise that prejudices create barriers against getting to know people. We see them \u003cstrong\u003eboth let go of their prejudices during Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s visit to Pemberley\u003c/strong\u003e. There Darcy is willing to treat people of inferior social status like the Gardiners with more kindness and Elizabeth is more open to seeing other sides of Darcy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002287c043b4-f367-4b6f-8cce-e59049797968\u0022\u003eLove and\u0026nbsp;marriage\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother major theme in \u003cem\u003ePride\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ePrejudice\u003c/em\u003e is the view on marriage and the relationship between marriage and love. \u003cstrong\u003eLinking this theme to the themes of prejudice and pride\u003c/strong\u003e, the novel shows us how faulty impressions of others and yourself can stand in the way of a happy marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Darcy\u0026rsquo;s pride and Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s prejudice initially prevent them from understanding each other and keep them apart. Only when Darcy and Elizabeth become willing to leave their pride and prejudice aside can they marry and find happiness together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice \u003c/em\u003epresent us with various ideas of the perfect marriage, and individual characters represent different views.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe marriage between Mr and Mrs Bennet\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are told that \u0026ldquo;the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand [Mr Bennet\u0026rsquo;s] character\u0026rdquo; (p. 3). Mr Bennet, in turn, frequently makes indirect fun of his wife and her limited intelligence. The two do not understand each other because \u003cstrong\u003etheir personalities are a bad match\u003c/strong\u003e, for instance because Mr Bennet is more intelligent than his wife and more introverted. About halfway through the novel, we learn about the development of their relationship:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. (pp. 164-165)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may have \u003cstrong\u003estarted out based on emotional or sexual attraction\u003c/strong\u003e but has now turned to a rather unhappy union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir marriage is the example with which Elizabeth, Jane, and Lydia have grown up, and where the two elder sisters end up in happy marriages, Lydia is less fortunate. Elizabeth reflects on this when Lydia runs away with Wickham, realising particularly her father\u0026rsquo;s failings:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father\u0026rsquo;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain [\u0026hellip;] that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 165)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth (and her sisters) are now feeling the negative effects of their parents\u0026rsquo; marriage\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; which is perhaps not so different from the experience of many modern-day daughters and sons. However, Elizabeth and Jane do manage to develop good values and principles, despite their parents\u0026rsquo; behaviour. This is also possible because they have alternative role models, such as the Gardiners.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe marriage between Lydia and Wickham\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to the Bennets, this marriage does seem to be a union of like minds, because the two share many character traits. However, since\u003cstrong\u003e their relationship is mostly based on sexual attraction and money\u003c/strong\u003e, it never becomes a happy one. The marriage only comes to be because Lydia decides to run away with Wickham, risking her reputation and breaking all social norms, which forces her relatives to bring about the marriage to cover up the scandal. Elizabeth, who is quite appalled at the thought of this union, discusses it with her father:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;And they \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e marry! Yet he is \u003cem\u003esuch\u003c/em\u003e a man!\u0026rsquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026lsquo;Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done.\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 211)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe get the impression that she is initially happy about the union, whereas Wickham must be persuaded by money to actually marry her. In any case, their relationship soon deteriorates: \u0026ldquo;His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer\u0026rdquo; (p. 272). This development mirrors that of the Bennets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImportantly, Austen seems to argue that \u003cstrong\u003emoney is essential to happiness\u003c/strong\u003e to some extent. Jane and Elizabeth both marry wealthy men and do not have financial worries, whereas the constant lack of money in Lydia and Wickham\u0026rsquo;s marriage contributes to the deterioration of their relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe marriage between Charlotte Lucas and Mr Collins\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir union is the classic example of a\u003cstrong\u003e marriage of convenience\u003c/strong\u003e. He is looking for a suitable wife for a clergyman, and she wants to avoid spinsterhood and becoming a burden to her family. Back then, women were not allowed to work to support themselves (unless they were working class women), so marriage was their only real chance of getting something resembling independence. By marrying, Collins and Charlotte both get what they want, although there are no feelings involved, at least not on Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact that Austen does not even \u003cem\u003eshow\u003c/em\u003e us the proposal but merely lets the narrator briefly retell it underlines the business-like nature of it: \u0026ldquo;In as short a time as Mr. Collins\u0026rsquo;s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both\u0026rdquo; (p. 87).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharlotte poses an interesting contrast to her friend Elizabeth \u003c/strong\u003ewhen it comes to the view on love and marriage. She is aware that she is already 27 and not very pretty, and this is probably part of the reason why \u003cstrong\u003eshe is very practical and unromantic about marriage:\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ldquo;Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.\u0026rdquo; (p. 87). Charlotte is simply a woman who spots her chance and goes for it. Her general attitude to men and married happiness may be seen as cynical when she remarks: \u0026ldquo;Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. [\u0026hellip;] It is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;(p. 14). Elizabeth, being more of a romantic,\u0026nbsp;does not agree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may view this type of marriage as sad, but Charlotte appears to be content. This leaves us with the feeling that although Austen would not choose such a union herself, she seems to understand why some people would. Thus, this marriage is portrayed with more understanding than that of the Bennets and Lydia and Wickham. Charlotte made her choice based on reason whereas the others let their desires lead them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe marriage between Jane and Bingley\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this marriage, we are \u003cstrong\u003egetting closer to the ideal marriage\u003c/strong\u003e in every way. Unlike the unions outlined so far, this marriage is actually \u003cstrong\u003ebased on love\u003c/strong\u003e. Jane and Bingley are compatible because \u003cstrong\u003ethey both have much of the same personality\u003c/strong\u003e. As Mr Bennet teasingly puts it: \u0026ldquo;Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on\u0026rdquo; (p. 243). They are both very gentle people who prefer to be liked by everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough they fall in love in the beginning of the novel, they \u003cstrong\u003emust overcome various misunderstandings and class difference\u003c/strong\u003e before finally getting each other in the ending. This proves that they are both constant in their affection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, you may argue that their relationship lacks more friction \u0026ndash; more difference in personality. In this respect, they pose a contrast to the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth who are two very different individuals. Bingley and Jane will undoubtedly get a happy and harmonious marriage, but it may be \u003cstrong\u003ea marriage without much development of character\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, this is a marriage where there will always be enough \u003cstrong\u003emoney \u003c/strong\u003esince Bingley is quite wealthy. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a story about sacrificing all for love\u003c/strong\u003e. Neither Jane nor Lizzy need to do that because they do not break any social conventions by choosing the men they do. Lydia, on the other hand, does break social norms when she elopes with Wickham, but whether she does so out of true love is questionable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe marriage between Elizabeth and Darcy\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe get the feeling that \u003cstrong\u003ethis is the closest you get to a perfect marriage, according to Jane Austen\u003c/strong\u003e. Partly because it is \u003cstrong\u003ebased on love\u003c/strong\u003e, and partly because it is a match which will \u003cstrong\u003eallow both parties to grow\u003c/strong\u003e. Lastly, \u003cstrong\u003emoney\u003c/strong\u003e is another advantage is this marriage; Elizabeth marries the wealthiest man in the novel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eElizabeth and Darcy have very different personalities\u003c/strong\u003e, which is part of the reason why they do not like each other at first. Even more so than with Jane and Bingley, a series of misunderstandings and the issue of class difference almost prevents their marriage. It is an important point that they are unable to fall in love with each other \u003cem\u003euntil\u003c/em\u003e they have discovered their own faults (such as pride and prejudice) and developed into better people. On p. 259 in chapter 58, Darcy has a lengthy passage about how his personality and outlook on life has been transformed by his love for Elizabeth, which may be of interest to you if you want to explore this further.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAusten indicates that \u003cstrong\u003etheir development will continue in the future\u003c/strong\u003e. At one point after the engagement to Darcy, Elizabeth is tempted to tease Darcy with something but checks herself: \u0026ldquo;She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was too early to begin.\u0026rdquo; (p. 261).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u002296d7786d-c9dd-4369-91b2-4842376562ec\u0022\u003eSocial class\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAspects related to social class can be found throughout \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/em\u003e. Most characters are initially judged based on their social status. As these judgements rarely turn out to be true, we can say that the novel \u003cstrong\u003ecriticises the over-importance given to strict social hierarchies in Austen\u0027s society\u003c/strong\u003e. In particular, the novel indicates that wealth does not automatically mean that a person has positive qualities or virtues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAusten\u0027s attitude towards the class system is highly complex - \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e is conservative at times\u003c/strong\u003e. Just look at how the heroine makes sure to fall in love with a man who is both wealthy, a good person, and of good social status, which enables her to avoid breaking any social norms for love.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Austen satirises characters like Lady Catherine for using social hierarchy for their own satisfaction and for failing to understand the realities of being poor, Austen also maintains the importance of the distinctions of \u0026lsquo;good breeding\u0026rsquo; and being \u0026lsquo;gentlemanly\u0026rsquo;. Because of the rising position of the upper middle classes during Jane Austen\u0026rsquo;s era, \u003cstrong\u003ethere was a grey area around the middle levels of society and how they should act\u003c/strong\u003e; Austen indicates that good behaviour, intelligence, and decorum can elevate some, like Elizabeth and Jane, to the sphere of the upper class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDarcy\u0026rsquo;s initial class-consciousness\u003c/strong\u003e makes him embody the title word of \u0026lsquo;pride\u0026rsquo; and look down on those of lower status. However, he comes to recognise and admire Elizabeth as a person. He also realises that upper-middle-class people such as the Gardiners can be as valuable \u0026ndash; or more valuable \u0026ndash; than upper-class people like the Bingley sisters and Lady Catherine, who are shown to have numerous flaws such as idleness, meanness and close-mindedness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe theme of social class is also explored through \u003cstrong\u003ereputation \u003c/strong\u003ein the novel. The characters interact in a social setting in which your personal reputation matters greatly. Women in particular were expected to act in a certain manner that conformed to social conventions of proper female behaviour. For example, eloping with a man like Lydia does would mean the ruin of the whole family\u0026rsquo;s reputation, as the woman would be considered a so-called \u003cstrong\u003efallen woman \u003c/strong\u003efrom then on. Luckily, Lydia\u0026rsquo;s relatives secure her marriage to Wickham to patch up the scandal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Themes in Pride and Prejudice","MetaDescription":"As the title of Austen\u0027s Pride and Prejudice announces, pride is an important theme in the story.
