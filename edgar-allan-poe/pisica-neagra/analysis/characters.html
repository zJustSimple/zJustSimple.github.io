He is a developing character because his way of acting and thinking change throughout the story.</p><h2 data-guid="975fb605-3e0f-4826-979f-c65c4d2b04a9">Outer characterisation</h2><p>The narrator does not offer any details about his age, occupation, or outer appearance. However, it can be assumed that he is most likely in his early 30s because he had married young (l. 22) and the main events happen several years later (l. 34).&nbsp;He is probably middle-class or has a higher social standing, as he can afford to keep many pets, including exotic ones (l. 24), and employ servants (l. 80). He has enough means to get by even after he loses his house in a fire (ll. 174-175). He also appears to have received a good education, as he is knowledgeable about the way monks tortured people in the Middle Ages (l. 190).</p><p>The narrator states that he writes from a felon&rsquo;s cell, therefore implying that he was arrested (l. 149).</p><h2 data-guid="906e4617-df69-456f-8853-63854aa52a1a">Inner characterisation</h2><p>A great part of the narrator&rsquo;s inner characterisation comes from his <strong>self-reflection</strong>. The narrator reflects on the person he used to be and the person he has turned into, giving details and explanations about the evolution of his character from &ldquo;docility and humanity&rdquo; (l. 12) to irrevocable &ldquo;Perverseness&rdquo; (l. 62). He describes his change as follows:</p><blockquote><p>I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them (ll. 36-39).</p></blockquote><p>He is also reflecting on his own actions, as he is aware that his cruelty leads him to commit immoral acts: &ldquo;I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin &ndash; a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul&rdquo; (ll. 75-76).</p><p>The narrator seems to <strong>lose more of his humanity</strong> as the story progresses. At first, he retains a part of his old heart (l. 60), but by the end of the story, he states that &ldquo;the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole intimates&rdquo; (ll. 168-169). He attributes this change to <strong>alcoholism</strong>, because his drinking habit turns him into an irritable person who has no regard for other people&rsquo;s feelings (l. 37). However, the narrator does not seem to fully know the motivation behind his actions (l. 128). He also implies that he has been overcome by the &ldquo;spirit of PERVERSNESS&rdquo; (l. 62), which he describes as a&nbsp;primitive impulse of human nature that drives people to break the laws simply because it is within their power to do so.</p><p>The narrator also forms an unusually close attachment to his pets, even during his childhood preferring their company to that of other people (ll. 15-21). This suggests the narrator&rsquo;s <strong>social alienation</strong>. As an adult, he does not seem to have a close connection with any other person than his wife.</p><p>He also suffers <strong>inner turmoil,</strong> represented by his conflicting attitude towards the cats. Although he knows that there is no serious reason to hurt Pluto, he still does it (ll. 74-75). Then, after he kills the cat, he wants to replace it, as if a similar cat would erase his cruelty. However, soon after he gets a new cat, he starts resenting this one as well. This reaction is triggered by his sense of guilt and his rejection of it.</p><p>The narrator is <strong>emotionally unstable</strong>. He has difficulties controlling his anger, is violent, and develops sadistic&nbsp;tendencies: &ldquo;The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer&rdquo; (ll. 47-48); &ldquo;into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain&rdquo; (ll. 179-180). He beats his pets and his wife (ll. 38-39), cuts out Pluto&rsquo;s eye and hangs the cat in cold blood, before killing his wife when she tries to stop him from killing the other cat. Moreover, the narrator is highly suspicious as he becomes aggressive when he thinks Pluto is avoiding him: &ldquo;at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation&rdquo; (ll. 60-61).</p><p>Moreover, he is <strong>arrogant</strong>. He seems to think little of other people, as he refers to them as &ldquo;mere Men&rdquo; (l. 31) and does not seek out their friendship. When tormented by the second cat&rsquo;s presence, the narrator seems to be indignant about the sway the cat has on him, talking about himself as being a superior being and seemingly taking pride in the fact that he has killed Pluto: &ldquo;And a brute beast&ndash;whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed&ndash;a brute beast to work out for me&ndash;for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God&ndash;so much of insufferable wo!&rdquo; (ll. 161-163). Ultimately, his arrogance is his downfall, as he accidentally exposes his crime due to his bravado. By getting over-confident in the meticulous way he hid his wife&rsquo;s body, the narrator taps the wall and triggers the cat&rsquo;s cry: &ldquo; &lsquo;(&hellip;) these walls are solidly put together;&rsquo; and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom. (ll. 235-237).</p><p>The narrator seems to <strong>lose his ability to feel remorse</strong>. After he injures Pluto, the narrator experiences &ldquo;a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse&rdquo; (l. 54), as well as after he kills the cat (l. 73). However, as time passes, he becomes more insensitive to these feelings: &ldquo;For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse&rdquo; (ll. 106-107).</p><p>Furthermore, after he kills his wife, he immediately tries to devise a plan to hide her body. He even seems to feel joy after he hides the body, being pleased by his work: &ldquo;I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself &ndash; &lsquo;Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain&rsquo; (ll. 205-206). In the absence of the cat and the wife, the narrator feels at peace instead of regretting his deed: &ldquo;I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!&rdquo; (l. 214); &ldquo;My happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little&rdquo; (l. 217).</p><p>However, as he awaits his death, the narrator <strong>seems to regain part of his conscience and humanity</strong>. He wishes to unburden his soul (l. 4) and seems to be very ashamed of his actions: &ldquo;these events have terrified -- have tortured -- have destroyed me&rdquo; (l. 6); &ldquo;I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity&rdquo; (ll. 51-52). He tells the story without expecting or soliciting people to believe him (ll. 1-2), however, he claims that he is not mad (l. 3). He seems to hope that others will see his story with a clearer mind than his and perhaps find a logical explanation for his actions:</p><blockquote><p>Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place -- some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects. (ll. 8-11)</p></blockquote><p>The narrator is <strong>a developing character</strong> because he drastically changes the way he thinks and behaves. The narrator goes from one extreme to another; from truly loving animals to torturing and killing them.&nbsp;Although he shows no remorse when committing the crime, at the moment of narration the narrator seems to realise the gravity of his actions and tries to make sense of the events.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="structure.html" title="Structure of The Black Cat" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Structure</span></a><a href="setting.html" title="Setting of The Black Cat" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Setting</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

He is a developing character because his way of acting and thinking change throughout the story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022975fb605-3e0f-4826-979f-c65c4d2b04a9\u0022\u003eOuter characterisation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator does not offer any details about his age, occupation, or outer appearance. However, it can be assumed that he is most likely in his early 30s because he had married young (l. 22) and the main events happen several years later (l. 34).\u0026nbsp;He is probably middle-class or has a higher social standing, as he can afford to keep many pets, including exotic ones (l. 24), and employ servants (l. 80). He has enough means to get by even after he loses his house in a fire (ll. 174-175). He also appears to have received a good education, as he is knowledgeable about the way monks tortured people in the Middle Ages (l. 190).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator states that he writes from a felon\u0026rsquo;s cell, therefore implying that he was arrested (l. 149).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022906e4617-df69-456f-8853-63854aa52a1a\u0022\u003eInner characterisation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA great part of the narrator\u0026rsquo;s inner characterisation comes from his \u003cstrong\u003eself-reflection\u003c/strong\u003e. The narrator reflects on the person he used to be and the person he has turned into, giving details and explanations about the evolution of his character from \u0026ldquo;docility and humanity\u0026rdquo; (l. 12) to irrevocable \u0026ldquo;Perverseness\u0026rdquo; (l. 62). He describes his change as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them (ll. 36-39).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe is also reflecting on his own actions, as he is aware that his cruelty leads him to commit immoral acts: \u0026ldquo;I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin \u0026ndash; a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul\u0026rdquo; (ll. 75-76).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator seems to \u003cstrong\u003elose more of his humanity\u003c/strong\u003e as the story progresses. At first, he retains a part of his old heart (l. 60), but by the end of the story, he states that \u0026ldquo;the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole intimates\u0026rdquo; (ll. 168-169). He attributes this change to \u003cstrong\u003ealcoholism\u003c/strong\u003e, because his drinking habit turns him into an irritable person who has no regard for other people\u0026rsquo;s feelings (l. 37). However, the narrator does not seem to fully know the motivation behind his actions (l. 128). He also implies that he has been overcome by the \u0026ldquo;spirit of PERVERSNESS\u0026rdquo; (l. 62), which he describes as a\u0026nbsp;primitive impulse of human nature that drives people to break the laws simply because it is within their power to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator also forms an unusually close attachment to his pets, even during his childhood preferring their company to that of other people (ll. 15-21). This suggests the narrator\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003esocial alienation\u003c/strong\u003e. As an adult, he does not seem to have a close connection with any other person than his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also suffers \u003cstrong\u003einner turmoil,\u003c/strong\u003e represented by his conflicting attitude towards the cats. Although he knows that there is no serious reason to hurt Pluto, he still does it (ll. 74-75). Then, after he kills the cat, he wants to replace it, as if a similar cat would erase his cruelty. However, soon after he gets a new cat, he starts resenting this one as well. This reaction is triggered by his sense of guilt and his rejection of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator is \u003cstrong\u003eemotionally unstable\u003c/strong\u003e. He has difficulties controlling his anger, is violent, and develops sadistic\u0026nbsp;tendencies: \u0026ldquo;The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer\u0026rdquo; (ll. 47-48); \u0026ldquo;into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain\u0026rdquo; (ll. 179-180). He beats his pets and his wife (ll. 38-39), cuts out Pluto\u0026rsquo;s eye and hangs the cat in cold blood, before killing his wife when she tries to stop him from killing the other cat. Moreover, the narrator is highly suspicious as he becomes aggressive when he thinks Pluto is avoiding him: \u0026ldquo;at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation\u0026rdquo; (ll. 60-61).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, he is \u003cstrong\u003earrogant\u003c/strong\u003e. He seems to think little of other people, as he refers to them as \u0026ldquo;mere Men\u0026rdquo; (l. 31) and does not seek out their friendship. When tormented by the second cat\u0026rsquo;s presence, the narrator seems to be indignant about the sway the cat has on him, talking about himself as being a superior being and seemingly taking pride in the fact that he has killed Pluto: \u0026ldquo;And a brute beast\u0026ndash;whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed\u0026ndash;a brute beast to work out for me\u0026ndash;for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God\u0026ndash;so much of insufferable wo!\u0026rdquo; (ll. 161-163). Ultimately, his arrogance is his downfall, as he accidentally exposes his crime due to his bravado. By getting over-confident in the meticulous way he hid his wife\u0026rsquo;s body, the narrator taps the wall and triggers the cat\u0026rsquo;s cry: \u0026ldquo; \u0026lsquo;(\u0026hellip;) these walls are solidly put together;\u0026rsquo; and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom. (ll. 235-237).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator seems to \u003cstrong\u003elose his ability to feel remorse\u003c/strong\u003e. After he injures Pluto, the narrator experiences \u0026ldquo;a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse\u0026rdquo; (l. 54), as well as after he kills the cat (l. 73). However, as time passes, he becomes more insensitive to these feelings: \u0026ldquo;For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse\u0026rdquo; (ll. 106-107).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, after he kills his wife, he immediately tries to devise a plan to hide her body. He even seems to feel joy after he hides the body, being pleased by his work: \u0026ldquo;I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself \u0026ndash; \u0026lsquo;Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain\u0026rsquo; (ll. 205-206). In the absence of the cat and the wife, the narrator feels at peace instead of regretting his deed: \u0026ldquo;I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!\u0026rdquo; (l. 214); \u0026ldquo;My happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little\u0026rdquo; (l. 217).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, as he awaits his death, the narrator \u003cstrong\u003eseems to regain part of his conscience and humanity\u003c/strong\u003e. He wishes to unburden his soul (l. 4) and seems to be very ashamed of his actions: \u0026ldquo;these events have terrified -- have tortured -- have destroyed me\u0026rdquo; (l. 6); \u0026ldquo;I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity\u0026rdquo; (ll. 51-52). He tells the story without expecting or soliciting people to believe him (ll. 1-2), however, he claims that he is not mad (l. 3).
