In its most basic understanding, the American Dream refers to the ideal context of the government protecting each individual&rsquo;s opportunity to pursue their dreams and achieve success through hard work and regardless of their social background.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The oldest document which inspired the American Dream was&nbsp;<strong>the Declaration of Independence</strong>&nbsp;from 1776, which guarantees people&rsquo;s right to life, freedom, and the pursuit of a good life :</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Founding Fathers of the United States expressed an idea which was revolutionary at that time: people&rsquo;s desire to pursue happiness was a human right. This created a society which was very appealing for those aspiring to a better life. To the writers of the Declaration, the American Dream could only be achieved if it was not blocked by&nbsp;&ldquo;taxation without representation&rdquo;</span>, which is what the British rule did in the colonies.</p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Note that the original US Constitution&nbsp;only claimed these rights for&nbsp;white, male property-owners. However, in time - and thanks to activism and civil rights movements - laws were added to extend these rights to African Americans, women, and other minorities.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="632c1058-26d7-4f52-9a72-cc9123acad66"><span style="color:#1a242e;">America as a melting pot</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The idea of the American Dream also developed with&nbsp;<strong>migration from Europe</strong>&nbsp;to America during the industrial revolution. Those who traveled to the US were looking for work opportunities and a better life than the one they had in their home countries where things tended to be more conservative and less egalitarian. America turned into a land of opportunities where religion and socio-economic background were no longer challenges in achieving prosperity, provided you worked hard.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The great migration from Europe to the US is considered to have started around the 1820s. By the end of the 19</span><sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">th</span></sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;century, people from other parts of the world also started moving to the US. However, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act prevented all foreign-born Chinese immigrants from becoming American citizens, making the Chinese the biggest group excluded from &lsquo;the American Dream&rsquo; at the time.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The French-American writer J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur coined the theory of&nbsp;<strong>the melting pot</strong>, according to which the cultural, racial, and religious mixture in the US would eventually create one all-encompassing American society.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The US government also started promoting itself as a place of liberty and prosperity in the early 19</span><sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">th</span></sup><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;century, encouraging more people to come to the US. In America, it was possible to become a so-called&nbsp;<strong>self-made man</strong>, meaning that here&nbsp;you could move up in the world&nbsp;through your own hard work and dedication. Your religious, social, or ethnic background did not matter. At least in theory.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="093cb98b-b4aa-434d-bf9e-acd4a3bbd5f7"><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Gold Rush</span></h2><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The discovery of gold in California in 1848</span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">&nbsp;further encouraged migration to California -&nbsp;both from other parts of the US and from outside the US. The news of gold attracted about 300,000 people to the region and quickly turned California into a new US state. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there were no laws regarding property rights in the area, so whoever made claims could have the land.&nbsp;California became internationally known as the &lsquo;golden state&rsquo; and attracted generations of immigrants.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The discovery of gold did not make all those who mined for it rich, except for&nbsp;a small minority. Nevertheless, gold made the US seem all the more attractive to people as a land of opportunity and freedom, especially at the Frontier.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The California gold rush is the last and the most well-known one, but prior to it, there were also gold rushes in Carolina (1799-1835) and Georgia (1829-1838). All these gold rushes had negative effects on&nbsp;<strong>the Native Americans</strong>, whose populations were attacked and driven away from their lands.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="3fd219ef-43ca-48bf-8f4b-db980c485193"><span style="color:#1a242e;">The American Civil War</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After the gold rushes, the American Civil War (1861-1865) showed that there were&nbsp;<strong>two different views on the American Dream</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Northern states believed in achieving the American Dream by ending slavery, through a federal government and&nbsp;industrial development. Southern states wanted a confederation and supported the slavery system, suggesting they only believed in the American Dream for white people.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After the Northern states won the war and abolished slavery, their more inclusive&nbsp;version of the American Dream became more popular, though the former slaves&nbsp;were still heavily restricted from pursuing the Dream in practice for decades to come, thanks to a number of discriminatory laws and widespread racism.</span></p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="204b3b1e-89f8-4d81-8fe9-b6b3a6316ad2"><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">The Great D</span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">epression and the aftermath of WWII</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">By the early 20th century, the American Dream became almost synonymous with upward social mobility, a so-called&nbsp;<strong>rags-to-riches</strong>&nbsp;dream.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, following World War I, the American Dream became more about the desire to own material things rather than creating a better life. You might say that it slowly went from being an idealistic dream to a materialistic one. This change was depicted in detail by F. Scott Fitzgerald in his famous novel<em>&nbsp;The Great Gatsby</em>.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Some consider that the greed-fueled American Dream is what led to&nbsp;<strong>the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression</strong>. The Depression made countless self-made millionaires lose their fortunes&nbsp;but also drove middle-class and&nbsp;working-class people to poverty, forcing some of them&nbsp;to beg and live on the streets. At this point, there were few who still believed in the American Dream.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">To keep the American Dream going, President Franklin D. Roosevelt launched a series of social programs to help the poor. However, it was not until&nbsp;<strong>the end of World War II</strong>&nbsp;that Americans felt like they were living the American Dream of prosperity once again.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Thanks to an economy pushed by huge military spending, the United States emerged from the war as the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world. Factories were opened to meet the needs of the growing population, wages increased, and many workers were now able to enter the middle class. It was at this point that the belief that life would get better and better, provided you work&nbsp;hard enough, gained solid roots among Americans.</span></p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="bdd24137-75e6-406c-b488-8e88f1ceaeac"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Questioning the Dream</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The belief in the American Dream&nbsp;was challenged once again when&nbsp;<strong>Baby Boomers</strong>&nbsp;(children born after WWII) grew up and started questioning their parents&rsquo; version of the dream. At the same time, African Americans were organizing&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color:#0075e3;"><a href="../the-civil-rights-movement.html"><span style="color:#0075e3;">the Civil Right Movement</span></a></span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">, showing that up to that point, they had been denied the same rights and opportunities that white Americans took for granted.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In the 1970s, the US economy experienced a&nbsp;<strong>recession</strong>&nbsp;with high inflation.&nbsp;By the end of the decade, many Americans worried they would not be able to pay their mortgages. Furthermore, racial tensions were still strong and society was divided by&nbsp;<strong>the Vietnam War</strong>. Some people believed it was America&rsquo;s duty to fight the war. But as the war prolonged, more people started to be against young American soldiers dying for a cause that seemed increasingly meaningless.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Trust in the American Dream was restored during&nbsp;<strong>President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s administration</strong>, partially because Reagan&rsquo;s own example embodied the American Dream (he rose to fame from poverty). Reagan introduced tax cuts to encourage economic growth. The economy apparently recovered. However,&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#0075e3;"><a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/american-dream4.htm"><span style="color:#0075e3;">this positive impact was not felt by everyone</span></a></span><span style="color:#1a242e;">. On the contrary, &ldquo;between 1979 and 2005, the income of the bottom 99 percent of US&nbsp;households grew 21 percent after taxes, a rate of less than one percent a year, not enough to keep up with inflation&rdquo;. At the same time, the income of the&nbsp;richest one percent of Americans grew by 225 percent.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Furthermore, in 2007-2008, the financial crisis started with the collapse of the&nbsp;financial investment company Goldman&nbsp;Sachs. These led to a global recession, affecting many Americans who lost their homes.&nbsp;<strong>The 2008 economic crisis</strong>&nbsp;was often compared to the Great Depression which also led to people losing jobs and homes. The crisis further affected Americans&rsquo; faith in the American Dream.</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#0075e3;"><a title="The Civil Rights Movement" href="../the-civil-rights-movement.html"><span style="color:#0075e3;">The Civil Rights Movement</span></a></span></strong></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In our focused guide to the civil rights movement, you can read about this mass protest movement aimed at obtaining legal and civil rights for African Americans in much more detail.
