The opposition became stronger once Americans learned about brutal killings committed by American soldiers, such as the Mai Lai massacre of March 1968.</p><p>Richard Nixon became President in 1969 and supported the retreat of US troops from Vietnam by giving financial aid to the South Vietnamese Army, instead. In 1969, a series of demonstrations were held across the US, calling for an end to the Vietnam War. However, the US troops still got involved in conflicts, attacking Cambodia (1970) and Laos (1971) in their pursuit of the Viet Cong.</p><p>A cease-fire agreement was reached in January 1973, and by March, the last American troops returned from South Vietnam. Two years later, the war ended when Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, was taken over by the communists from the North.</p><p>In general, the Vietnam War is seen as a failure for the US&nbsp;because it did not prevent communists from taking over Vietnam.&nbsp;The US had gotten involved in the war expecting a quick victory. However, losing the war exposed the faults in the US&rsquo;s approach to communist containment, which relied heavily on a competition with the Soviet Union over who had the most influence in other countries. After the Vietnam War, the US began to transform its policy of containment, focusing more on developing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="f39f85b7-d537-42be-8f11-9471b918f2ec">D&eacute;tente</h2><p>Part of the Cold War era also saw <strong>a period of eased tension between the US and the Soviet Union</strong>. This period, known as <em>d&eacute;tente</em>, lasted from the late 1960s until the late 1970s.</p><p><em>D&eacute;tente </em>followed after the tensions between the two superpowers culminated with <a target="" href="early-years.html">the Cuban Missile Crisis</a>. Having reached the closest point to actual nuclear war during the crisis, both the US and the Soviet Union seemed motivated to avoid a nuclear event. As a result,<strong> some of the world&rsquo;s first arms-control pacts were developed</strong>, including the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963 which prohibited detonations of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in space (though tests underground were still allowed).</p><p>Arms control discussions were resumed again in the late 1960s&nbsp;because both superpowers faced economic difficulties brought on by their competition in the arms race, as well as the use of their resources in military research and operations. The US was also motivated to improve its relationship with the Soviets after the costly war in Vietnam&nbsp;and sought to avoid future conflicts.</p><p>The discussion led to other pacts, like <strong>the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty</strong> in 1968, in which several nations pledged to limit the spread of nuclear technology.</p><p><strong>The Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty</strong>, which limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles each side could own, was also signed in 1972. In 1975, <strong>the Helsinki Final Act</strong> was signed by 35 nations, addressing a range of issues related to the Cold War, such as the promotion of human rights, the establishment of military borders, and the creation of opportunities for cultural exchange and&nbsp;trade.</p><p>The Cuban Missile Crisis also led to <strong>the &ldquo;red telephone&rdquo;</strong> being installed &ndash; a direct telephone line between the Kremlin&nbsp;and the White House. The red telephone allowed the superpowers&rsquo; leaders to reduce the risk of catastrophic misunderstandings by providing a direct and efficient communication line.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="9a0ca77e-b2be-4ff1-9226-223bca21f19f">Re-escalation of conflict and the Soviet-Afghan War</h2><p>In the late 1970s, progress on arms control stalled and the competition between the US and the Soviet Union was renewed. <em>D&eacute;tente </em>ended with the <strong>Soviet Union invading Afghanistan</strong> in 1979. Ronald Reagan, an anti-<em>d&eacute;tente </em>candidate, was then elected in 1980 as President of the United States.</p><p><strong>Ronald Reagan renewed the anti-Soviet stance of the US</strong> by funding older nuclear programs and increasing the production of nuclear missiles. This led to a complete stall of arms control talks, which would not be resumed until 1987&nbsp;when the Washington Treaty &ndash; the first out of three treaties which limited nuclear power &ndash; was signed.</p><p>At the beginning of 1979, <strong>the Soviet Union began to provide military aid to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA)</strong>, a communist government which took over the country with support from the Soviets. The DRA was engaged in a conflict against rebel mujaheddin groups that opposed modernization and land reforms in the country&nbsp;and perceived communism as a threat to their Muslim faith.</p><p>At the end of 1979, the Soviet Union decided to invade Afghanistan, fearing that the new DRA leader, Hafizullah Amin, was having discussions with the US. The invasion led to the US boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.</p><p><strong>US President Jimmy Carter</strong>, intent on overthrowing the communist regime and preventing the spread of its ideology,<b> supported the mujaheddin&nbsp;with money and weapons</b>. Between 1980 and 1981, the mujaheddin became stronger with support from the US, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Moreover, they began to organize and coordinate better, delivering more effective attacks against the Soviet troops and the DRA.</p><p>In 1985, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&rsquo;s efforts to end the war by bringing more troops resulted in numerous casualties on both sides. In 1986, the mujaheddin became a stronger force, as they were able to shoot down Soviet helicopters using weapons provided by the US.</p><p>The war continued with little progress for the Soviets. This damaged their reputation as the strongest army in the world. In 1988, <strong>Gorbachev signed a peace treaty</strong> and started to retreat the Soviet troops from Afghanistan.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="5d7f0317-a830-4af0-a786-bafb7b3aeb50">Gorbachev&rsquo;s reforms and their consequences</h2><p>In 1985, <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong> was appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party. As the country had stalled both economically and politically, Gorbachev launched two important reform policies: perestroika and glasnost.</p><p>The goal of <strong>perestroika </strong>was to restructure the political and economic system that had begun to fall apart under the Communist Party.</p><p>Economically, perestroika sought to create a semi-free market system by allowing people to part-own businesses and ending the price controls kept in place for the last seven decades by the communist regime. However, this led to social discontent as the new economy did not provide immediate results; moreover, the slow change caused a shortage of food, strikes, and civil unrest.</p><p>Politically, perestroika meant that the people could challenge elections. Moreover, in later years, other political organizations besides the Communist Party could be formed once Gorbachev opened up the political system.</p><p>The Soviet leader&rsquo;s policy of openness and transparency &ndash; <strong>glasnost</strong> &ndash; sought to provide more freedoms and rights to the Soviet people through a range of political and social reforms. Freedom of expression was encouraged, but this also led to the formerly state-controlled media exposing the difficult living conditions in the Soviet Union&nbsp;and the corruption and crimes of the government. This type of news caused disillusionment with the communist ideology&nbsp;and the rise of social protests.</p><p>Gorbachev also tried to curb the country&rsquo;s economic and political decline by reducing military costs and improving international relations. He&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;signed treaties which&nbsp;promised to destroy Soviet missiles in Europe&nbsp;and limit their production. Moreover, he withdrew Soviet support from several satellite countries.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="early-years.html" title="Early years (~1947-1962) of the Cold War" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Early years (~1947-1962)</span></a><a href="../the-end.html" title="The end of the Cold War" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The end of the Cold War</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The opposition became stronger once Americans learned about brutal killings committed by American soldiers, such as the Mai Lai massacre of March 1968.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRichard Nixon became President in 1969 and supported the retreat of US troops from Vietnam by giving financial aid to the South Vietnamese Army, instead. In 1969, a series of demonstrations were held across the US, calling for an end to the Vietnam War. However, the US troops still got involved in conflicts, attacking Cambodia (1970) and Laos (1971) in their pursuit of the Viet Cong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA cease-fire agreement was reached in January 1973, and by March, the last American troops returned from South Vietnam. Two years later, the war ended when Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, was taken over by the communists from the North.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, the Vietnam War is seen as a failure for the US\u0026nbsp;because it did not prevent communists from taking over Vietnam.\u0026nbsp;The US had gotten involved in the war expecting a quick victory. However, losing the war exposed the faults in the US\u0026rsquo;s approach to communist containment, which relied heavily on a competition with the Soviet Union over who had the most influence in other countries. After the Vietnam War, the US began to transform its policy of containment, focusing more on developing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022f39f85b7-d537-42be-8f11-9471b918f2ec\u0022\u003eD\u0026eacute;tente\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of the Cold War era also saw \u003cstrong\u003ea period of eased tension between the US and the Soviet Union\u003c/strong\u003e. This period, known as \u003cem\u003ed\u0026eacute;tente\u003c/em\u003e, lasted from the late 1960s until the late 1970s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eD\u0026eacute;tente \u003c/em\u003efollowed after the tensions between the two superpowers culminated with \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/the-cold-war/conflict-itself/early-years#heading-7\u0022\u003ethe Cuban Missile Crisis\u003c/a\u003e. Having reached the closest point to actual nuclear war during the crisis, both the US and the Soviet Union seemed motivated to avoid a nuclear event. As a result,\u003cstrong\u003e some of the world\u0026rsquo;s first arms-control pacts were developed\u003c/strong\u003e, including the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963 which prohibited detonations of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in space (though tests underground were still allowed).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArms control discussions were resumed again in the late 1960s\u0026nbsp;because both superpowers faced economic difficulties brought on by their competition in the arms race, as well as the use of their resources in military research and operations. The US was also motivated to improve its relationship with the Soviets after the costly war in Vietnam\u0026nbsp;and sought to avoid future conflicts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe discussion led to other pacts, like \u003cstrong\u003ethe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty\u003c/strong\u003e in 1968, in which several nations pledged to limit the spread of nuclear technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty\u003c/strong\u003e, which limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles each side could own, was also signed in 1972. In 1975, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Helsinki Final Act\u003c/strong\u003e was signed by 35 nations, addressing a range of issues related to the Cold War, such as the promotion of human rights, the establishment of military borders, and the creation of opportunities for cultural exchange and\u0026nbsp;trade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Cuban Missile Crisis also led to \u003cstrong\u003ethe \u0026ldquo;red telephone\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e being installed \u0026ndash; a direct telephone line between the Kremlin\u0026nbsp;and the White House.

This led to a complete stall of arms control talks, which would not be resumed until 1987\u0026nbsp;when the Washington Treaty \u0026ndash; the first out of three treaties which limited nuclear power \u0026ndash; was signed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 1979, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Soviet Union began to provide military aid to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA)\u003c/strong\u003e, a communist government which took over the country with support from the Soviets. The DRA was engaged in a conflict against rebel mujaheddin groups that opposed modernization and land reforms in the country\u0026nbsp;and perceived communism as a threat to their Muslim faith.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of 1979, the Soviet Union decided to invade Afghanistan, fearing that the new DRA leader, Hafizullah Amin, was having discussions with the US. The invasion led to the US boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUS President Jimmy Carter\u003c/strong\u003e, intent on overthrowing the communist regime and preventing the spread of its ideology,\u003cb\u003e supported the mujaheddin\u0026nbsp;with money and weapons\u003c/b\u003e. Between 1980 and 1981, the mujaheddin became stronger with support from the US, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Moreover, they began to organize and coordinate better, delivering more effective attacks against the Soviet troops and the DRA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1985, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\u0026rsquo;s efforts to end the war by bringing more troops resulted in numerous casualties on both sides. In 1986, the mujaheddin became a stronger force, as they were able to shoot down Soviet helicopters using weapons provided by the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe war continued with little progress for the Soviets. This damaged their reputation as the strongest army in the world.

As the country had stalled both economically and politically, Gorbachev launched two important reform policies: perestroika and glasnost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe goal of \u003cstrong\u003eperestroika \u003c/strong\u003ewas to restructure the political and economic system that had begun to fall apart under the Communist Party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomically, perestroika sought to create a semi-free market system by allowing people to part-own businesses and ending the price controls kept in place for the last seven decades by the communist regime. However, this led to social discontent as the new economy did not provide immediate results; moreover, the slow change caused a shortage of food, strikes, and civil unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitically, perestroika meant that the people could challenge elections. Moreover, in later years, other political organizations besides the Communist Party could be formed once Gorbachev opened up the political system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Soviet leader\u0026rsquo;s policy of openness and transparency \u0026ndash; \u003cstrong\u003eglasnost\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; sought to provide more freedoms and rights to the Soviet people through a range of political and social reforms. Freedom of expression was encouraged, but this also led to the formerly state-controlled media exposing the difficult living conditions in the Soviet Union\u0026nbsp;and the corruption and crimes of the government. This type of news caused disillusionment with the communist ideology\u0026nbsp;and the rise of social protests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGorbachev also tried to curb the country\u0026rsquo;s economic and political decline by reducing military costs and improving international relations. He\u0026nbsp;therefore\u0026nbsp;signed treaties which\u0026nbsp;promised to destroy Soviet missiles in Europe\u0026nbsp;and limit their production.
