However, it is generally considered that the Cold War began officially in 1947&nbsp;when American President Harry S. Truman announced <strong>the Truman Doctrine</strong>. The foreign policy stated that the US would provide financial and military aid to countries which struggled under Soviet influence and were threatened with being taken over by communist groups. The policy was based on a broader strategy of Soviet containment, as Truman believed the US should support freedom in those countries that were threatened by Soviet expansion.</p><p>Later that year, the US initiated the <strong>Marshall Plan</strong>, a large rebuilding project across Europe. By 1951, the US had given billions of dollars in assistance, lending vital help for the rebuilding of Europe&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp;The unofficial goal of the Marshall Plan was to contain the growing Soviet influence. However, to avoid creating further hostility with the Soviet Union, the US announced that it was sending help for humanitarian reasons.</p><p>Stalin rejected the aid&nbsp;and influenced other Eastern European countries to adopt the same stance, as he believed American money would help capitalism and hurt socialism. In reply to the Marshall Plan, in 1949, the Soviet Union created the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) to strengthen the economic relations between Eastern European countries&nbsp;and keep them away from American capitalism.</p><p>Communist containment and mutual military protection against the Soviet Union were also the main purposes of <strong>NATO</strong>, an alliance formed in April 1949 between the US, Canada, and 10 West European States. In response, Stalin formed a rival alliance with East European communist countries in 1955, called the Warsaw Pact. The pact was seen in the West as proof of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s dominance in Eastern Europe, as well as of its powerful military capabilities.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="2db70142-adbf-4dab-8f82-7a7721e805ed">The Berlin Blockade</h2><p>Tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies began to grow over their different visions for Germany&rsquo;s future. While Stalin feared a future invasion and wished for a weak Germany, the US and the UK wanted Germany as a future trade partner&nbsp;and hoped it would provide protection against the communist expansion.</p><p>In 1948, after the introduction of a common currency (the Deutsche Mark) in West Berlin,&nbsp;<strong>Stalin limited France's, Great Britain's, and US'&nbsp;ability to travel to their sectors in Berlin</strong> (as the city was located within the part of Germany under Soviet control). This became known as the Berlin Blockade.</p><p>In March 1948, Stalin withdrew from Berlin&rsquo;s administrative council that administered Berlin and began impeding Western troops heading towards Berlin at the East German border. In June that year, the <strong>Western Allies announced their intentions to merge their three occupation zones into one republic, West Germany</strong>. Soon, the Soviet government stopped Allied access to Berlin.</p><p>The Truman Administration then initiated <strong>the Berlin airlift</strong>, a large-scale&nbsp;operation which saw the delivery of supplies to West Berlin by airplane for almost a year. In May 1949, the Soviets reopened the borders. Soon, <strong>Germany was divided into two separate republics</strong>: the German Democratic Republic (or East Germany), dominated by communist forces, and the Federal Republic of Germany or (West Germany), led by the Western powers.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="59a31fff-02cf-46c3-8192-4c888aa4cf04">The Korean War (1950-1953)</h2><p>After the end of World War II in 1945, the dividing line between the Soviet-controlled part and the American-controlled part of Korea was established during the Potsdam Conference. The Korean capital, Seoul, was placed near the dividing line, in the American zone.</p><p>Three years later, the <strong>Republic of Korea</strong> (or South Korea, under American influence), and the <strong>Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea</strong> (or North Korea, under Soviet influence) were established as separate areas with separate governments.</p><p>However, each side began to claim that their government was the only legitimate one, and each asked for weapons and supplies from their respective supporters. The US refused South Korea&rsquo;s request and withdrew its remaining troops from the area. North Korea, which received the help of the Soviets and was supported by the Chinese, saw the opportunity and attacked South Korea, starting <strong>the Korean War</strong>.</p><p>The US intervened in the conflict, and US troops managed to send the North Korean troops back and liberate Seoul. However, the Chinese pushed the US troops back, managing to recapture Seoul in January 1951. In April, Seoul was liberated again, but the city and its population were devastated by the war.</p><p>The US then used strategic bombings to intimidate the Chinese, but also began peace negotiations. In 1953, the war ended under President Eisenhower&rsquo;s Administration through a peace treaty.</p><p>The Korean War was the first major conflict of the Cold War. It was significant in the Cold War as it showed that the US and the Soviet Union were willing to engage in a military conflict.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="ba34500c-0ac3-4cb8-8998-61fa698d2e16">The McCarthy era in the US</h2><p>The McCarthy era lasted from the late 1940s through the 1950s. It was a period in which <strong>the American people were under heavy scrutiny for real or supposed communist connections</strong>.</p><p>The term refers to US Senator Joseph McCarthy, who claimed in 1950 that hundreds of communists were working in the US government. He followed his claims with years of hearings and investigations of people working in the government, as well as in other areas. During the McCarthy era, many left-wing organizations, minority, and immigrant groups, and the American Communist Party were put under surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), an investigative committee of the US House of Representatives, began to <strong>investigate Soviet infiltration in the US</strong>, taking a special interest in people working in Hollywood.</p><p>As a consequence, hundreds of people lost their jobs, and many were &ldquo;blacklisted&rdquo;, meaning they were not allowed to work in the film industry for years. Those that opposed the Committee were also sentenced to prison.</p><p>McCarthy and his practices were eventually exposed in the media in 1954, and he was censured from the Senate. However, HUAC continued its operations until 1975.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="1f01b526-819d-414b-8f62-5a3ed330f777">The early years of the Vietnam War</h2><p>The Vietnam War was fought between North Vietnam, supported by communist countries such as the Soviet Union and China, and South Vietnam, supported by the US. The tensions between the two Vietnamese entities had been building up for years, as the US had repeatedly intervened since the 1950s to avoid a communist government taking over all of Vietnam.</p><p>When the war broke out in 1955 after North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam, American President Lyndon Johnson initially gave the South limited aid, because he wanted the South to fight and win on its own, with as few US casualties as possible.</p><p>However, the American troops in Vietnam were not very effective, not only because of their small numbers&nbsp;but also because of the unknown landscape of the Vietnamese jungles, where they could easily be trapped and ambushed.</p><p>The scale of the US-backed conflict increased in the following decade, eventually resulting in the deployment of hundreds of thousands of US troops.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="da02b51e-193b-4847-a4b8-af37c7960640">The Berlin crisis and the Berlin Wall</h2><p>The Berlin crisis was a major incident of the Cold War, and&nbsp;involved&nbsp;the construction of a physical barrier that would divide Berlin for almost 30 years.</p><p>The crisis began in 1958&nbsp;when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (Stalin had died in 1954) gave the United States and its allies an <strong>ultimatum to retreat their armed forces from Berlin within six months</strong>. He also warned the powers that he would reject the Potsdam&nbsp;Agreement on the governance of Berlin and enter a treaty with East Germany if they did not comply with the request. This happened after many people emigrated from East Germany&nbsp;to West Germany&nbsp;through Berlin, destabilizing East Germany both politically and economically.</p><p>The US, led by President&nbsp;Dwight D. Eisenhower,&nbsp;and its allies feared Khrushchev's ultimatum would lead to communist East Germany taking control of the capital and didn't intend to comply with it.</p><p>This matter was discussed repeatedly, but the discussions came to no conclusion. <strong>In August 1961, the East Berlin government began to build a wall between East Berlin and West Berlin</strong>. The US did not intervene in the building of the wall because&nbsp;the Soviet Union formally had the right to construct the wall in its sector of Berlin.</p><p>The Wall separated the two zones of Berlin and was intended to stop the hundreds of East Germans fleeing daily into West Berlin. The Soviet Union felt that the residents&rsquo; desertion would create a demographic and economic disaster for East Berlin. They also wanted to stop their citizens from knowing how much better life was in the part of the city controlled by the Western Allies.</p><p>The wall was quickly erected during one night with barbed wire and cinder blocks, but this construction was soon replaced by tall concrete walls, defended by watchtowers, patrolling soldiers, watchdogs, and electrified fences. By the 1980s, the wall dividing Berlin was 45 km long&nbsp;and extended around West Berlin for more than 100 km, essentially&nbsp;separating it from the rest of East Germany.</p><p>Nonetheless, many East Germans still tried to escape. Some were killed, but some managed to cross the border in different ways: underground, climbing over barbed wire, or driving through the weak parts of the walls.</p><p>The construction of the wall did succeed in reducing the conflict over Berlin&nbsp;and helped redefine the Allies&rsquo; and the Soviet Union&rsquo;s positions in Europe.&nbsp;The United States and its allies would continue to have influence over West Germany and West Berlin, while the Soviet Union would dominate East Berlin and its Eastern European allies.</p><p>The <strong>US President&rsquo;s speech</strong> from 1963 is a reaction to the construction of the Berlin Wall, and it represents a promise by the US to support and protect West Berlin.&nbsp;Kennedy&rsquo;s speech is a provocative address towards the Soviet Union and the communist system, which he thinks must be condemned and should not be present in Germany.</p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="260cd2ca-3faa-4a68-9677-ffae59d7613c">The Cuban missile crisis</h2><p>In July 1962, <strong>Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev began the shipment of ballistic missiles to Cuba</strong>, a communist country headed by Fidel Castro and bordering&nbsp;the US. This measure was taken after the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion (when the US had attempted to overthrow the Castro regime)&nbsp;and was intended to prevent any future similar attempt. Also, before the failed invasion, the US delivered ballistic missiles to Italy and Turkey, countries that were&nbsp;close to the Soviet Union.</p><p>As a consequence, <strong>American President John F. Kennedy installed a naval &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo; around Cuba</strong>, a type of blockade meant to stop Soviet vessels from delivering further missile shipments.</p><p>The tension between the Soviet Union and the US rose to dangerous levels during the few weeks of the blockade, making the missile crisis a major event in the Cold War. The conflict was seen as <strong>the closest the Cold War came to becoming a full nuclear war</strong>.</p><p>However, the two superpowers were able to reach an agreement, with Khrushchev promising to halt the work on missile sites and the return of the installed missiles back to the Soviet Union.

However, it is generally considered that the Cold War began officially in 1947\u0026nbsp;when American President Harry S. Truman announced \u003cstrong\u003ethe Truman Doctrine\u003c/strong\u003e. The foreign policy stated that the US would provide financial and military aid to countries which struggled under Soviet influence and were threatened with being taken over by communist groups. The policy was based on a broader strategy of Soviet containment, as Truman believed the US should support freedom in those countries that were threatened by Soviet expansion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater that year, the US initiated the \u003cstrong\u003eMarshall Plan\u003c/strong\u003e, a large rebuilding project across Europe. By 1951, the US had given billions of dollars in assistance, lending vital help for the rebuilding of Europe\u0026rsquo;s economy.\u0026nbsp;The unofficial goal of the Marshall Plan was to contain the growing Soviet influence. However, to avoid creating further hostility with the Soviet Union, the US announced that it was sending help for humanitarian reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStalin rejected the aid\u0026nbsp;and influenced other Eastern European countries to adopt the same stance, as he believed American money would help capitalism and hurt socialism. In reply to the Marshall Plan, in 1949, the Soviet Union created the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) to strengthen the economic relations between Eastern European countries\u0026nbsp;and keep them away from American capitalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommunist containment and mutual military protection against the Soviet Union were also the main purposes of \u003cstrong\u003eNATO\u003c/strong\u003e, an alliance formed in April 1949 between the US, Canada, and 10 West European States. In response, Stalin formed a rival alliance with East European communist countries in 1955, called the Warsaw Pact. The pact was seen in the West as proof of the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s dominance in Eastern Europe, as well as of its powerful military capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00222db70142-adbf-4dab-8f82-7a7721e805ed\u0022\u003eThe Berlin Blockade\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTensions between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies began to grow over their different visions for Germany\u0026rsquo;s future. While Stalin feared a future invasion and wished for a weak Germany, the US and the UK wanted Germany as a future trade partner\u0026nbsp;and hoped it would provide protection against the communist expansion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1948, after the introduction of a common currency (the Deutsche Mark) in West Berlin,\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eStalin limited France\u0027s, Great Britain\u0027s, and US\u0027\u0026nbsp;ability to travel to their sectors in Berlin\u003c/strong\u003e (as the city was located within the part of Germany under Soviet control). This became known as the Berlin Blockade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn March 1948, Stalin withdrew from Berlin\u0026rsquo;s administrative council that administered Berlin and began impeding Western troops heading towards Berlin at the East German border. In June that year, the \u003cstrong\u003eWestern Allies announced their intentions to merge their three occupation zones into one republic, West Germany\u003c/strong\u003e. Soon, the Soviet government stopped Allied access to Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Truman Administration then initiated \u003cstrong\u003ethe Berlin airlift\u003c/strong\u003e, a large-scale\u0026nbsp;operation which saw the delivery of supplies to West Berlin by airplane for almost a year. In May 1949, the Soviets reopened the borders. Soon, \u003cstrong\u003eGermany was divided into two separate republics\u003c/strong\u003e: the German Democratic Republic (or East Germany), dominated by communist forces, and the Federal Republic of Germany or (West Germany), led by the Western powers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002259a31fff-02cf-46c3-8192-4c888aa4cf04\u0022\u003eThe Korean War (1950-1953)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the end of World War II in 1945, the dividing line between the Soviet-controlled part and the American-controlled part of Korea was established during the Potsdam Conference. The Korean capital, Seoul, was placed near the dividing line, in the American zone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThree years later, the \u003cstrong\u003eRepublic of Korea\u003c/strong\u003e (or South Korea, under American influence), and the \u003cstrong\u003eDemocratic People\u0026rsquo;s Republic of Korea\u003c/strong\u003e (or North Korea, under Soviet influence) were established as separate areas with separate governments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, each side began to claim that their government was the only legitimate one, and each asked for weapons and supplies from their respective supporters. The US refused South Korea\u0026rsquo;s request and withdrew its remaining troops from the area. North Korea, which received the help of the Soviets and was supported by the Chinese, saw the opportunity and attacked South Korea, starting \u003cstrong\u003ethe Korean War\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe US intervened in the conflict, and US troops managed to send the North Korean troops back and liberate Seoul. However, the Chinese pushed the US troops back, managing to recapture Seoul in January 1951. In April, Seoul was liberated again, but the city and its population were devastated by the war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe US then used strategic bombings to intimidate the Chinese, but also began peace negotiations. In 1953, the war ended under President Eisenhower\u0026rsquo;s Administration through a peace treaty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Korean War was the first major conflict of the Cold War. It was significant in the Cold War as it showed that the US and the Soviet Union were willing to engage in a military conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ba34500c-0ac3-4cb8-8998-61fa698d2e16\u0022\u003eThe McCarthy era in the US\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe McCarthy era lasted from the late 1940s through the 1950s. It was a period in which \u003cstrong\u003ethe American people were under heavy scrutiny for real or supposed communist connections\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe term refers to US Senator Joseph McCarthy, who claimed in 1950 that hundreds of communists were working in the US government. He followed his claims with years of hearings and investigations of people working in the government, as well as in other areas. During the McCarthy era, many left-wing organizations, minority, and immigrant groups, and the American Communist Party were put under surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), an investigative committee of the US House of Representatives, began to \u003cstrong\u003einvestigate Soviet infiltration in the US\u003c/strong\u003e, taking a special interest in people working in Hollywood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a consequence, hundreds of people lost their jobs, and many were \u0026ldquo;blacklisted\u0026rdquo;, meaning they were not allowed to work in the film industry for years. Those that opposed the Committee were also sentenced to prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy and his practices were eventually exposed in the media in 1954, and he was censured from the Senate. However, HUAC continued its operations until 1975.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u00221f01b526-819d-414b-8f62-5a3ed330f777\u0022\u003eThe early years of the Vietnam War\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Vietnam War was fought between North Vietnam, supported by communist countries such as the Soviet Union and China, and South Vietnam, supported by the US. The tensions between the two Vietnamese entities had been building up for years, as the US had repeatedly intervened since the 1950s to avoid a communist government taking over all of Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the war broke out in 1955 after North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam, American President Lyndon Johnson initially gave the South limited aid, because he wanted the South to fight and win on its own, with as few US casualties as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the American troops in Vietnam were not very effective, not only because of their small numbers\u0026nbsp;but also because of the unknown landscape of the Vietnamese jungles, where they could easily be trapped and ambushed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scale of the US-backed conflict increased in the following decade, eventually resulting in the deployment of hundreds of thousands of US troops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u0022da02b51e-193b-4847-a4b8-af37c7960640\u0022\u003eThe Berlin crisis and the Berlin Wall\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Berlin crisis was a major incident of the Cold War, and\u0026nbsp;involved\u0026nbsp;the construction of a physical barrier that would divide Berlin for almost 30 years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crisis began in 1958\u0026nbsp;when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (Stalin had died in 1954) gave the United States and its allies an \u003cstrong\u003eultimatum to retreat their armed forces from Berlin within six months\u003c/strong\u003e. He also warned the powers that he would reject the Potsdam\u0026nbsp;Agreement on the governance of Berlin and enter a treaty with East Germany if they did not comply with the request. This happened after many people emigrated from East Germany\u0026nbsp;to West Germany\u0026nbsp;through Berlin, destabilizing East Germany both politically and economically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe US, led by President\u0026nbsp;Dwight D. Eisenhower,\u0026nbsp;and its allies feared Khrushchev\u0027s ultimatum would lead to communist East Germany taking control of the capital and didn\u0027t intend to comply with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis matter was discussed repeatedly, but the discussions came to no conclusion. \u003cstrong\u003eIn August 1961, the East Berlin government began to build a wall between East Berlin and West Berlin\u003c/strong\u003e. The US did not intervene in the building of the wall because\u0026nbsp;the Soviet Union formally had the right to construct the wall in its sector of Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Wall separated the two zones of Berlin and was intended to stop the hundreds of East Germans fleeing daily into West Berlin. The Soviet Union felt that the residents\u0026rsquo; desertion would create a demographic and economic disaster for East Berlin. They also wanted to stop their citizens from knowing how much better life was in the part of the city controlled by the Western Allies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe wall was quickly erected during one night with barbed wire and cinder blocks, but this construction was soon replaced by tall concrete walls, defended by watchtowers, patrolling soldiers, watchdogs, and electrified fences. By the 1980s, the wall dividing Berlin was 45 km long\u0026nbsp;and extended around West Berlin for more than 100 km, essentially\u0026nbsp;separating it from the rest of East Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, many East Germans still tried to escape. Some were killed, but some managed to cross the border in different ways: underground, climbing over barbed wire, or driving through the weak parts of the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe construction of the wall did succeed in reducing the conflict over Berlin\u0026nbsp;and helped redefine the Allies\u0026rsquo; and the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s positions in Europe.\u0026nbsp;The United States and its allies would continue to have influence over West Germany and West Berlin, while the Soviet Union would dominate East Berlin and its Eastern European allies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eUS President\u0026rsquo;s speech\u003c/strong\u003e from 1963 is a reaction to the construction of the Berlin Wall, and it represents a promise by the US to support and protect West Berlin.\u0026nbsp;Kennedy\u0026rsquo;s speech is a provocative address towards the Soviet Union and the communist system, which he thinks must be condemned and should not be present in Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022 data-guid=\u0022260cd2ca-3faa-4a68-9677-ffae59d7613c\u0022\u003eThe Cuban missile crisis\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn July 1962, \u003cstrong\u003eSoviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev began the shipment of ballistic missiles to Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e, a communist country headed by Fidel Castro and bordering\u0026nbsp;the US. This measure was taken after the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion (when the US had attempted to overthrow the Castro regime)\u0026nbsp;and was intended to prevent any future similar attempt. Also, before the failed invasion, the US delivered ballistic missiles to Italy and Turkey, countries that were\u0026nbsp;close to the Soviet Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a consequence, \u003cstrong\u003eAmerican President John F. Kennedy installed a naval \u0026ldquo;quarantine\u0026rdquo; around Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e, a type of blockade meant to stop Soviet vessels from delivering further missile shipments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tension between the Soviet Union and the US rose to dangerous levels during the few weeks of the blockade, making the missile crisis a major event in the Cold War. The conflict was seen as \u003cstrong\u003ethe closest the Cold War came to becoming a full nuclear war\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the two superpowers were able to reach an agreement, with Khrushchev promising to halt the work on missile sites and the return of the installed missiles back to the Soviet Union.
