Russia&rsquo;s large population of workers was dissatisfied with a difficult life under the Czar&rsquo;s&nbsp;rule. Karl Marx&rsquo;s and Friedrich Engels&rsquo; <strong>communist ideology</strong> (published in 1848 under the name <em>The</em> <em>Communist Manifesto</em>)&nbsp;was attractive as it promised both equality between people as well as a sense of justice. It indicated that the employers who grew rich through the people&rsquo;s efforts should be overthrown by the working class.</p><p>In the communist system envisioned by Marx, means of production such as land, factories, machinery, and tools are not owned by individual people or the government&nbsp;but by the community. The goods produced are divided&nbsp;among people&nbsp;according to their needs. This would ideally lead to a classless, stateless, and property-less&nbsp;society in which there is no oppression and in which people have all the resources they need. According to Marx, however, the transition from capitalism to communism goes through socialism, in which the workers form a temporary type of government meant to seize property from the rich. The Soviet Union was a socialist country&nbsp;because the government controlled the means of production.</p><p><strong>The Communist Party</strong> emerged as an opposition to both capitalism and socialists who had supported capitalist governments during World War I. It was formed from the Bolshevik&nbsp;wing of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, which it formally broke from in 1917, under the rule of <strong>Vladimir Lenin</strong>.&nbsp;The Bolsheviks were a group composed&nbsp;mainly of workers who acted as&nbsp;the leaders&nbsp;of the&nbsp;working class.&nbsp;Lenin, born into a wealthy middle-class family in 1870, became involved in politics as a student&nbsp;and eventually rose to leadership as a fervent critic of capitalism and convinced Marxist.</p><p>In 1917, Russia&rsquo;s&nbsp;Czar, who was seen by the Bolsheviks as the embodiment of citizens' oppression, was overthrown through a revolution (The February Revolution), and a temporary democratic government was installed. Later that year, Lenin and the Bolsheviks organized a second revolution (the October Revolution), which led to the formation of <strong>a communist government led by Lenin</strong>. The Bolsheviks were known by different names in the years to come, until they finally settled on the name the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1952.</p><p>The Bolsheviks, however, were opposed in the beginning by various factions that sought control over Russia&rsquo;s political future. <strong>The Russian Civil War</strong> (1917-1922) saw fighting between supporters of the Bolsheviks, anti-communists, and peasants who wanted to protect themselves and their communities from the warring factions.</p><p><strong>The Soviet communists won the civil war</strong>&nbsp;and the Soviet Union was formed in 1922, through a formal union between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Transcaucasus (later divided into Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia). The Soviet Union was a socialist state;&nbsp;the government owned the means of production&nbsp;(instead of private individuals) and set out to build the classless, equal society that Marx&nbsp;talked about.</p><p>In 1924, after Lenin&rsquo;s death, the party&rsquo;s leadership was taken over by general secretary <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong>.</p><p>Stalin distanced himself from Lenin&rsquo;s economic policies of limited capitalism and started a rapid process of <strong>collectivization of agriculture</strong> (forcibly unifying individual peasant households into collective farms, in an effort to reduce the economic power of wealthier peasants) and <strong>industrialization</strong> (the rapid development of industries).</p><p>However, these two goals were met with opposition, which prompted Stalin to start a process of eliminating his real or supposed opponents. Millions of people were imprisoned, sent to forced-labor camps or executed for treason. The campaign, which lasted between 1934 and 1938, was named <strong>the Great Purge</strong>.</p><p>Although joining was not explicitly mandatory, the number of communist party members expanded considerably during Stalin&rsquo;s rule, from less than 500,000 members to a few million after the 1930s.</p><header><div class="product-embed"><div class="thumbnail"><a href="../animal-farm.html" class="sn-product-thumbnail" title="Animal Farm by George Orwell"><header>Română</header><div class="thumb-title-wrapper"><div class="thumb-title">Animal Farm by George Orwell</div></div><footer>Interpretare text</footer></a></div>

The US had fought against the communists in the Russian Civil War (1917-1923)&nbsp;and refused to acknowledge the communist government until 1933. The US was also worried about the communist expansion&nbsp;and treated it as a serious threat. Moreover, Stalin believed that the US had intervened in WWII too late, leaving the Soviet Union vulnerable in front of Germany. Despite this <strong>background of mistrust</strong>, the leaders of the victorious allied countries &ndash; President Franklin D. Roosevelt (US), Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union), and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Great Britain) were generally in agreement over how Europe would be organized after WWII. However, several events led to disagreements and a deeper mistrust between the Soviet Union and the US, which eventually culminated with the beginning of the Cold War.</p><p>In February 1945, at Yalta, the three leaders agreed to require Germany&rsquo;s unconditional surrender and began to plan <strong>Germany&rsquo;s reorganization</strong>. They agreed that it would be split up between them: the West would be controlled by France, Britain, and the US, and the East by the Soviet Union. The German capital, Berlin, which was in the part of Germany to be controlled by the Soviet Union, would similarly be split into four zones, with each of them controlled by one of the Allied powers.</p><p>In July, the same year, the three leaders also met at Potsdam, Germany, to negotiate final terms for a post-war settlement. The conference at Potsdam, however, was marked by significant <strong>tension between the Allies</strong>, due to several changes that took place since their last meeting at Yalta.</p><p>Firstly, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died&nbsp;and had been replaced by his Vice-President, <strong>Harry S. Truman</strong>, who openly disliked Stalin and communism.</p><p>Secondly, just before the Potsdam conference, <strong>the US had successfully tested the first atomic bomb</strong>, achieving superior military power to all the other countries. Until this test, the US had focused on demilitarizing Germany; however, at Potsdam, the US, now more confident in its military ability and intent on having Germany serve as protection against communist expansion, shifted its focus to rebuilding&nbsp;Germany's economy instead. The existence of the atomic bomb, as well as the US&rsquo;s support for an economically stable Germany, led to further distrust from the Soviets.</p><p>Tension was also brought on by <strong>Stalin&rsquo;s broken promises</strong>. Although he had promised during the Yalta Conference that he would allow free elections in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union took control of Poland and began setting up an undemocratic communist government. Other countries held limited elections, but within several years, they were under communist regimes as well.</p><p>At Potsdam, it was decided that Germany and Berlin would be divided into four zones. Also, the Soviet-Polish border was determined, and Korea was to be divided into a Soviet and an American zone.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="ab74bd19-35a2-48de-a357-f3eeaa17b58a">The atomic bomb and espionage</h2><p>The US&rsquo;s atomic breakthrough transformed the image of the US, making it an even more important threat to the Soviet Union. However, the power of the atomic bomb was not fully grasped by the Soviet Union until&nbsp;<strong>the US used atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki </strong>in August 1945. The bombs killed more than 200,000 people, and destroyed a large percentage of the buildings in these cities.</p><p>Although the official purpose of the bombs was to force the Japanese government to surrender, it is said that President Truman also hoped the bombs would discourage Stalin&rsquo;s ambitions to expand the Soviet Union&rsquo;s influence to other countries.</p><p>Truman&rsquo;s hopes would not become reality - Stalin made developing an atomic arsenal a priority and successfully tested <strong>the Soviet Union&rsquo;s first nuclear bomb</strong> in August 1949, meaning that both of the world's superpowers now had access to these devastating weapons.</p><p>However, Stalin&rsquo;s interest in the bomb was not new. During World War II, he had authorized a research and development program to develop a nuclear arsenal, mostly because of suspicions that the Allied powers were secretly developing a &ldquo;superweapon&rdquo;. The Soviets&rsquo; ability to quickly develop their own bomb was improved by intelligence gathered by spies who had infiltrated an American atomic bomb development project.</p><p><strong>Soviet espionage activities in the US</strong> are also thought to have contributed to the decline in the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. The discovery in 1945 of a Soviet spy ring operating in Canada and the US is said to have strengthened the US&rsquo;s perception of the Soviet Union as a definite enemy.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="e0fbd477-c39a-4a48-a48d-947f65a9bfc8">Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe</h2><p>Despite agreeing to free elections in Europe during the Yalta Conference, Stalin feared that Eastern Europe could turn into a pathway for the West&rsquo;s future attacks. To prevent this from happening, <strong>Stalin began to take over Eastern Europe</strong>, one country at a time.</p><p>In 1945, the Soviets set up a communist regime in East Germany according to the agreement made at the Yalta Conference. The same year, a communist government was set up in Albania, and a communist-led coalition was elected in Romania. The communists gradually took over the country, abolishing the Romanian monarchy. They used a similar strategy in Bulgaria the following year.</p><p>In 1947, Stalin intervened in the Polish elections by arresting the communists&rsquo; political opponents. By 1948, the Communist Party&nbsp;took control in Hungary by force after a non-communist coalition of parties won the elections.&nbsp;The same year, a communist government was elected in Czechoslovakia after only communist&nbsp;candidates were allowed to participate in the elections.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../the-cold-war.html" title="The Cold War" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Cold War</span></a><a href="conflict-itself.html" title="The Cold War the conflict itself" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The conflict itself</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Russia\u0026rsquo;s large population of workers was dissatisfied with a difficult life under the Czar\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp;rule. Karl Marx\u0026rsquo;s and Friedrich Engels\u0026rsquo; \u003cstrong\u003ecommunist ideology\u003c/strong\u003e (published in 1848 under the name \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eCommunist Manifesto\u003c/em\u003e)\u0026nbsp;was attractive as it promised both equality between people as well as a sense of justice. It indicated that the employers who grew rich through the people\u0026rsquo;s efforts should be overthrown by the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the communist system envisioned by Marx, means of production such as land, factories, machinery, and tools are not owned by individual people or the government\u0026nbsp;but by the community. The goods produced are divided\u0026nbsp;among people\u0026nbsp;according to their needs. This would ideally lead to a classless, stateless, and property-less\u0026nbsp;society in which there is no oppression and in which people have all the resources they need. According to Marx, however, the transition from capitalism to communism goes through socialism, in which the workers form a temporary type of government meant to seize property from the rich. The Soviet Union was a socialist country\u0026nbsp;because the government controlled the means of production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Communist Party\u003c/strong\u003e emerged as an opposition to both capitalism and socialists who had supported capitalist governments during World War I. It was formed from the Bolshevik\u0026nbsp;wing of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, which it formally broke from in 1917, under the rule of \u003cstrong\u003eVladimir Lenin\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0026nbsp;The Bolsheviks were a group composed\u0026nbsp;mainly of workers who acted as\u0026nbsp;the leaders\u0026nbsp;of the\u0026nbsp;working class.\u0026nbsp;Lenin, born into a wealthy middle-class family in 1870, became involved in politics as a student\u0026nbsp;and eventually rose to leadership as a fervent critic of capitalism and convinced Marxist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1917, Russia\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp;Czar, who was seen by the Bolsheviks as the embodiment of citizens\u0027 oppression, was overthrown through a revolution (The February Revolution), and a temporary democratic government was installed. Later that year, Lenin and the Bolsheviks organized a second revolution (the October Revolution), which led to the formation of \u003cstrong\u003ea communist government led by Lenin\u003c/strong\u003e. The Bolsheviks were known by different names in the years to come, until they finally settled on the name the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1952.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bolsheviks, however, were opposed in the beginning by various factions that sought control over Russia\u0026rsquo;s political future. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Russian Civil War\u003c/strong\u003e (1917-1922) saw fighting between supporters of the Bolsheviks, anti-communists, and peasants who wanted to protect themselves and their communities from the warring factions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Soviet communists won the civil war\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;and the Soviet Union was formed in 1922, through a formal union between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Transcaucasus (later divided into Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia). The Soviet Union was a socialist state;\u0026nbsp;the government owned the means of production\u0026nbsp;(instead of private individuals) and set out to build the classless, equal society that Marx\u0026nbsp;talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1924, after Lenin\u0026rsquo;s death, the party\u0026rsquo;s leadership was taken over by general secretary \u003cstrong\u003eJoseph Stalin\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStalin distanced himself from Lenin\u0026rsquo;s economic policies of limited capitalism and started a rapid process of \u003cstrong\u003ecollectivization of agriculture\u003c/strong\u003e (forcibly unifying individual peasant households into collective farms, in an effort to reduce the economic power of wealthier peasants) and \u003cstrong\u003eindustrialization\u003c/strong\u003e (the rapid development of industries).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, these two goals were met with opposition, which prompted Stalin to start a process of eliminating his real or supposed opponents.

The US had fought against the communists in the Russian Civil War (1917-1923)\u0026nbsp;and refused to acknowledge the communist government until 1933. The US was also worried about the communist expansion\u0026nbsp;and treated it as a serious threat. Moreover, Stalin believed that the US had intervened in WWII too late, leaving the Soviet Union vulnerable in front of Germany. Despite this \u003cstrong\u003ebackground of mistrust\u003c/strong\u003e, the leaders of the victorious allied countries \u0026ndash; President Franklin D. Roosevelt (US), Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union), and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Great Britain) were generally in agreement over how Europe would be organized after WWII. However, several events led to disagreements and a deeper mistrust between the Soviet Union and the US, which eventually culminated with the beginning of the Cold War.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February 1945, at Yalta, the three leaders agreed to require Germany\u0026rsquo;s unconditional surrender and began to plan \u003cstrong\u003eGermany\u0026rsquo;s reorganization\u003c/strong\u003e. They agreed that it would be split up between them: the West would be controlled by France, Britain, and the US, and the East by the Soviet Union. The German capital, Berlin, which was in the part of Germany to be controlled by the Soviet Union, would similarly be split into four zones, with each of them controlled by one of the Allied powers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn July, the same year, the three leaders also met at Potsdam, Germany, to negotiate final terms for a post-war settlement. The conference at Potsdam, however, was marked by significant \u003cstrong\u003etension between the Allies\u003c/strong\u003e, due to several changes that took place since their last meeting at Yalta.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirstly, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died\u0026nbsp;and had been replaced by his Vice-President, \u003cstrong\u003eHarry S. Truman\u003c/strong\u003e, who openly disliked Stalin and communism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, just before the Potsdam conference, \u003cstrong\u003ethe US had successfully tested the first atomic bomb\u003c/strong\u003e, achieving superior military power to all the other countries. Until this test, the US had focused on demilitarizing Germany; however, at Potsdam, the US, now more confident in its military ability and intent on having Germany serve as protection against communist expansion, shifted its focus to rebuilding\u0026nbsp;Germany\u0027s economy instead. The existence of the atomic bomb, as well as the US\u0026rsquo;s support for an economically stable Germany, led to further distrust from the Soviets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTension was also brought on by \u003cstrong\u003eStalin\u0026rsquo;s broken promises\u003c/strong\u003e. Although he had promised during the Yalta Conference that he would allow free elections in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union took control of Poland and began setting up an undemocratic communist government. Other countries held limited elections, but within several years, they were under communist regimes as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Potsdam, it was decided that Germany and Berlin would be divided into four zones. Also, the Soviet-Polish border was determined, and Korea was to be divided into a Soviet and an American zone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ab74bd19-35a2-48de-a357-f3eeaa17b58a\u0022\u003eThe atomic bomb and espionage\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe US\u0026rsquo;s atomic breakthrough transformed the image of the US, making it an even more important threat to the Soviet Union. However, the power of the atomic bomb was not fully grasped by the Soviet Union until\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ethe US used atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u003c/strong\u003ein August 1945. The bombs killed more than 200,000 people, and destroyed a large percentage of the buildings in these cities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the official purpose of the bombs was to force the Japanese government to surrender, it is said that President Truman also hoped the bombs would discourage Stalin\u0026rsquo;s ambitions to expand the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s influence to other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTruman\u0026rsquo;s hopes would not become reality - Stalin made developing an atomic arsenal a priority and successfully tested \u003cstrong\u003ethe Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s first nuclear bomb\u003c/strong\u003e in August 1949, meaning that both of the world\u0027s superpowers now had access to these devastating weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Stalin\u0026rsquo;s interest in the bomb was not new. During World War II, he had authorized a research and development program to develop a nuclear arsenal, mostly because of suspicions that the Allied powers were secretly developing a \u0026ldquo;superweapon\u0026rdquo;. The Soviets\u0026rsquo; ability to quickly develop their own bomb was improved by intelligence gathered by spies who had infiltrated an American atomic bomb development project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoviet espionage activities in the US\u003c/strong\u003e are also thought to have contributed to the decline in the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. The discovery in 1945 of a Soviet spy ring operating in Canada and the US is said to have strengthened the US\u0026rsquo;s perception of the Soviet Union as a definite enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e0fbd477-c39a-4a48-a48d-947f65a9bfc8\u0022\u003eSoviet expansion in Eastern Europe\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite agreeing to free elections in Europe during the Yalta Conference, Stalin feared that Eastern Europe could turn into a pathway for the West\u0026rsquo;s future attacks. To prevent this from happening, \u003cstrong\u003eStalin began to take over Eastern Europe\u003c/strong\u003e, one country at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1945, the Soviets set up a communist regime in East Germany according to the agreement made at the Yalta Conference. The same year, a communist government was set up in Albania, and a communist-led coalition was elected in Romania. The communists gradually took over the country, abolishing the Romanian monarchy. They used a similar strategy in Bulgaria the following year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1947, Stalin intervened in the Polish elections by arresting the communists\u0026rsquo; political opponents. By 1948, the Communist Party\u0026nbsp;took control in Hungary by force after a non-communist coalition of parties won the elections.\u0026nbsp;The same year, a communist government was elected in Czechoslovakia after only communist\u0026nbsp;candidates were allowed to participate in the elections.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Historical background of the Cold War","MetaDescription":"The spread of communism in Imperial Russia was mainly influenced by the social and economic situation of the country.
