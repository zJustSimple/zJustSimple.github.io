However, their relationship was never easy to maintain as several events since the Cold War have brought up older issues such as nuclear weapons, human rights violations, opposing views on international politics and interventions in elections and military conflicts.</p><p>In 2016, <strong>the CIA, FBI, and the National Security Agency accused Russia of trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election, </strong>for example through&nbsp;attempts to discredit former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the hope that Donald Trump would be elected President.&nbsp;Russian President Vladimir Putin denied being involved in these attempts.</p><p>In June 2017, US Department of Homeland Security officials stated that <strong>Russian hackers</strong> had attempted to find weaknesses in election-related computer systems in more than twenty states.</p><p>Then, in February 2018, <strong>US federal prosecutors charged several Russian individuals and companies for involvement in the campaign</strong> using the influence of government agencies, state-sponsored media, cyber hacking, and paid internet &ldquo;trolls&rdquo;. These&nbsp;efforts were mainly focused on portraying the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, in a largely negative way. The defamation campaign took place on television, radio, as well as on social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, where hundreds of false news stories were posted daily.</p><p>During the investigations, other individuals involved with the Trump campaign and the Presidential Administration were charged with various crimes, from lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian nationals, to failure to register as foreign agents.</p><p>The news of the Russian interference also led to&nbsp;<strong>several sanctions against Russia</strong>.</p><p>In 2016, President Barack Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and six Russian individuals allegedly involved in the presidential campaign hacking to leave the US within 72 hours.</p><p>Then, in 2017, another sanctions bill limited President Donald Trump&rsquo;s ability to ease sanctions on Russia, and Russia responded by announcing that 755 US diplomats in Russia would be ousted from their posts.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump&rsquo;s relationship with Russia and&nbsp;Vladimir Putin often appears ambiguous.</strong> Despite proof of interference from his own intelligence agencies,&nbsp;President Donald Trump at one point seemed to express his confidence that Putin was telling the truth when denying the allegations of meddling in the 2016 campaign. However,&nbsp;he soon changed his statement to mean that he believes Russia did interfere. In other statements, he said that he agreed there was some Russian interference&nbsp;but that other countries probably interfered as well.</p><p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s often ambiguous stance on Russia and on this event, in particular, also created confusion among Americans and in the international community. Moreover, it also created a sense of suspicion among some Americans, as they saw Trump&rsquo;s ambivalence as a sign that he collaborated with the Russians during his presidential campaign.</p><p>Overall, the Russian meddling in the 2016 elections contributed to <strong>an atmosphere of distrust</strong> between the two countries&nbsp;but also inside the US. While some believed that the Russian involvement affected the outcome of the elections, many Trump supporters thought it only slowed down&nbsp;diplomatic progress between the two nations.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="04ca8b18-e0cc-45dd-a69a-8dfd279bf2c6">The conflict in Syria</h2><p>Another recent reason for disagreement between the superpowers is their involvement in the Syrian Civil War.</p><p>In 2015, <strong>Russia supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad</strong> by launching airstrikes in Syria. While Russia&rsquo;s efforts were aimed at keeping Syria&rsquo;s president in power,<strong> the US and its allies repeatedly pressured Russia to remove him from power</strong>, as they saw this as an important step towards peace.</p><p>In 2017,<strong> the US suspended negotiations with Russia over Syria</strong> after Syrian and Russian troops attacked the town of Aleppo. The town was an important element in the discussions over Syria, as it has often been named the country&rsquo;s largest and most important battleground since conflicts between all factions fighting&nbsp;took place there.</p><p>In turn, <strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended a previous agreement</strong> which stated that both Russia and the US should dispose of their available plutonium to avoid the production of nuclear weapons.</p><p>The first American assault against the Syrian government took place in 2017&nbsp;when the US launched missiles into Syria as retaliation for a nerve gas attack that killed 58 people in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The attack was said to have been carried out by Russian jets, but Moscow denied it.</p><p><strong>Major points of disagreement</strong> centered on what factions involved in the Syrian war should be considered terrorists&nbsp;and who should be allowed to get involved in the war. While both the US and Russia agreed that the terrorist group ISIS and its extremist views should be stopped, Russia has received criticism from the US for not doing enough to engage in a campaign of this sort.</p><p>In a similar manner, both nations have had temporary ceasefires in Syria, but the mistrust between them prevented them from reaching an agreement on a ceasefire which would allow them to focus on common enemies.</p><p>Since President Donald Trump took office, the US has shifted its focus from the removal of Assad to combating Iran&rsquo;s involvement in the war. The US continued to pursue the defeat of the Islamic State&nbsp;and announced that it would not get involved in the reconstruction of Syria unless Assad is willing to share his power.</p><p>In 2018, the US demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Syria, although they did not include Russian troops in this demand. Most recently, the US allegedly discovered an Iranian-Russian network which has sent oil and hundreds of millions of dollars to Syria since 2014. This, in turn, was interpreted as proof of Russia&rsquo;s efforts to prevent the US from achieving its goals in Syria.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="d002626c-7b5a-4ebd-8771-237856998053">US plans to leave the nuclear arms treaty with Russia</h2><p>In October 2018,<strong> President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw from a Cold War-era arms control agreement with Russia</strong>. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), signed in 1987 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan, prohibits the use of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles.</p><p>This came as a response to US suspicions that Moscow is developing a ground-launched system which would allow Russians to attack Europe with nuclear weapons. If true, this is a violation of the INF treaty; however, Moscow denied these allegations.</p><p>Trump&rsquo;s statement was generally met with criticism as some feared that a new Cold War era could start once the treaty is abandoned. Moreover, Russia warned about the potential military conflict this could lead to.</p><p>Supporters have argued that once the US leaves the treaty, it could catch up to China in building weapons currently banned under the INF. Because China has never signed the INF, it has been able to develop a large missile arsenal which gives it a significant military power. By leaving the INF, the US could, therefore, build weapons which could deter possible future Chinese a</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="the-end.html" title="The end of the Cold War" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The end of the Cold War</span></a><a href="perspectives/recent-nuclear-threats.html" title="Recent nuclear threats" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Recent nuclear threats</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, their relationship was never easy to maintain as several events since the Cold War have brought up older issues such as nuclear weapons, human rights violations, opposing views on international politics and interventions in elections and military conflicts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, \u003cstrong\u003ethe CIA, FBI, and the National Security Agency accused Russia of trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election, \u003c/strong\u003efor example through\u0026nbsp;attempts to discredit former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the hope that Donald Trump would be elected President.\u0026nbsp;Russian President Vladimir Putin denied being involved in these attempts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June 2017, US Department of Homeland Security officials stated that \u003cstrong\u003eRussian hackers\u003c/strong\u003e had attempted to find weaknesses in election-related computer systems in more than twenty states.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, in February 2018, \u003cstrong\u003eUS federal prosecutors charged several Russian individuals and companies for involvement in the campaign\u003c/strong\u003e using the influence of government agencies, state-sponsored media, cyber hacking, and paid internet \u0026ldquo;trolls\u0026rdquo;. These\u0026nbsp;efforts were mainly focused on portraying the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, in a largely negative way. The defamation campaign took place on television, radio, as well as on social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, where hundreds of false news stories were posted daily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the investigations, other individuals involved with the Trump campaign and the Presidential Administration were charged with various crimes, from lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian nationals, to failure to register as foreign agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe news of the Russian interference also led to\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eseveral sanctions against Russia\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, President Barack Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and six Russian individuals allegedly involved in the presidential campaign hacking to leave the US within 72 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, in 2017, another sanctions bill limited President Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s ability to ease sanctions on Russia, and Russia responded by announcing that 755 US diplomats in Russia would be ousted from their posts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump\u0026rsquo;s relationship with Russia and\u0026nbsp;Vladimir Putin often appears ambiguous.\u003c/strong\u003e Despite proof of interference from his own intelligence agencies,\u0026nbsp;President Donald Trump at one point seemed to express his confidence that Putin was telling the truth when denying the allegations of meddling in the 2016 campaign. However,\u0026nbsp;he soon changed his statement to mean that he believes Russia did interfere. In other statements, he said that he agreed there was some Russian interference\u0026nbsp;but that other countries probably interfered as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresident Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s often ambiguous stance on Russia and on this event, in particular, also created confusion among Americans and in the international community. Moreover, it also created a sense of suspicion among some Americans, as they saw Trump\u0026rsquo;s ambivalence as a sign that he collaborated with the Russians during his presidential campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the Russian meddling in the 2016 elections contributed to \u003cstrong\u003ean atmosphere of distrust\u003c/strong\u003e between the two countries\u0026nbsp;but also inside the US. While some believed that the Russian involvement affected the outcome of the elections, many Trump supporters thought it only slowed down\u0026nbsp;diplomatic progress between the two nations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u002204ca8b18-e0cc-45dd-a69a-8dfd279bf2c6\u0022\u003eThe conflict in Syria\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother recent reason for disagreement between the superpowers is their involvement in the Syrian Civil War.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, \u003cstrong\u003eRussia supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u003c/strong\u003e by launching airstrikes in Syria. While Russia\u0026rsquo;s efforts were aimed at keeping Syria\u0026rsquo;s president in power,\u003cstrong\u003e the US and its allies repeatedly pressured Russia to remove him from power\u003c/strong\u003e, as they saw this as an important step towards peace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2017,\u003cstrong\u003e the US suspended negotiations with Russia over Syria\u003c/strong\u003e after Syrian and Russian troops attacked the town of Aleppo. The town was an important element in the discussions over Syria, as it has often been named the country\u0026rsquo;s largest and most important battleground since conflicts between all factions fighting\u0026nbsp;took place there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn turn, \u003cstrong\u003eRussian President Vladimir Putin suspended a previous agreement\u003c/strong\u003e which stated that both Russia and the US should dispose of their available plutonium to avoid the production of nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first American assault against the Syrian government took place in 2017\u0026nbsp;when the US launched missiles into Syria as retaliation for a nerve gas attack that killed 58 people in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The attack was said to have been carried out by Russian jets, but Moscow denied it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMajor points of disagreement\u003c/strong\u003e centered on what factions involved in the Syrian war should be considered terrorists\u0026nbsp;and who should be allowed to get involved in the war. While both the US and Russia agreed that the terrorist group ISIS and its extremist views should be stopped, Russia has received criticism from the US for not doing enough to engage in a campaign of this sort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a similar manner, both nations have had temporary ceasefires in Syria, but the mistrust between them prevented them from reaching an agreement on a ceasefire which would allow them to focus on common enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince President Donald Trump took office, the US has shifted its focus from the removal of Assad to combating Iran\u0026rsquo;s involvement in the war. The US continued to pursue the defeat of the Islamic State\u0026nbsp;and announced that it would not get involved in the reconstruction of Syria unless Assad is willing to share his power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, the US demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Syria, although they did not include Russian troops in this demand. Most recently, the US allegedly discovered an Iranian-Russian network which has sent oil and hundreds of millions of dollars to Syria since 2014. This, in turn, was interpreted as proof of Russia\u0026rsquo;s efforts to prevent the US from achieving its goals in Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d002626c-7b5a-4ebd-8771-237856998053\u0022\u003eUS plans to leave the nuclear arms treaty with Russia\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn October 2018,\u003cstrong\u003e President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw from a Cold War-era arms control agreement with Russia\u003c/strong\u003e. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), signed in 1987 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan, prohibits the use of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis came as a response to US suspicions that Moscow is developing a ground-launched system which would allow Russians to attack Europe with nuclear weapons. If true, this is a violation of the INF treaty; however, Moscow denied these allegations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s statement was generally met with criticism as some feared that a new Cold War era could start once the treaty is abandoned. Moreover, Russia warned about the potential military conflict this could lead to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSupporters have argued that once the US leaves the treaty, it could catch up to China in building weapons currently banned under the INF. Because China has never signed the INF, it has been able to develop a large missile arsenal which gives it a significant military power. By leaving the INF, the US could, therefore, build weapons which could deter possible future Chinese a\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Putting the Cold War into perspective","MetaDescription":"After the Cold War era, the US and Russia found ways to cooperate both on land and in space.
