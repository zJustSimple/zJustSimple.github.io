And with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election, there is something happening in America.&rdquo; (ll. 12-15).</p><p>By showing the audience that he has the support of many others, he indirectly encourages them to join the other voters: &ldquo;&hellip;nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.&rdquo; (ll. 87-88).</p><p>Obama also achieves this intention by <a target="" href="language/forms-of-appeal.html">appealing to people&rsquo;s feelings as well as by creating ethos</a>: &ldquo;You, all of you who are here tonight, all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign, you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness.&rdquo; (ll. 32-34).</p><p>He portrays his voters and supporters as an empowered majority that wants change. Furthermore, he argues in favor of the power of unity while also explaining his plans for his presidency: &ldquo;...there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill. Our new American majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time.&rdquo; (ll. 38-40).</p><p>Each time he mentions a policy he intends to implement, he uses the first-person plural, suggesting that his plans are in accordance with what Americans want.&nbsp; However, sometimes he also relies on the first person: &ldquo;And when I am president of the United States, we will end this war in Iraq and bring our troops home&rdquo; (ll. 57-58). In this case, Obama conveys his certainty of winning the elections, giving him more credibility and authority and making him more likely to achieve his aim.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="a7cc3d99-e3da-4ba6-9cae-e35d2661021a">Emphasize that he represents change in a historic moment</h2><p>Obama&rsquo;s intention is also to convince voters that this is a historical moment and that he represents change.&nbsp; This intention is first achieved by outlining how many people voted for him:</p><blockquote><p>There's something happening when Americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different. (ll. 21-24)</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;The repetition of &ldquo;there is something happening&rdquo; (l. 17, l. 21, l. 25) &nbsp;helps the speaker convince his audience that Americans want the change that he embodies.</p><p>The idea of a historical moment people are living is also conveyed with the hope of the numerous historical references to moments of change:</p><blockquote><p>It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land&hellip; (ll. 105-107)</p></blockquote><p>Such references are mean to convince the audience that his election will be considered a historical milestone that would change American politics.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="49be26ba-127a-4348-b761-f3b602b25f07">Promote unity and hope</h2><p>To promote unity and hope, Obama uses a diverse range of language devices. He frequently appeals to his audience&rsquo;s emotions and their ability to stay strong in the face of adversity: &ldquo;There's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to, but the hopes that they hold in common.&rdquo; (ll. 25-26); &ldquo;But always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.&rdquo; (ll. 79-80).</p><p>Obama uses ethos to empower people and convince them that hope is the key to a better future: &ldquo;&hellip;you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness.&rdquo; (ll. 33-34).</p><p>Obama promotes unity by showing the audience that people from different groups and categories can join forces to fight common challenges: &ldquo;Democrats, independents and Republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded Washington, who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable...&rdquo; (ll. 35-37).</p><p>For a more effective response from the audience, Obama uses historical examples meant to prove that change and hope are core values that have pushed American society forward:</p><blockquote><p>It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land&hellip;&rdquo; (ll. 97-99)</p></blockquote><p>Once again, the first-person plural helps Obama construct ethos and show the American people that only unity can lead to better lives for everyone:</p><blockquote><p>&hellip;we will remember that there is something happening in America, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation. And, together, we will begin the next great chapter in the American story&hellip; (ll.115- 118)</p></blockquote><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="f14af42f-a2b8-40a3-bc33-777d56020424">Convey criticism of the political class and some industries</h2><p>Part of the speech is also constructed with the intention of criticizing certain aspects of politics and industry. By alluding to current political conflicts, Obama implies that he might be the necessary unifying force: &ldquo;Democrats, independents and Republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded Washington&hellip;&rdquo; (ll. 35-36).</p><p>The speaker also criticizes the Bush Administration by mentioning the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and suggesting that Bush used Americans&rsquo; subsequent fear to win his second term as President: &ldquo;And we will never use 9/11 as a way to scare up votes, because it is not a tactic to win an election.&rdquo; (ll. 63-64).</p><p>Obama trivializes his opponents&rsquo; counter-arguments by using <a target="" href="https://www.studienet.se/yes-we-can-speech-barack-obama/analysis/language/rhetorical-devices">metaphorical language</a>: &ldquo;We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. (...) We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope&rdquo; (ll. 81-85). The speaker also uses other metaphors to take on what he sees as selfish interests in the healthcare and oil industries: &ldquo;&hellip;free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return.&rdquo; (ll. 55-56); &ldquo;&hellip;and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that, while they get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair, not this time, not now.&rdquo; (ll. 43-44).</p><p>Ethos is then used to show that the American people can change economic aspects that frustrated them by electing Obama: &ldquo;&hellip;if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better...&rdquo; (ll. 37-39); &ldquo;Our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it.&rdquo; (ll. 46-48).</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="circumstances.html" title="Circumstances of the &quot;Yes We Can&quot; speech" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Circumstances</span></a><a href="../comments-and-discussion.html" title="Comments and discussion of the &quot;Yes We Can&quot; speech" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Comments and discussion</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
