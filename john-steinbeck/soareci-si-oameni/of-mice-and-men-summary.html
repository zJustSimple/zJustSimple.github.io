Two men, Lennie and George, arrive. It becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability and that George takes care of him. The men are travelling to work on a nearby ranch, but they have a dream of owning a piece of land and growing their own food in peace.&nbsp;</p><p>They reach the ranch the next day, where they meet an older man, Candy. They also meet the boss&rsquo; son, Curley, who immediately dislikes Lennie and threatens him. Curley has a pretty, flirtatious wife.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the other men, Slim, gives Lennie a puppy. George explains to Slim that they had to leave the last place they worked because Lennie stroked a girl&rsquo;s dress and then got confused and wouldn&rsquo;t let go. The girl accused him of rape and George and Lennie had to run away and hide.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Candy overhears George telling Lennie about their dream life. Candy reveals that he has some money he could put towards the scheme and asks to join them. George agrees. The other men come in and Curley starts a fight with Lennie. Lennie hits back, crushing Curley&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;</p><p>While the other men are in town, Lennie and Candy visit the African-American man Crooks in his room. Candy tells Crooks about their dream of owning some land and Crooks offers to come with them. Curley&rsquo;s wife comes in and starts mocking and threatening the three men.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, Lennie is in the barn. He is upset because he has accidentally killed his puppy by stroking it too much. Curley&rsquo;s wife comes in and tells him about how she wanted to be an actress and how she doesn&rsquo;t like her husband. She offers to let Lennie stroke her hair, but when she asks him to stop, he panics and grips harder. He shakes her to make her be quiet and he accidentally kills her. He runs away.&nbsp;</p><p>Candy finds the body and fetches George. They both know Lennie has killed her and that their dream is over. The other men set off in pursuit of Lennie, intending to shoot him.&nbsp;</p><p>Lennie arrives in the clearing where the story started. He has a vision of his Aunt Clara telling him off. George arrives, and Lennie asks him to tell him about their dream. George repeats the story he has told Lennie before and tells him to look away. He shoots Lennie in the back of the head.&nbsp;<br>The other men arrive, and Slim takes George to get a drink.</p><h2 id="heading-8ns4t" title="ID: heading-8ns4t" data-guid="b8e6d670-5c7a-43b3-9734-9d929016d815">Section summaries</h2><p>Note, that in some editions of the novel the sections are not numbered, in other editions they are called chapters and numbered.&nbsp;</p><div class="onpagetoc"><span class="onpagetoc-header">Cuprins</span><ul><li><a href="#heading-8ns4t" title="Section summaries">Section summaries</a></li><li><a href="#heading-nr3p9" title="Section 1">Section 1</a></li><li><a href="#heading-f16x1" title="Section 2">Section 2</a></li><li><a href="#heading-papjc" title="Section 3">Section 3</a></li><li><a href="#heading-xr4cn" title="Section 4">Section 4</a></li><li><a href="#heading-qh2h5" title="Section 5">Section 5</a></li><li><a href="#heading-ekd42" title="Section 6">Section 6</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="heading-nr3p9" title="ID: heading-nr3p9" data-guid="2e24b514-2b48-4f53-a55c-e3971f02ee06">Section 1</h2><p>John Steinbeck&rsquo;s novel Of Mice and Men opens with a description of a beautiful clearing by a river in California. Two men appear. When the larger man, Lennie, drinks from the river, the smaller man, George, tells him off. Lennie asks George to remind him where they are going, and George explains that they are going to work together on a nearby ranch and that if Lennie is asked any questions, he should keep quiet. Lennie is stroking a dead mouse, but George throws it away.&nbsp;</p><p>It becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability and that George looks after him. The two men travel and work together, and they have a dream of buying a small piece of land where they will grow vegetables and Lennie will look after rabbits. The pair cook beans over the fire, and George makes Lennie promise that if he gets in trouble, he will come and hide in the clearing.</p><h2 id="heading-f16x1" title="ID: heading-f16x1" data-guid="7188ff3a-9e02-4ed1-9174-e2ae3b9ed55d">Section 2</h2><p>The next day, George and Lennie arrive at the ranch and an older man, Candy, shows them where they will be sleeping. Candy has a very old dog. The boss arrives and seems suspicious of the pair&rsquo;s relationship. After the boss leaves, his son Curley comes in and threatens Lennie before leaving again.&nbsp;</p><p>Candy explains that Curley can be violent and that he has a pretty, flirtatious wife. George is nervous about Curley and warns Lennie to stay away from him, reminding Lennie that he should hide in the clearing if anything goes wrong.&nbsp;<br>Curley&rsquo;s wife appears. Lennie thinks she is pretty and cannot stop looking at her. A man called Slim arrives and introduces himself. One of Slim&rsquo;s dogs has had a litter of puppies, and George promises Lennie that he&rsquo;ll ask for one. The men go to dinner.</p><h2 id="heading-papjc" title="ID: heading-papjc" data-guid="82fcc5a6-8c6e-4ba4-a17c-47b544e607c4">Section 3</h2><p>Slim and George are in the bunkhouse. George thanks Slim for giving Lennie a puppy, and Slim asks some questions about Lennie. George explains that Lennie isn&rsquo;t mad, but he&rsquo;s slow. George used to play tricks on Lennie, but now the men just travel together. He explains how they had to leave the last place they worked because Lennie stroked a girl&rsquo;s dress and then got confused and wouldn&rsquo;t let go. The girl accused him of rape and George and Lennie had to run away and hide.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the men, Carlson, wants to shoot Candy&rsquo;s old dog, because it smells. Candy is reluctant but the other men think it&rsquo;s a good idea. Carlson takes the dog out into the yard, and the other men sit around awkwardly. Crooks, an African-American man, comes in and tells Slim that Lennie is handling the puppies too much. One of the other men invites George to come out to the local brothel one night.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, George tells Lennie again about their dream of owning some land. Candy overhears and asks excitedly if he can join the scheme. He explains that he has some money and offers to give it to George to buy the land. George agrees and tells Lennie and Candy not to mention it to anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>The other men come back in with Curley, who has accused Slim of having an affair with his wife. Curley decides to pick on Lennie and starts hitting him. George yells for Lennie to hit back, and Lennie grabs Curley&rsquo;s hand and crushes it. Slim sends Curley to a doctor and makes him promise to say that his hand got caught in some machinery. Lennie worries that George won&rsquo;t let him look after the rabbits on their land anymore, but George says Lennie has not done anything wrong.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-xr4cn" title="ID: heading-xr4cn" data-guid="4229fa10-5d4d-44f9-9bba-f3b8b09ad157">Section 4</h2><p>Crooks is sitting in his room in the barn, where he is forced to sleep away from the other men because of his race. Lennie arrives and asks if he can sit with Crooks. Lennie explains that the other men have gone into town. Crooks asks Lennie what he would do if George never came back, but Lennie gets upset so Crooks backs down.&nbsp;</p><p>Lennie tells Crooks about his and George&rsquo;s dream of owning a piece of land, but Crooks tells him they&rsquo;re mad. Candy comes in looking for Lennie and notes that he&rsquo;s never been in Crooks&rsquo; room before. Candy tells Crooks about the money he has for a piece of land and Crooks offers to come with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Curley&rsquo;s wife comes in and starts mocking the men, praising Lennie for crushing Curley&rsquo;s hand and threatening Crooks when he asks her to leave his room. Curley&rsquo;s wife leaves as the other men return, and then Lennie and Candy leave Crooks alone.</p><h2 id="heading-qh2h5" title="ID: heading-qh2h5" data-guid="cbba9f02-210b-4fe7-85af-c70f74578621">Section 5</h2><p>Lennie is in the barn. He is upset because he has accidentally killed his puppy by stroking it too much. The other men are playing a game outside. Curley&rsquo;s wife comes in and starts talking to Lennie, even though he tells her he&rsquo;s not allowed to talk to her. She tells him she wanted to be an actress and that she does not like her husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Lennie tells her about his dream of tending rabbits and says he likes to stroke soft things. Curley&rsquo;s wife tells him to stroke her hair, but when she tells him to stop, Lennie panics and grabs hold of her hair. He shakes her to make her be quiet and he ends up killing her. Lennie half-buries Curley&rsquo;s wife in the straw and then runs away, remembering his promise to hide in the clearing if anything bad happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Candy comes in and finds Curley&rsquo;s wife. He fetches George. The two men know instantly that Lennie killed her and they recognize that their dream of owning land is over. George leaves so the others won&rsquo;t think he was involved and then Candy tells the other men. Slim says they have to look for Lennie and he believes Curley will shoot Lennie when they find him. The men think Lennie has taken Carlson&rsquo;s gun, and they force George to come with them as they head out to find Lennie.</p><h2 id="heading-ekd42" title="ID: heading-ekd42" data-guid="b715a66b-1224-4ca3-830f-dc421a04ea3f">Section 6</h2><p>Lennie appears in the beautiful clearing where the story began. He drinks from the river and imagines his Aunt Clara telling him off. George appears and sits down beside him. They can hear the other men in the woods nearby.&nbsp;</p><p>Lennie asks George to tell him about their dream. George describes the house and land and tells Lennie to look away. He raises Carlson&rsquo;s gun and shoots Lennie in the back of the head. The other men appear. Slim tells George he had to do what he did and offers to take George for a drink.

The men go to dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-papjc\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-papjc\u0022 data-guid=\u002282fcc5a6-8c6e-4ba4-a17c-47b544e607c4\u0022\u003eSection 3\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlim and George are in the bunkhouse. George thanks Slim for giving Lennie a puppy, and Slim asks some questions about Lennie. George explains that Lennie isn\u0026rsquo;t mad, but he\u0026rsquo;s slow. George used to play tricks on Lennie, but now the men just travel together. He explains how they had to leave the last place they worked because Lennie stroked a girl\u0026rsquo;s dress and then got confused and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let go. The girl accused him of rape and George and Lennie had to run away and hide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the men, Carlson, wants to shoot Candy\u0026rsquo;s old dog, because it smells. Candy is reluctant but the other men think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea. Carlson takes the dog out into the yard, and the other men sit around awkwardly. Crooks, an African-American man, comes in and tells Slim that Lennie is handling the puppies too much. One of the other men invites George to come out to the local brothel one night.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater, George tells Lennie again about their dream of owning some land. Candy overhears and asks excitedly if he can join the scheme. He explains that he has some money and offers to give it to George to buy the land. George agrees and tells Lennie and Candy not to mention it to anyone else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other men come back in with Curley, who has accused Slim of having an affair with his wife. Curley decides to pick on Lennie and starts hitting him. George yells for Lennie to hit back, and Lennie grabs Curley\u0026rsquo;s hand and crushes it. Slim sends Curley to a doctor and makes him promise to say that his hand got caught in some machinery. Lennie worries that George won\u0026rsquo;t let him look after the rabbits on their land anymore, but George says Lennie has not done anything wrong.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-xr4cn\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-xr4cn\u0022 data-guid=\u00224229fa10-5d4d-44f9-9bba-f3b8b09ad157\u0022\u003eSection 4\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrooks is sitting in his room in the barn, where he is forced to sleep away from the other men because of his race. Lennie arrives and asks if he can sit with Crooks. Lennie explains that the other men have gone into town. Crooks asks Lennie what he would do if George never came back, but Lennie gets upset so Crooks backs down.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLennie tells Crooks about his and George\u0026rsquo;s dream of owning a piece of land, but Crooks tells him they\u0026rsquo;re mad. Candy comes in looking for Lennie and notes that he\u0026rsquo;s never been in Crooks\u0026rsquo; room before. Candy tells Crooks about the money he has for a piece of land and Crooks offers to come with them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurley\u0026rsquo;s wife comes in and starts mocking the men, praising Lennie for crushing Curley\u0026rsquo;s hand and threatening Crooks when he asks her to leave his room. Curley\u0026rsquo;s wife leaves as the other men return, and then Lennie and Candy leave Crooks alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-qh2h5\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-qh2h5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022cbba9f02-210b-4fe7-85af-c70f74578621\u0022\u003eSection 5\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLennie is in the barn. He is upset because he has accidentally killed his puppy by stroking it too much. The other men are playing a game outside. Curley\u0026rsquo;s wife comes in and starts talking to Lennie, even though he tells her he\u0026rsquo;s not allowed to talk to her. She tells him she wanted to be an actress and that she does not like her husband.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLennie tells her about his dream of tending rabbits and says he likes to stroke soft things. Curley\u0026rsquo;s wife tells him to stroke her hair, but when she tells him to stop, Lennie panics and grabs hold of her hair. He shakes her to make her be quiet and he ends up killing her. Lennie half-buries Curley\u0026rsquo;s wife in the straw and then runs away, remembering his promise to hide in the clearing if anything bad happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCandy comes in and finds Curley\u0026rsquo;s wife. He fetches George. The two men know instantly that Lennie killed her and they recognize that their dream of owning land is over. George leaves so the others won\u0026rsquo;t think he was involved and then Candy tells the other men. Slim says they have to look for Lennie and he believes Curley will shoot Lennie when they find him. The men think Lennie has taken Carlson\u0026rsquo;s gun, and they force George to come with them as they head out to find Lennie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-ekd42\u0022 title=\u0022ID: heading-ekd42\u0022 data-guid=\u0022b715a66b-1224-4ca3-830f-dc421a04ea3f\u0022\u003eSection 6\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLennie appears in the beautiful clearing where the story began. He drinks from the river and imagines his Aunt Clara telling him off. George appears and sits down beside him. They can hear the other men in the woods nearby.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLennie asks George to tell him about their dream. George describes the house and land and tells Lennie to look away. He raises Carlson\u0026rsquo;s gun and shoots Lennie in the back of the head. The other men appear. Slim tells George he had to do what he did and offers to take George for a drink. The two men walk away together.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Soareci si oameni de John Steinbeck | Of Mice and Men Summary","MetaDescription":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck opens with a description of a beautiful clearing.
