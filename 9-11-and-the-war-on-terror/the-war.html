Bush</strong>&nbsp;in his&nbsp;&ldquo;War on Terror&rdquo; speech to the Congress in September 2001 as a metaphor for all measures necessary to deal with terrorism in an unconventional war. The term was never used in any formal document. Initially, the military campaigns focused on countries known to harbor Al-Qaeda cells. As part of the War on Terror, the US had numerous objectives including capturing and punishing Al-Qaeda leaders, blocking all sponsorship and support given to terrorists, defending the US on home soil, and tackling the causes of terrorism. The military campaign included operations in many countries and regions, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, Pakistan, North Africa, Philippines, Yemen, and Libya.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Because the term was widely criticized both by US Congress and international voices, its usage decreased. For instance, the UK (which supported the US war effort) officially gave up the term in 2007. When&nbsp;<strong>Barack Obama</strong>&nbsp;became US President in 2008, he rarely used the term. But, in 2013, Obama declared that the Global War on Terror is over, arguing that the US would focus on specific groups of terrorists and not on fighting a tactic (i.e., the use of terror in general). The Obama Administration&nbsp;also took active steps to retire military troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. However, because of instability in the area, the Taliban reclaiming Afghanistan and the formation of ISIL, the Obama Administration continued to have troops present on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The&nbsp;<strong>Trump Administration</strong>&nbsp;continued the War on Terror using drones and expanding attacks to areas like Somalia with Trump reversing his position against the War on Terror. Now Trump claims that keeping American troops in Afghanistan is necessary. Furthermore, he approved various aerial strikes on the territory claimed by ISIL, which have affected the terrorist group.</span></p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="89a51623-aa37-4ad5-9f1f-3387026f2b32"><span style="color:#1a242e;">Political measures and key events in the US</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Following the 9/11 attacks, the US took a series of political and administrative measures&nbsp;designed to protect US citizens and interests at home and abroad.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">One of these measures was to create a&nbsp;<strong>National Strategy for Homeland Security</strong>. The idea behind this strategy was to implement a cooperation framework between federal and state level institutions, private companies, and individuals to prevent future terrorist attacks.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The<strong>&nbsp;Homeland Security Act</strong>&nbsp;was signed into&nbsp;law in 2002. The act established the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which was designed to gather intelligence regarding domestic security threats&nbsp;but also to distribute funds to areas considered vulnerable to security threats. The act includes provisions regarding key infrastructure, cyber security, and information analysis.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Another important act was the<strong>&nbsp;Patriot Act,&nbsp;</strong>which was signed into law in 2001 in response to 9/11 attacks. The act allowed for the indefinite detention of immigrants, searching homes and offices without people&rsquo;s knowledge, listening to phone records and checking people&rsquo;s emails without court orders.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">On a social level, the 9/11 attacks were also followed by&nbsp;<strong>hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians</strong>, although Bush cautioned people against targeting innocent American Muslims. In the following months and years, many Americans&rsquo; fears and rejection of Muslims grew.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The attacks had a huge&nbsp;<strong>negative impact on economic and financial markets worldwide</strong>&nbsp;while the reparations and the war efforts put a lot of&nbsp;<strong>pressure on the US budget</strong>. In New York City, in particular, small businesses suffered, and the attacks significantly affected tourism and the housing market.</span></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="53a88e10-aeff-4f61-99c3-866d59a7593f"><span style="color:#1a242e;">War on Terror in Afghanistan &nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The US and allied forces offensive in Afghanistan is known as&nbsp;<strong>Operation Enduring Freedom</strong>. This military campaign unfolded between 2001 and 2014.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush gave the Taliban regime an ultimatum asking them to give up Osama bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders to the US government. The Taliban said they would not comply unless the US provided proof that bin Laden and Al-Qaeda were involved in the attacks. The US refused and, together with the UK and other allies, attacked Afghanistan. The Taliban regime was defeated, and a legal government installed, but Osama bin Laden escaped.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The remaining Taliban regrouped and started an offensive at the end of 2002. Battles between the US and coalition troops&nbsp;and members of the Taliban regime continued until 2010.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">In 2011, during the Obama administration, Osama bin Laden was&nbsp;killed by US Navy Seals&nbsp;in Pakistan</span></strong><span style="color:#1a242e;">. After that, peace talks between the Taliban and US forces began. In 2014, an agreement was signed between UN and Afghanistan allowing for US and UN troops to stay in Afghanistan until 2024 to maintain peace. The remaining troops are considerably smaller in number, but they continue to fight against the Taliban.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The war in Afghanistan is the second longest war the US has been involved in, involving both the UN and NATO in the process.<strong>&nbsp;It has also cost the US and NATO a lot of financial and military resources</strong>. Because the Taliban are still fighting the official government and the remaining Western troops, some critics consider the war in Afghanistan a failure.</span></p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="b086c873-9774-4873-a62e-6615c779fa80"><span style="color:#1a242e;">War on Terror in Iraq</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">Iraq has been viewed as a state that sponsors terrorist networks since the 1990s. After the 9/11 attacks, Iraq became the target of the Bush Administration, who considered it to be part of an &lsquo;axis of evil&rsquo; formed by countries that supported terrorism and had or intended to achieve weapons of mass destruction.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The war in Iraq started in 2003 under the name&nbsp;<strong>Operation Iraqi Freedom</strong>. The aerial strikes and ground invasion of US troops were motivated by the suspicion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The attack was a joint effort of British, American, and Polish military and lead to&nbsp;<strong>the capturing of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein</strong>, who was executed in 2006. However,&nbsp;<strong>the US could not find convincing evidence that the government had weapons of mass destruction</strong>. The operation quickly lost popularity with the American and international audience and has been widely criticized. The violence started to decrease&nbsp;in 2007 when the US backed the Sunni group in Iraq. US troops left Iraq in 2010.</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">However, overthrowing the Iraqi government and its leader lead to&nbsp;<strong>instability in the country</strong>. In time, this created the context for some extremists to create ISIL (also known as IS or ISIS), a terrorist 'state'&nbsp;formed in parts of Iraq and Syria. This so-called state was created by an Iraqi faction of Al-Qaeda which split from the organization and invaded parts of Syria.</span></p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="234c5e42-a36d-44de-8a60-a6a11ac4474d"><span style="color:#1a242e;">War on Terror in Syria</span></h2><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">In 2010,&nbsp;<strong>civil war</strong>&nbsp;broke out in Syria&nbsp;between the authoritarian government and various&nbsp;ethnic groups. The war has caused numerous causalities and displaced millions of refugees.&nbsp;The internal instability caused in Syria provided an opportunity for an Iraqi former Al-Qaeda faction to invade and control parts of Syria and Iraq, forming the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS)</span></p><p><span style="color:#1a242e;">The faction ended up competing with its former leading organization Al-Qaeda and adopted a new ideology and strategy which was more brutal and radical. As a response, the Obama Administration in the US set up&nbsp;<strong>Operation Inherent Resolve</strong>, targeting the parts of Syria and Iraq that were under ISIL control.

Bush\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;in his\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;War on Terror\u0026rdquo; speech to the Congress in September 2001 as a metaphor for all measures necessary to deal with terrorism in an unconventional war. The term was never used in any formal document. Initially, the military campaigns focused on countries known to harbor Al-Qaeda cells. As part of the War on Terror, the US had numerous objectives including capturing and punishing Al-Qaeda leaders, blocking all sponsorship and support given to terrorists, defending the US on home soil, and tackling the causes of terrorism. The military campaign included operations in many countries and regions, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, Pakistan, North Africa, Philippines, Yemen, and Libya.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\u0022color:#1a242e;\u0022\u003eBecause the term was widely criticized both by US Congress and international voices, its usage decreased. For instance, the UK (which supported the US war effort) officially gave up the term in 2007. When\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eBarack Obama\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;became US President in 2008, he rarely used the term. But, in 2013, Obama declared that the Global War on Terror is over, arguing that the US would focus on specific groups of terrorists and not on fighting a tactic (i.e., the use of terror in general). The Obama Administration\u0026nbsp;also took active steps to retire military troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.
