Write a proposal outlining the priority areas in which most current teachers might need further training and your ideas for the programme.</p><p><span style="color:#00000A;">Write your proposal in approximately 300 words.</span></p></div><p><u>Introduction</u></p><p>As it is widely known, the quality of teaching is critical in delivering an overall quality of education. The aim of this proposal is to define the need for an in-service programme for teachers, as well as outline the priority areas in which most current teachers might need further training.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes in learning habits, the widespread use of technology, and the expansion of diversity are the main causes that bring about the need for an in-service programme. This should be aimed at our teachers, with the purpose of helping them develop their skills and the quality of the interaction with the students.</p><p><u>Step 1</u></p><p>First and foremost, it is very important to identify and assess every teacher&rsquo;s strong and weak points. This will help in establishing a pattern and will be useful in designing the most appropriate courses and workshops.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, this will not be done outside the working hours, but rather decided by all participating teachers in order to suit their needs and avoid extra effort on their part.&nbsp;</p><p>This trainings can be done bi-weekly, in order to ensure attendance and continuity, which will help teachers develop their skills and enhance their performance in the classroom.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Step 2</u></p><p>Once the teaching patterns are established, emphasis will be put on designing courses and workshops that will:</p><ul><li>increase the awareness of the teachers&rsquo; own behaviour, as well as their behaviour towards their students;</li><li>provide both students and teachers with alternatives within the classrooms, as well as using appropriate strategies, ensuring the involvement of students in problem-solving and critical thinking;</li><li>provide the teachers with the adequate access to resources and helping them develop more effective teaching methods;</li><li>help increase study groups and independent learning among the students;</li><li>help the teachers design their own suitable educational activities.</li></ul><p><u>Conclusion</u></p><p>In-service training is a much needed programme that will help both our teachers and students to reach their full potential in terms of education. After assessing the strong and weak points of every attending teacher, we will develop bi-weekly courses and workshops in order to develop and/or improve specific skills, as well as improving communication between teachers and students.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-fc4er" title="ID: heading-fc4er">Proposal: How to attract a wider audience</h2><div class="meta-text"><p>You are employed as researcher for a young people&rsquo;s TV channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Your manager has asked you to write a proposal on how to attract a wider audience. Within your proposal you should include a variety of different programme types for scheduling, ways the present scheduling could be improved and any ideas of your own.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#00000A;">Write your proposal in 300 words.</span></p></div><p><u>Introduction</u></p><p>Nowadays, more and more people choose online services over traditional television. The purpose of this proposal is to show how our TV channel can attract a wider audience, including different programme types and a young people friendly schedule.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Methodology</u></p><p>The first important step is to research the target audience. This can be done using polls and surveys to understand the viewers&rsquo; preferences. This will help in the redistribution of the programmes throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>The second important thing is to be able to create entertainment programmes to suit the needs of the young people audience. These should aim at presenting current issues of interest for young people, like fashion, relationships. At the same time, we should not omit the educational variable of these programmes.</p><p>We may also seek collaboration with local and national influential celebrities that could guide youngsters through their programs, share their experience with the celebrity lifestyle and give young people advice in a respectful and safe environment. Additionally, we could also contact celebrities that are valued on social media such as Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. This will help increase our audience and youngsters may also participate in these talk-shows via websites, apps, or telephone.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the language use should also be toned down in such a way as to adjust to the public&rsquo;s demands. Of course, foul language will not be tolerated, but slang terms are encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly,&nbsp; these programmes will be redistributed in such a way as to reach the maximum of the targeted audience, specifically in the afternoon/evening periods of the day.</p><p><u>Conclusions</u></p><p>To widen our audience, we have to be able to create entertaining yet educational programmes that deal with issues that are of interest to young adults. We also have to adjust these programmes to their needs and take into account the ideal time for them to be distributed on television.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-2e8wh" title="ID: heading-2e8wh">Proposal: Introducing a &lsquo;dress-down' Friday</h2><div class="meta-text"><p><span style="color:#00000A;">You have a summer job and the company requires you to wear formal dress in the workplace. Last week there was a proposal to introduce a &lsquo;dress-down&rsquo; Friday. You have been asked to write a proposal to the manager analyzing the pros and cons of the suggestion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#00000A;">Write your proposal in 300 words.</span></p></div><p><u>Introduction</u></p><p>The purpose of this proposal is to present both pros and cons of introducing a &ldquo;dress-down&rdquo; Friday, as well as reach the best solution for the implementation of this policy.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Pros</u></p><p>First and foremost, we will decide on what is deemed appropriate and inappropriate for this &ldquo;dress-down&rdquo; Friday and make a draft to lay out the rules for all the employees to agree on. This will help avoid any unnecessary awkward situations, and everyone will know what is and is not acceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, this will provide employees with an opportunity to voice their opinions, express their personal style, as well as their sense of creativity. In addition, this will convey the message that while we are professionals, we are still relatable, thus helping to improve communication with our clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><u>Cons</u></p><p>On the other hand, it is important not to take advantage of this privilege. We should keep in mind the regular dress code our company has, and adjust accordingly. Moreover, during meetings with clients on &ldquo;dress-down&rdquo; Friday, employees will always opt for a more traditional attire, thus upholding the respectful and professional image of our company.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, we find it equally important to avoid translating the &ldquo;dress-down&rdquo; Friday attitude into the other business days, thus demonstrating a lack of office decorum and attitude. This will be done by following the rules agreed upon, hence avoiding attitudes unbecoming. Lackadaisical behaviour, tardiness, nor a decrease in productivity and professionalism will not be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Conclusions</u></p><p>In order to apply the &ldquo;dress-down&rdquo; Friday policy, it is very important that we outline a draft so that each and every employee will voice their opinions and decide on what is and is not appropriate. Once the rules are clearly established, we will discuss attitudes and best practices at work in order to keep our efficiency and professionalism at a maximum level. In addition, this policy will increase team-building and will help everyone interact more with each other.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-b16gu" title="ID: heading-b16gu">Report on work experience programme</h2><div class="meta-text"><p>Un raport reprezintă un text scris de natură formală, adresat superiorilor sau colegilor, iar scopus său este atât de a informa cât și de a propune îmbunătățiri. "Report on work experience programme" este o lucrare propusă și concepută de un elev de clasa a 12-a și tratează un schimb de experiență într-un hotel.</p></div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>The purpose of this report is to present the requirements and the entire activity during the programme, to outline the detrimental aspects of it, and to suggest two ways of improvement for the upcoming such events.</p><p><strong>Requirements and activities</strong></p><p>Regarding the tasks of the workplace and the activities I performed while working in the international hotel chain, I was firstly given the position of the receptionist. Despite possessing the necessary skills in order to properly interact with the customers, this job was not suitable for me. Moreover,&nbsp; this was reflected in my lifestyle as I was exhausted at the end of each day.&nbsp;</p><p>My second experience was working in the hotel's restaurant as a waiter. I managed to collaborate with the kitchen staff and this time the environment was more relaxing for my point of view.</p><p><strong>Problems of the programme</strong></p><p>In spite of it being a truly useful experience, some deficiencies have occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, the organization section was limited to an hour, and I had to cope with difficult situations due to my lack of knowledge and it took a while until I was able to gain some practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the accommodation was provided by a small hotel that was inconveniently positioned on the opposite side of the town. Because of this generous distance, the amount of time spent in order to get to the workplace was considerable&mdash;sometimes even an hour and a half.</p><p><strong>Recommendations&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This type of activities can be crucial in guiding the youths to find a suitable job and, to make them more effective some suggestion should be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the accommodation should be provided by the hotel in which the participants are working.&nbsp;</p><p>By doing this, a lot of time would be saved, and the cases of participants arriving late would be minimal. Secondly, numerous training sessions should be included during the programme with the purpose of giving the staff the chance to work more efficiently and more comfortably.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>I hope that my report has fulfilled its purpose and that my recommendations will be taken into consideration and that future such working experience programmes will be a greater success.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-cm3q2" title="ID: heading-cm3q2">Report on acts of vandalism</h2><div class="meta-text"><p><span style="color:#00000A;">There have been a number of complaints recently from students living on your college campus. They complain of littering on the campus as well as graffiti on the buildings and other cases of vandalism. The students have held a meeting to discuss ways of improving the situation. You have been asked to write a report for the college principal outlining the problem and suggesting ways of improving the situation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:#00000A;">Write your report in approximately 300 words.</span></p></div><p><u>Introduction</u></p><p>As required by this university&rsquo;s student committee, the purpose of this report is to evaluate the repeated acts of vandalism that have taken place on this campus. The report summarizes the current situation, but also suggests ways of improving it.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Outline of the situation</u></p><p>There have been several reports of vandalism around our campus site, including littering, as well as graffiti writing on buildings and other malicious break-ins, thus creating unrest among the students and staff.</p><p>While these acts have not caused any casualties and may often be labeled as a misdemeanor, they bring about more financial investment to get the campus&rsquo; property fixed, with much of this financial burden falling on us, the student body.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Measures to be taken</u></p><p>The first thing to be done is make the student body aware of these intentional and repeated acts of vandalism, as well as the costs and the consequences that these acts entail. By advertising the impact that these acts have on the community, and collaborating with the student body in terms of campus newspapers, councils and newsletters we will make everyone more aware of the implications of such acts, thus aiming at decreasing them.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important measure to be taken is the implementation of more campus police patrol, especially during times when parties and other events are to take place. With this purpose, we should have more surveillance cameras installed around the campus, particularly in the areas of the park, parking lots, entrances and corners, and especially during nighttime and at weekends and other festive days.</p><p>Also, it is important to implement a set of penalties aimed at the perpetrators. Once they are identified, they should also be subject to fines and/or doing community service.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Conclusions</u></p><p>Overall, we believe it is very important to raise awareness on this matter.

This can be done using polls and surveys to understand the viewers\u0026rsquo; preferences. This will help in the redistribution of the programmes throughout the day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second important thing is to be able to create entertainment programmes to suit the needs of the young people audience. These should aim at presenting current issues of interest for young people, like fashion, relationships. At the same time, we should not omit the educational variable of these programmes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may also seek collaboration with local and national influential celebrities that could guide youngsters through their programs, share their experience with the celebrity lifestyle and give young people advice in a respectful and safe environment. Additionally, we could also contact celebrities that are valued on social media such as Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. This will help increase our audience and youngsters may also participate in these talk-shows via websites, apps, or telephone.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the language use should also be toned down in such a way as to adjust to the public\u0026rsquo;s demands. Of course, foul language will not be tolerated, but slang terms are encouraged.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly,\u0026nbsp; these programmes will be redistributed in such a way as to reach the maximum of the targeted audience, specifically in the afternoon/evening periods of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eConclusions\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo widen our audience, we have to be able to create entertaining yet educational programmes that deal with issues that are of interest to young adults.

This will help avoid any unnecessary awkward situations, and everyone will know what is and is not acceptable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, this will provide employees with an opportunity to voice their opinions, express their personal style, as well as their sense of creativity.

We should keep in mind the regular dress code our company has, and adjust accordingly. Moreover, during meetings with clients on \u0026ldquo;dress-down\u0026rdquo; Friday, employees will always opt for a more traditional attire, thus upholding the respectful and professional image of our company.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, we find it equally important to avoid translating the \u0026ldquo;dress-down\u0026rdquo; Friday attitude into the other business days, thus demonstrating a lack of office decorum and attitude. This will be done by following the rules agreed upon, hence avoiding attitudes unbecoming. Lackadaisical behaviour, tardiness, nor a decrease in productivity and professionalism will not be accepted.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eConclusions\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to apply the \u0026ldquo;dress-down\u0026rdquo; Friday policy, it is very important that we outline a draft so that each and every employee will voice their opinions and decide on what is and is not appropriate. Once the rules are clearly established, we will discuss attitudes and best practices at work in order to keep our efficiency and professionalism at a maximum level.
