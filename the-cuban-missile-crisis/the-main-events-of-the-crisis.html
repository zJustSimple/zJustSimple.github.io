However, the missile sites were eventually difficult to disguise &ndash; even though at ground level they could be hidden somewhat, they were recognisable from above.</p><p><strong>One of the missile sites was discovered on 14th of October, 1962</strong>, when an American aircraft took photographs of the site, confirming the existence of offensive missiles in Cuba.</p><p><strong>On 16<sup>th</sup> of October, President Kennedy was informed about the discovery</strong>. He immediately assembled a committee &ndash; known as the executive committee or <strong>ExCom</strong> &ndash; that would handle the diplomatic crisis. The situation was seen as dangerous because the missiles were so close to the US and improved the Soviet Union&rsquo;s position in its nuclear rivalry with the US.</p><p>ExCom had a difficult task&ndash; the question was how to handle the situation without causing a bigger conflict or even a nuclear war. Several courses of action were considered, such as an invasion of Cuba or bombing the Soviet missile sites.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="49ca84b3-5882-469b-afce-e50fe825ef8f">Kennedy&rsquo;s and&nbsp;Khrushchev's&nbsp;approach to the crisis</h2><p>As the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded, US President <b>Kennedy&rsquo;s advisers&nbsp;thought the best course of action was to invade Cuba</b>, believing that the Soviets would not oppose this.</p><p><strong>Kennedy was sceptical of this plan</strong>, as he wanted the US&rsquo;s response to be firm but not to provoke the Soviets, realising that there was a strong possibility of a retaliatory attack using nuclear weapons.</p><p>Kennedy also interpreted the Soviet presence in Cuba as a sign of a future Soviet move to take over control of West Berlin (which was under Western influence). Khrushchev had previously expressed his intention to take it over, and East German and Soviet troops surrounded Berlin. Kennedy knew that the US could provide little assistance to West Berliners in the event of an attack. The US could only threaten with nuclear war, which could have provoked the Soviets to use nuclear weapons against the US.</p><p>Moreover, if the US could not resolve the crisis peacefully and lost Berlin, this would have affected the US&rsquo;s reputation as a superpower and its relationship with its allies.</p><p>Kennedy, therefore, settled on a moderate but firm approach to the crisis. His administration set up <strong>a quarantine around Cuba</strong> that would prevent more Soviets from coming to Cuba and from introducing more equipment to the island. Second, he <strong>requested that the Soviets remove the missiles from Cuba</strong>.</p><p>On 22<sup>nd</sup> of October, President Kennedy also made&nbsp;the discovery of missiles in Cuba public and explained that <strong>the US was ready for a military confrontation if needed</strong>. This created panic among some Americans who, fearing nuclear war, started to gather supplies such as gas and food.</p><p><strong>The US blockade was not challenged by the Soviets</strong>, even though approaching Soviet ships headed for Cuba came very close to it. Khrushchev initially ordered ships in international waters to continue their trip to Cuba but soon ordered them to stop at the blockade. This was seen by the US as a good sign for the development of the conflict.</p><p>Furthermore, note that Khrushchev did not initially want to place missiles in Cuba but later did it to deter the US from invading Cuba, because it was important for the Soviets to keep Cuba under Soviet influence. After the US discovered the missiles, Khrushchev did not see the need for an agreement, as the Soviets stated the missiles were placed in Cuba for defence purposes. However, seeing the US considered the missiles to be assault&nbsp;weapons, he realised the need to call for an agreement to prevent a nuclear war.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="a199ffbd-51e9-4203-aae0-f1003b45e49f">Black Saturday</h2><p>The 27<sup>th</sup> of October 1962, also named Black Saturday, was <strong>the height of the 13-day-long conflict</strong> of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as several events occurred which pushed the world close to nuclear war. Some were known at the time, while others did not come to light until much later.&nbsp;</p><p>On this day, <strong>an American spy plane was shot down over Cuba</strong>. While on a reconnaissance mission over eastern Cuba, the plane was shot down by a Soviet missile. The decision to fire on the plane was made by Soviet generals in Cuba. Even though any attack was against Khrushchev&rsquo;s orders, the generals feared that the plane would discover missiles closely placed to the US base at Guantánamo. Without any time to contact Moscow for directions, the generals decided to fire on the US plane.</p><p>Upon learning of the pilot&rsquo;s death, some of Kennedy&rsquo;s advisers recommended that the US Air Force attack the missile site the next day. Others argued that this called&nbsp;for an immediate invasion of Cuba. Kennedy, however, did not agree to either request. Later during the day, Kennedy agreed that the US would return fire if US reconnaissance planes were fired upon again by the Soviets.</p><p><strong>In another part of the world, a Soviet submarine was attacked by a number of American ships</strong>, which&nbsp;dropped <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;A type of depth charge (underwater bomb)&amp;nbsp;with reduced power. It creates a noticeable explosion, but is not powerful enough to actually damage a submarine. Signalling depth charges are meant to alert a submarine to the fact that it has been discovered, hopefully making it surface and surrender.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;">signalling depth charges</span> on it in an attempt to force it to surface. However, the Americans&nbsp;were unaware that the submarine was armed with nuclear warheads - and the submarine commander was, in turn, unaware that it was not being attacked with actual depth charges. The submarine had orders to retaliate if it&nbsp;was&nbsp;attacked, so the crew&nbsp;prepared their nuclear torpedo for launch against one of the American battleships. However, launch of a nuclear weapon required agreement of all three commanding officers on board - and one man, <strong>Vasili Arkhipov</strong>, was against the launch. Despite an intense discussion, he remained firm, and the nuclear torpedo was not launched. This was arguably <strong>the closest the world ever came to nuclear war</strong>, with the actions of just one man standing against it. Interestingly, the full significance of this event did not come to light until 2002, when the Russians revealed details of the event at a press conference.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="0134bc47-c596-4c6e-ad5f-f5671a9ecaeb">Kennedy and Khrushchev reach an agreement</h2><p>US policy meant that the US should have launched an attack on at least one Soviet missile site after the American spy plane was shot down over Cuba. However, the Kennedy Administration decided not to pursue this course of action, as this could easily have sparked a military confrontation and a nuclear war.</p><p>Despite rising tensions, the <strong>US accepted Khrushchev&rsquo;s demand that the US would not invade Cuba</strong>. Unofficially, the US also agreed to withdraw American missiles from Turkey. The Cuban Missile Crisis saw <strong>its official end on 28<sup>th</sup> of October, 1962</strong>.</p><p>However, <strong>the US blockade on Cuba was only lifted a month later</strong>, after tense negotiations at the UN finally reached an end when Khrushchev agreed to withdraw nuclear bombers from Cuba.</p><p><strong>Khrushchev himself reportedly miscalculated the consequences of moving missiles to Cuba</strong>, never intending to almost cause a nuclear war. He knew that the Soviet Union was inferior in nuclear power, and the communication between Moscow and Cuba was too weak to coordinate a successful attack.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="the-prelude-to-the-crisis.html" title="The prelude to the The Cuban Missile Crisis" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The prelude to the crisis</span></a><a href="the-main-events-of-the-crisis/important-people-during-the-crisis.html" title="Important people during The Cuban Missile Crisis" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Important people during the crisis</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, the missile sites were eventually difficult to disguise \u0026ndash; even though at ground level they could be hidden somewhat, they were recognisable from above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne of the missile sites was discovered on 14th of October, 1962\u003c/strong\u003e, when an American aircraft took photographs of the site, confirming the existence of offensive missiles in Cuba.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn 16\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of October, President Kennedy was informed about the discovery\u003c/strong\u003e. He immediately assembled a committee \u0026ndash; known as the executive committee or \u003cstrong\u003eExCom\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; that would handle the diplomatic crisis. The situation was seen as dangerous because the missiles were so close to the US and improved the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s position in its nuclear rivalry with the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExCom had a difficult task\u0026ndash; the question was how to handle the situation without causing a bigger conflict or even a nuclear war. Several courses of action were considered, such as an invasion of Cuba or bombing the Soviet missile sites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u002249ca84b3-5882-469b-afce-e50fe825ef8f\u0022\u003eKennedy\u0026rsquo;s and\u0026nbsp;Khrushchev\u0027s\u0026nbsp;approach to the crisis\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded, US President \u003cb\u003eKennedy\u0026rsquo;s advisers\u0026nbsp;thought the best course of action was to invade Cuba\u003c/b\u003e, believing that the Soviets would not oppose this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKennedy was sceptical of this plan\u003c/strong\u003e, as he wanted the US\u0026rsquo;s response to be firm but not to provoke the Soviets, realising that there was a strong possibility of a retaliatory attack using nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKennedy also interpreted the Soviet presence in Cuba as a sign of a future Soviet move to take over control of West Berlin (which was under Western influence). Khrushchev had previously expressed his intention to take it over, and East German and Soviet troops surrounded Berlin. Kennedy knew that the US could provide little assistance to West Berliners in the event of an attack. The US could only threaten with nuclear war, which could have provoked the Soviets to use nuclear weapons against the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, if the US could not resolve the crisis peacefully and lost Berlin, this would have affected the US\u0026rsquo;s reputation as a superpower and its relationship with its allies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKennedy, therefore, settled on a moderate but firm approach to the crisis. His administration set up \u003cstrong\u003ea quarantine around Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e that would prevent more Soviets from coming to Cuba and from introducing more equipment to the island. Second, he \u003cstrong\u003erequested that the Soviets remove the missiles from Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 22\u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e of October, President Kennedy also made\u0026nbsp;the discovery of missiles in Cuba public and explained that \u003cstrong\u003ethe US was ready for a military confrontation if needed\u003c/strong\u003e. This created panic among some Americans who, fearing nuclear war, started to gather supplies such as gas and food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe US blockade was not challenged by the Soviets\u003c/strong\u003e, even though approaching Soviet ships headed for Cuba came very close to it. Khrushchev initially ordered ships in international waters to continue their trip to Cuba but soon ordered them to stop at the blockade. This was seen by the US as a good sign for the development of the conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, note that Khrushchev did not initially want to place missiles in Cuba but later did it to deter the US from invading Cuba, because it was important for the Soviets to keep Cuba under Soviet influence. After the US discovered the missiles, Khrushchev did not see the need for an agreement, as the Soviets stated the missiles were placed in Cuba for defence purposes. However, seeing the US considered the missiles to be assault\u0026nbsp;weapons, he realised the need to call for an agreement to prevent a nuclear war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022a199ffbd-51e9-4203-aae0-f1003b45e49f\u0022\u003eBlack Saturday\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 27\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of October 1962, also named Black Saturday, was \u003cstrong\u003ethe height of the 13-day-long conflict\u003c/strong\u003e of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as several events occurred which pushed the world close to nuclear war. Some were known at the time, while others did not come to light until much later.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn this day, \u003cstrong\u003ean American spy plane was shot down over Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e. While on a reconnaissance mission over eastern Cuba, the plane was shot down by a Soviet missile. The decision to fire on the plane was made by Soviet generals in Cuba. Even though any attack was against Khrushchev\u0026rsquo;s orders, the generals feared that the plane would discover missiles closely placed to the US base at Guantánamo. Without any time to contact Moscow for directions, the generals decided to fire on the US plane.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon learning of the pilot\u0026rsquo;s death, some of Kennedy\u0026rsquo;s advisers recommended that the US Air Force attack the missile site the next day. Others argued that this called\u0026nbsp;for an immediate invasion of Cuba. Kennedy, however, did not agree to either request. Later during the day, Kennedy agreed that the US would return fire if US reconnaissance planes were fired upon again by the Soviets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn another part of the world, a Soviet submarine was attacked by a number of American ships\u003c/strong\u003e, which\u0026nbsp;dropped \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A type of depth charge (underwater bomb)\u0026amp;nbsp;with reduced power. It creates a noticeable explosion, but is not powerful enough to actually damage a submarine. Signalling depth charges are meant to alert a submarine to the fact that it has been discovered, hopefully making it surface and surrender.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0022\u003esignalling depth charges\u003c/span\u003e on it in an attempt to force it to surface. However, the Americans\u0026nbsp;were unaware that the submarine was armed with nuclear warheads - and the submarine commander was, in turn, unaware that it was not being attacked with actual depth charges. The submarine had orders to retaliate if it\u0026nbsp;was\u0026nbsp;attacked, so the crew\u0026nbsp;prepared their nuclear torpedo for launch against one of the American battleships. However, launch of a nuclear weapon required agreement of all three commanding officers on board - and one man, \u003cstrong\u003eVasili Arkhipov\u003c/strong\u003e, was against the launch. Despite an intense discussion, he remained firm, and the nuclear torpedo was not launched. This was arguably \u003cstrong\u003ethe closest the world ever came to nuclear war\u003c/strong\u003e, with the actions of just one man standing against it.
