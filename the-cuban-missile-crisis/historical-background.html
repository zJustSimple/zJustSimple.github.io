However, the two nations had a background of mistrust and suspicion against each other.</p><p>The Soviets did not trust the US because it fought against the communists in <strong>the Russian Civil War</strong> (1917-1923). The US kept its firm stance even after the civil war ended, refusing to acknowledge the <strong>communist government</strong> of the Soviet Union until 1933.</p><p>Furthermore, the Soviet leader at the time, <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong>, thought that&nbsp;US&rsquo; intervention in WWII was delayed on purpose so that the Soviet Union would remain vulnerable to German forces. In turn, the US viewed Stalin&rsquo;s ambitions to extend the Soviet Union&rsquo;s influence over other countries as a threat to democracy and freedom.</p><p>In 1945, <strong>the Allied leaders of&nbsp;Great Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union &ndash; had two meetings</strong> which would determine the future reorganisation of Germany. They generally agreed that the East would be under the control of the Soviet Union, while the West would be under the control of France, Britain, and the US. However, between the two meetings, several changes occurred that deepened the mistrust between the US and the Soviet Union.</p><p>Firstly, <strong>the US experienced a sudden change in administration</strong> after President Franklin D. Roosevelt died; he was replaced by his Vice-President, Harry S. Truman, who was openly anti-communist. Previously focused on demilitarising Germany, the US instead <strong>began to support Germany&rsquo;s economic strengthening</strong>. The change was brought about by the United States&rsquo; confidence in its military ability once it successfully tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945. It was thought that an economically strong Germany would be an important trading partner, and&nbsp;would also help prevent&nbsp;Soviet expansion in Europe.</p><p>The relationship between the US and the Soviet Union also worsened&nbsp;because of Stalin. During the first meeting, which took place in Yalta, Stalin promised that he would support free elections in Eastern Europe, but he soon broke his promise by <strong>taking control of Poland and setting up a communist government there</strong>.</p><p>The atomic bomb and the United States&rsquo; new plans for reconstructing Germany altered the balance of power significantly, giving the US the upper hand. The Soviet Union saw the US as a very powerful foe, especially after the US dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Soviet Union, therefore, made <strong>the development of its own nuclear arsenal a priority</strong>.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="cdf435b8-58c1-401d-b417-237bcd8bb30b">The early years of the Cold War</h2><p>The early years of the <a target="" href="../the-cold-war.html">Cold War </a>&ndash; roughly the period between 1945 and 1949 &ndash; were mostly defined by <strong>the US&rsquo; and the Soviet Union&rsquo;s struggle for political power</strong>. Simultaneously, both superpowers tried to limit their adversary&rsquo;s influence over European countries.</p><p>Fearing future attacks from the US, <strong>the Soviet Union</strong> began to invest heavily in developing its own nuclear&nbsp;weapons, while it pursued expansion in Eastern Europe by installing communist governments in several countries. By 1948, pro-Soviet regimes were in power in Albania, Romania, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.</p><p>For its part, <strong>the US</strong> was determined to stop communists from taking over parts of Western Europe, especially countries such as Italy or France. These countries&rsquo; communist parties had gained popularity after the Soviets successfully resisted the Nazi occupation there.</p><p>The beginning of the Cold War was marked by <strong>public statements made by Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill</strong>. In 1946, Stalin criticised the capitalist direction of the world economy and stated that international peace was impossible in these conditions.</p><p>Winston Churchill, with US President Truman by his side, declared that Britain and the US must counter the communist expansion. His speech also included and popularised the phrase &ldquo;the Iron Curtain&rdquo;, which he declared had fallen across the European continent, definitively dividing the East and the West politically and ideologically.</p><p>One of the first measures implemented by the US to stop the communist expansion was a policy named <strong>&ldquo;the Truman Doctrine&rdquo;</strong> (1947). Under this policy, the US effectively prevented Greece and Turkey from falling under Soviet control by providing them with financial and military aid.</p><p>In 1948, <strong>the Marshall Plan</strong> was initiated to help the economies of nations in Western Europe. As these economies improved, the communist parties lost their influence in Western Europe.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>the Soviet Union used its resources and military power in central and Eastern Europe to hinder democratic efforts</strong> in several countries and place them under communist control. Furthermore<strong>, Stalin rejected US aid and constrained other Eastern European countries to do the same</strong>, fearing that economic and financial help from the US would encourage the development of capitalism.</p><p>In June 1948, Stalin initiated <strong>the Berlin Blockade,</strong> blocking France, the US, and Great Britain from travelling to their sectors in Berlin (as the divided city was located within the area controlled by the Soviets). President Truman ordered the Berlin airlift, an operation to deliver supplies to West Berlin by plane, which lasted for more than 300 days. The blockade was officially lifted in May 1949, and <strong>Germany was soon separated into two republics</strong>: East Germany, led by communist forces, and West Germany, controlled by the Western powers.</p><p>In response to the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union created its own alliance, <strong>the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON)</strong>, in 1949. COMECON was intended to strengthen economic relations between Eastern European countries.</p><p>In 1949, the US, Canada, and 10 western European states also formed <strong>NATO</strong>, an alliance meant to provide mutual military protection against the Soviet Union and contain its expansion in Europe. Six years later, the Soviet Union replied by forming a rival alliance, called <strong>the Warsaw Pact</strong>, with Communist countries in eastern Europe.</p><p><div class="product-embed"><div class="thumbnail"><a href="../bacalaureat/economie/2014/iunie-iulie.html" class="sn-product-thumbnail" title="Bacalaureat Economie 2014 sesiunea iunie-iulie"><header>Alte materii</header><div class="thumb-title-wrapper"><div class="thumb-title">Bacalaureat Economie 2014 sesiunea iunie-iulie</div></div><footer>Rezolvare Bac</footer></a></div>

Until 1940, when he first became president himself, Batista ruled Cuba through his influence over two presidents.</p><p>During Batista&rsquo;s first presidential term (1940-1944), <strong>Cuba established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union</strong> while fighting on the Allies&rsquo; side in World War II.</p><p>Batista was elected president again in 1955, after he overthrew the previous government in 1952 and asked for elections in 1954. The population, however, grew to oppose him, as he did not succeed in stabilising Cuba, which was confronted with high levels of unemployment, corruption, and limited infrastructure.</p><p>Batista proved to be less concerned with the issues faced by Cubans than in his previous term. Furthermore, <strong>Batista&rsquo;s policies favoured American companies&rsquo; influence in Cuba&rsquo;s economy</strong>, creating an unstable future for local producers of sugar and other products meant for export.</p><p><strong>Fidel Castro</strong>, then a young activist and lawyer, challenged Batista&rsquo;s presidency through legal means but was unsuccessful. Realising that more forceful measures had to be taken to remove Batista from power, Castro began to plan a revolution.</p><p>Together with his brother Raúl, Fidel Castro recruited opponents of the Batista regime from the working class and began to gather weapons under what was called <strong>The Movement</strong>. The Movement led its first attack on 26<sup>th</sup> of July, 1953, on army barracks in Santiago and Bayamo. The attack was unsuccessful, and Castro and his brother were imprisoned. After his release in 1955, Fidel left for Mexico, where he began to plan another attempt to overthrow Batista.</p><p>Castro returned to Cuba in 1956 accompanied by more than 80 men, but his fellow revolutionaries were captured or killed. Castro, his brother, and Ernesto &ldquo;Che&rdquo; Guevara escaped to the mountains. They changed the name of the movement to <strong>the 26<sup>th</sup> of July Movement</strong> in memory of the 1953 attack and began to build a guerrilla army with the help of local supporters.</p><p>Other factions would rise against Batista in the following years, but they were defeated by government forces, often leaving behind many victims. Batista, who felt that the opposition to his regime was growing, banned freedom of expression and freedom of assembly to prevent other groups from organising against him.</p><p><strong>The revolution continued in 1958</strong>, with increasingly violent civil unrest affecting the economy, its tourism, and the Cuban people&rsquo;s daily lives. The US, which at first supported Batista but came to recognise him as a corrupt leader, responded to the growing violence by <strong>suspending the delivery of weapons to Cuba</strong>.</p><p>After unsuccessful attacks against Batista and planned strikes that were not carried out, he came to the conclusion that the revolutionary forces were weak. Consequently, <strong>Batista launched an attack on the 26<sup>th</sup> of July forces</strong> that were still in the mountains. However, he encountered strong opposition and had to retreat.</p><p><strong>Castro himself became more aggressive in his actions</strong>, calling for strikes and sending death threats to political candidates, and even resorting to kidnapping US and Canadian sailors and civilians to force intervention from the US. However, he quickly released them fearing US retaliation.</p><p><strong>The American embargo on ammunition affected Batista&rsquo;s army</strong>. Meanwhile, Castro&rsquo;s forces became stronger by obtaining military equipment from foreign sources, but also by robbing weapon shipments meant for government forces.</p><p>After defeating Batista&rsquo;s offensive, the 26<sup>th</sup> of July group began an offensive of their own. They obtained important victories by capturing several towns. <strong>Batista eventually fled to the Dominican Republic in the early days of 1959, handing over the power to a general</strong> who went on to establish a provisional government.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="477b0972-3cc0-4cfc-a02e-0792cf595d00">Fidel Castro&rsquo;s rise to power</h2><p>A few days after Batista fled, <strong>Fidel Castro</strong> arrived in Cuba&rsquo;s capital, Havana arrested the general who led the provisional government after Batista flew from Cuba and <strong>proclaimed himself Representative of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency</strong>. He took on the role of Prime Minister of Cuba.</p><p>In the aftermath of the revolution, people involved in the Batista regime were put on trial, imprisoned, or executed. <strong>The relationship with the US was tense, even though the US recognised the Castro regime</strong>. In April 1959, Castro visited the US and reportedly stated that Cuba would remain neutral in all conflicts between the Soviet Union and the US. Castro claimed he was not a communist and would continue to make this claim for years.</p><p>Castro quickly introduced a number of <strong>reforms in Cuba</strong>, meant to eliminate discrimination against Afro-Cubans and improve Cuban people&rsquo;s lives through better education, health, housing, etc. However, he also focused heavily on preventing counter-revolutionary activity, essentially keeping a close eye on the citizens&rsquo; activities through neighbourhood committees of informants.</p><p>In February 1960, <strong>Cuba signed a trade pact with the Soviet Union</strong>, and Castro soon publicly stated his support for Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (who took power after Stalin&rsquo;s death in 1953), while denouncing the US. As the US was unwilling to provide Cuba with financial help, by 1961, much of the private property in Cuba &ndash; including foreign-owned property &ndash; was transferred to state ownership and taxes were raised.</p><p>Also, in 1961, the 26<sup>th</sup> of July Movement, the People&rsquo;s Socialist Party, and the Revolutionary Directorate formed the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (IRO), which eventually became <strong>the Communist Party of Cuba</strong> in 1965.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../the-cuban-missile-crisis.html" title="The Cuban Missile Crisis" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Cuban Missile Crisis</span></a><a href="the-prelude-to-the-crisis.html" title="The prelude to the The Cuban Missile Crisis" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The prelude to the crisis</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, the two nations had a background of mistrust and suspicion against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Soviets did not trust the US because it fought against the communists in \u003cstrong\u003ethe Russian Civil War\u003c/strong\u003e (1917-1923). The US kept its firm stance even after the civil war ended, refusing to acknowledge the \u003cstrong\u003ecommunist government\u003c/strong\u003e of the Soviet Union until 1933.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Soviet leader at the time, \u003cstrong\u003eJoseph Stalin\u003c/strong\u003e, thought that\u0026nbsp;US\u0026rsquo; intervention in WWII was delayed on purpose so that the Soviet Union would remain vulnerable to German forces. In turn, the US viewed Stalin\u0026rsquo;s ambitions to extend the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s influence over other countries as a threat to democracy and freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1945, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Allied leaders of\u0026nbsp;Great Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union \u0026ndash; had two meetings\u003c/strong\u003e which would determine the future reorganisation of Germany. They generally agreed that the East would be under the control of the Soviet Union, while the West would be under the control of France, Britain, and the US. However, between the two meetings, several changes occurred that deepened the mistrust between the US and the Soviet Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirstly, \u003cstrong\u003ethe US experienced a sudden change in administration\u003c/strong\u003e after President Franklin D. Roosevelt died; he was replaced by his Vice-President, Harry S. Truman, who was openly anti-communist. Previously focused on demilitarising Germany, the US instead \u003cstrong\u003ebegan to support Germany\u0026rsquo;s economic strengthening\u003c/strong\u003e. The change was brought about by the United States\u0026rsquo; confidence in its military ability once it successfully tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945. It was thought that an economically strong Germany would be an important trading partner, and\u0026nbsp;would also help prevent\u0026nbsp;Soviet expansion in Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between the US and the Soviet Union also worsened\u0026nbsp;because of Stalin. During the first meeting, which took place in Yalta, Stalin promised that he would support free elections in Eastern Europe, but he soon broke his promise by \u003cstrong\u003etaking control of Poland and setting up a communist government there\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe atomic bomb and the United States\u0026rsquo; new plans for reconstructing Germany altered the balance of power significantly, giving the US the upper hand. The Soviet Union saw the US as a very powerful foe, especially after the US dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Soviet Union, therefore, made \u003cstrong\u003ethe development of its own nuclear arsenal a priority\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022cdf435b8-58c1-401d-b417-237bcd8bb30b\u0022\u003eThe early years of the Cold War\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe early years of the \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/the-cold-war\u0022\u003eCold War \u003c/a\u003e\u0026ndash; roughly the period between 1945 and 1949 \u0026ndash; were mostly defined by \u003cstrong\u003ethe US\u0026rsquo; and the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s struggle for political power\u003c/strong\u003e. Simultaneously, both superpowers tried to limit their adversary\u0026rsquo;s influence over European countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFearing future attacks from the US, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Soviet Union\u003c/strong\u003e began to invest heavily in developing its own nuclear\u0026nbsp;weapons, while it pursued expansion in Eastern Europe by installing communist governments in several countries. By 1948, pro-Soviet regimes were in power in Albania, Romania, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor its part, \u003cstrong\u003ethe US\u003c/strong\u003e was determined to stop communists from taking over parts of Western Europe, especially countries such as Italy or France. These countries\u0026rsquo; communist parties had gained popularity after the Soviets successfully resisted the Nazi occupation there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beginning of the Cold War was marked by \u003cstrong\u003epublic statements made by Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\u003c/strong\u003e. In 1946, Stalin criticised the capitalist direction of the world economy and stated that international peace was impossible in these conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWinston Churchill, with US President Truman by his side, declared that Britain and the US must counter the communist expansion. His speech also included and popularised the phrase \u0026ldquo;the Iron Curtain\u0026rdquo;, which he declared had fallen across the European continent, definitively dividing the East and the West politically and ideologically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first measures implemented by the US to stop the communist expansion was a policy named \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;the Truman Doctrine\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e (1947). Under this policy, the US effectively prevented Greece and Turkey from falling under Soviet control by providing them with financial and military aid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1948, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Marshall Plan\u003c/strong\u003e was initiated to help the economies of nations in Western Europe. As these economies improved, the communist parties lost their influence in Western Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Soviet Union used its resources and military power in central and Eastern Europe to hinder democratic efforts\u003c/strong\u003e in several countries and place them under communist control. Furthermore\u003cstrong\u003e, Stalin rejected US aid and constrained other Eastern European countries to do the same\u003c/strong\u003e, fearing that economic and financial help from the US would encourage the development of capitalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June 1948, Stalin initiated \u003cstrong\u003ethe Berlin Blockade,\u003c/strong\u003e blocking France, the US, and Great Britain from travelling to their sectors in Berlin (as the divided city was located within the area controlled by the Soviets). President Truman ordered the Berlin airlift, an operation to deliver supplies to West Berlin by plane, which lasted for more than 300 days. The blockade was officially lifted in May 1949, and \u003cstrong\u003eGermany was soon separated into two republics\u003c/strong\u003e: East Germany, led by communist forces, and West Germany, controlled by the Western powers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn response to the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union created its own alliance, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON)\u003c/strong\u003e, in 1949. COMECON was intended to strengthen economic relations between Eastern European countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1949, the US, Canada, and 10 western European states also formed \u003cstrong\u003eNATO\u003c/strong\u003e, an alliance meant to provide mutual military protection against the Soviet Union and contain its expansion in Europe. Six years later, the Soviet Union replied by forming a rival alliance, called \u003cstrong\u003ethe Warsaw Pact\u003c/strong\u003e, with Communist countries in eastern Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022product-embed\u0022\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022thumbnail\u0022\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022/bacalaureat/economie/2014/iunie-iulie\u0022 class=\u0022sn-product-thumbnail\u0022 title=\u0022Bacalaureat Economie 2014 sesiunea iunie-iulie\u0022\u003e\u003cheader\u003eAlte materii\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022thumb-title-wrapper\u0022\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022thumb-title\u0022\u003eBacalaureat Economie 2014 sesiunea iunie-iulie\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfooter\u003eRezolvare Bac\u003c/footer\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                            \u003cdiv class=\u0022text\u0022\u003e\n                                \u003ca href=\u0022/bacalaureat/economie/2014/iunie-iulie\u0022 class=\u0022title\u0022 title=\u0022Bacalaureat Economie 2014 sesiunea iunie-iulie\u0022\u003eBacalaureat Economie 2014 sesiunea iunie-iulie\u003c/a\u003e\n                                \u003cp\u003e\n                                    You can find much more information about the Cold War in our in-depth topic guide.\n                                \u003c/p\u003e\n                            \u003c/div\u003e\n                            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00227c0b0804-93a8-46c8-8e76-d78ac248c6d3\u0022\u003eThe Cuban revolution\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the years leading up to the Cuban Revolution (1953-1959), Cuba was led by \u003cstrong\u003eFulgencio Batista y Zaldívar\u003c/strong\u003e, a former sergeant who rose to power by gaining control of the Cuban army while the country\u0026rsquo;s first dictator, former General Gerardo Machado y Morales, was forced to flee the country in 1933. Until 1940, when he first became president himself, Batista ruled Cuba through his influence over two presidents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring Batista\u0026rsquo;s first presidential term (1940-1944), \u003cstrong\u003eCuba established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union\u003c/strong\u003e while fighting on the Allies\u0026rsquo; side in World War II.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBatista was elected president again in 1955, after he overthrew the previous government in 1952 and asked for elections in 1954. The population, however, grew to oppose him, as he did not succeed in stabilising Cuba, which was confronted with high levels of unemployment, corruption, and limited infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBatista proved to be less concerned with the issues faced by Cubans than in his previous term. Furthermore, \u003cstrong\u003eBatista\u0026rsquo;s policies favoured American companies\u0026rsquo; influence in Cuba\u0026rsquo;s economy\u003c/strong\u003e, creating an unstable future for local producers of sugar and other products meant for export.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFidel Castro\u003c/strong\u003e, then a young activist and lawyer, challenged Batista\u0026rsquo;s presidency through legal means but was unsuccessful. Realising that more forceful measures had to be taken to remove Batista from power, Castro began to plan a revolution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTogether with his brother Raúl, Fidel Castro recruited opponents of the Batista regime from the working class and began to gather weapons under what was called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Movement\u003c/strong\u003e. The Movement led its first attack on 26\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of July, 1953, on army barracks in Santiago and Bayamo. The attack was unsuccessful, and Castro and his brother were imprisoned. After his release in 1955, Fidel left for Mexico, where he began to plan another attempt to overthrow Batista.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCastro returned to Cuba in 1956 accompanied by more than 80 men, but his fellow revolutionaries were captured or killed. Castro, his brother, and Ernesto \u0026ldquo;Che\u0026rdquo; Guevara escaped to the mountains. They changed the name of the movement to \u003cstrong\u003ethe 26\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of July Movement\u003c/strong\u003e in memory of the 1953 attack and began to build a guerrilla army with the help of local supporters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther factions would rise against Batista in the following years, but they were defeated by government forces, often leaving behind many victims. Batista, who felt that the opposition to his regime was growing, banned freedom of expression and freedom of assembly to prevent other groups from organising against him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe revolution continued in 1958\u003c/strong\u003e, with increasingly violent civil unrest affecting the economy, its tourism, and the Cuban people\u0026rsquo;s daily lives. The US, which at first supported Batista but came to recognise him as a corrupt leader, responded to the growing violence by \u003cstrong\u003esuspending the delivery of weapons to Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter unsuccessful attacks against Batista and planned strikes that were not carried out, he came to the conclusion that the revolutionary forces were weak. Consequently, \u003cstrong\u003eBatista launched an attack on the 26\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of July forces\u003c/strong\u003e that were still in the mountains. However, he encountered strong opposition and had to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCastro himself became more aggressive in his actions\u003c/strong\u003e, calling for strikes and sending death threats to political candidates, and even resorting to kidnapping US and Canadian sailors and civilians to force intervention from the US. However, he quickly released them fearing US retaliation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe American embargo on ammunition affected Batista\u0026rsquo;s army\u003c/strong\u003e. Meanwhile, Castro\u0026rsquo;s forces became stronger by obtaining military equipment from foreign sources, but also by robbing weapon shipments meant for government forces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter defeating Batista\u0026rsquo;s offensive, the 26\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of July group began an offensive of their own. They obtained important victories by capturing several towns. \u003cstrong\u003eBatista eventually fled to the Dominican Republic in the early days of 1959, handing over the power to a general\u003c/strong\u003e who went on to establish a provisional government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022477b0972-3cc0-4cfc-a02e-0792cf595d00\u0022\u003eFidel Castro\u0026rsquo;s rise to power\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few days after Batista fled, \u003cstrong\u003eFidel Castro\u003c/strong\u003e arrived in Cuba\u0026rsquo;s capital, Havana arrested the general who led the provisional government after Batista flew from Cuba and \u003cstrong\u003eproclaimed himself Representative of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency\u003c/strong\u003e. He took on the role of Prime Minister of Cuba.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the aftermath of the revolution, people involved in the Batista regime were put on trial, imprisoned, or executed. \u003cstrong\u003eThe relationship with the US was tense, even though the US recognised the Castro regime\u003c/strong\u003e. In April 1959, Castro visited the US and reportedly stated that Cuba would remain neutral in all conflicts between the Soviet Union and the US. Castro claimed he was not a communist and would continue to make this claim for years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCastro quickly introduced a number of \u003cstrong\u003ereforms in Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e, meant to eliminate discrimination against Afro-Cubans and improve Cuban people\u0026rsquo;s lives through better education, health, housing, etc. However, he also focused heavily on preventing counter-revolutionary activity, essentially keeping a close eye on the citizens\u0026rsquo; activities through neighbourhood committees of informants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February 1960, \u003cstrong\u003eCuba signed a trade pact with the Soviet Union\u003c/strong\u003e, and Castro soon publicly stated his support for Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (who took power after Stalin\u0026rsquo;s death in 1953), while denouncing the US. As the US was unwilling to provide Cuba with financial help, by 1961, much of the private property in Cuba \u0026ndash; including foreign-owned property \u0026ndash; was transferred to state ownership and taxes were raised.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, in 1961, the 26\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of July Movement, the People\u0026rsquo;s Socialist Party, and the Revolutionary Directorate formed the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (IRO), which eventually became \u003cstrong\u003ethe Communist Party of Cuba\u003c/strong\u003e in 1965.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Historical background of The Cuban Missile Crisis","MetaDescription":"During World War II (1939-1945), the Soviet Union and the United States fought as allies against Germany.
