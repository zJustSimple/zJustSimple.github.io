Kennedy (1917-1963)</h2><p>John F. Kennedy served as the 35<sup>th</sup> President of the US from 1961 until 1963, when he was assassinated. A <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;In the US, Democrats are members of the Democratic Party. The Democrat Party is a&amp;nbsp;historic US political party that advocates for economic and social equality, and believes that the government should be involved in social and economic matters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;">Democrat</span>, Kennedy previously represented Massachusetts in US Congress.</p><p><strong>Before the Cuban Missile Crisis took place, Kennedy publicly stated that he would not protest against the placement of defensive weapons in Cuba</strong>, but he promised a swift and harsh response if offensive weapons were introduced.</p><p>This statement would later prove problematic when dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis, as Kennedy did not want to seem weak by making compromises with the Soviets. However, he knew that a forceful response could also cause the Soviets to retaliate, most likely by using nuclear weapons.</p><p>The failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, on which Kennedy consulted only a small number of people, led Kennedy to <strong>consult more widely</strong> during the Cuban Missile Crisis by creating the ExCom committee.</p><p>The invasion&rsquo;s failure also strengthened his resolve to remove Cuban leader Fidel Castro from power. The Administration subsequently launched <strong>Operation Mongoose</strong>, a secret plan in which the possibility of assassinating Castro was also taken into consideration.</p><p>Kennedy took office with the <strong>intention to eradicate poverty in the US and support its space explorations</strong>. He was also <strong>a supporter of <a target="" href="../../the-civil-rights-movement.html">the civil rights movement</a>,</strong> but was mostly unsuccessful in passing relevant policies for his goals before his death. However, Congress would pass many of his proposals after his death, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and he remains one of the best-liked US presidents of all time.</p><p>On 22<sup>nd</sup> of November 1963, Kennedy was <strong>assassinated</strong> in Dallas, Texas.</p><h2 data-guid="614aabae-1c68-4bc6-bf8a-3cf9a198b45d" id="heading-2">Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968)</h2><p>Robert F. Kennedy was an American lawyer and politician who served as a US Attorney General from 1961 to 1964 and as a US Senator from 1965 until 1968.</p><p>Like his brother, John F. Kennedy, Robert was a Democrat&nbsp;who held an important role in the Cuban Missile Crisis. As a politician, he also <strong>advocated for civil rights</strong> and was known for his <strong>fight against organised crime</strong>.</p><p>The two Kennedy brothers were known for their close relationship, which is partly credited with helping to bring a peaceful resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>Although initially he was one of the advisers who argued for a more forceful response to the Soviet Union, Robert Kennedy was <strong>involved in the development of the Cuba blockade strategy</strong>, which averted a full-blown military confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union.</p><p>Robert Kennedy also served as <strong>an important link to Khrushchev</strong>, by holding secret meetings with members of the Soviet Government. He would later serve as <strong>the President&rsquo;s personal representative in Operation Mongoose</strong>, a post-Bay of Pigs operation meant to weaken Cuba&rsquo;s economy and overthrow Castro.</p><p>In 1968, Robert Kennedy was the main Democratic nominee for US Presidency but was <strong>assassinated</strong> during his presidential campaign.</p><h2 data-guid="6d91519e-db44-437c-ad1a-956eab4e3d61" id="heading-3">Nikita Khrushchev (1894-1971)</h2><p>Nikita Khrushchev led the Soviet Union as <strong>First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</strong>, and later also as <strong>Premier</strong>, from 1953 to 1964.</p><p>After Stalin&rsquo;s death, Khrushchev&rsquo;s came to power, denouncing Stalin&rsquo;s tyrannical practices and promising a more moderate approach to state affairs. Khrushchev was <strong>a supporter of agricultural reforms, of the Soviet space program, and of military progress</strong>. He wanted the national defence to rely on missiles rather than on conventional military troops and equipment. Publicly, he boasted about the Soviet Union&rsquo;s missile programs to strengthen the Soviet Union&rsquo;s reputation.</p><p>Khrushchev&rsquo;s <strong>willingness to compromise with the US during the Cuban Missile Crisis</strong> was not well received in the Soviet Union. This, alongside his failed policies, led to him being <strong>peacefully removed from power in 1964</strong>. Before being removed, however, he was able to <strong>negotiate a test ban treaty with the US and the UK</strong> in 1963, which limited the testing of nuclear weapons to underground detonations.</p><h2 data-guid="36b0db64-35c6-405e-88b8-3df42d331987" id="heading-4">Fidel Castro (1926-2016)</h2><p>A former lawyer and activist, Fidel Castro led a revolutionary movement which would eventually place him as <strong>Cuba&rsquo;s ruler for nearly five decades</strong>. He ruled over Cuba from 1959, first as Prime Minister and then as President, until 2008, when he handed over power to his younger brother Raúl.</p><p><strong>Under Castro&rsquo;s regime, Cuba became a socialist state</strong> &ndash; private property, industry, and business were seized by the state, and reforms were implemented throughout the country. Although Cuba&rsquo;s education and healthcare system improved under Castro rule, Castro was also criticised for closely controlling Cuba&rsquo;s citizens and fiercely putting down any opposition.</p><p>From the beginning of his regime, Castro <strong>had a difficult relationship with the US</strong>. He believed that Cuba should control its natural resources and rejected any US involvement in the Cuban business and industry. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro made several demands, including that the US would stop its embargo on Cuba and end all attacks on him and his regime. However, his demands were largely ignored. &nbsp;</p><p>After the missile crisis, Castro <strong>got involved in revolutionary movements across the world</strong>, sending military and financial aid to several guerrilla movements in Africa and Latin America. For example, he supported Algeria&rsquo;s struggle for liberation from France&nbsp;and led successful campaigns in Angola against Angolan rebels (who had US&nbsp;support). In Latin America, for example, he offered shelter and training for guerrilla groups in Brazil and Argentina. &nbsp;</p><p>Fidel Castro continued his efforts for welfare and against imperialism&nbsp;even when this went against Soviet wishes, and he was repeatedly able to resist&nbsp;the US' attempts to remove him from power. Fidel Castro <strong>died at the age of 90 in 2016</strong>.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../the-main-events-of-the-crisis.html" title="The main events of The Cuban Missile Crisis" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The main events of the crisis</span></a><a href="../aftermath-of-the-crisis.html" title="Aftermath of The Cuban Missile Crisis" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Aftermath of the crisis</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

However, he knew that a forceful response could also cause the Soviets to retaliate, most likely by using nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, on which Kennedy consulted only a small number of people, led Kennedy to \u003cstrong\u003econsult more widely\u003c/strong\u003e during the Cuban Missile Crisis by creating the ExCom committee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe invasion\u0026rsquo;s failure also strengthened his resolve to remove Cuban leader Fidel Castro from power. The Administration subsequently launched \u003cstrong\u003eOperation Mongoose\u003c/strong\u003e, a secret plan in which the possibility of assassinating Castro was also taken into consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKennedy took office with the \u003cstrong\u003eintention to eradicate poverty in the US and support its space explorations\u003c/strong\u003e.

As a politician, he also \u003cstrong\u003eadvocated for civil rights\u003c/strong\u003e and was known for his \u003cstrong\u003efight against organised crime\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two Kennedy brothers were known for their close relationship, which is partly credited with helping to bring a peaceful resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough initially he was one of the advisers who argued for a more forceful response to the Soviet Union, Robert Kennedy was \u003cstrong\u003einvolved in the development of the Cuba blockade strategy\u003c/strong\u003e, which averted a full-blown military confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRobert Kennedy also served as \u003cstrong\u003ean important link to Khrushchev\u003c/strong\u003e, by holding secret meetings with members of the Soviet Government. He would later serve as \u003cstrong\u003ethe President\u0026rsquo;s personal representative in Operation Mongoose\u003c/strong\u003e, a post-Bay of Pigs operation meant to weaken Cuba\u0026rsquo;s economy and overthrow Castro.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1968, Robert Kennedy was the main Democratic nominee for US Presidency but was \u003cstrong\u003eassassinated\u003c/strong\u003e during his presidential campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00226d91519e-db44-437c-ad1a-956eab4e3d61\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003eNikita Khrushchev (1894-1971)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNikita Khrushchev led the Soviet Union as \u003cstrong\u003eFirst Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\u003c/strong\u003e, and later also as \u003cstrong\u003ePremier\u003c/strong\u003e, from 1953 to 1964.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Stalin\u0026rsquo;s death, Khrushchev\u0026rsquo;s came to power, denouncing Stalin\u0026rsquo;s tyrannical practices and promising a more moderate approach to state affairs. Khrushchev was \u003cstrong\u003ea supporter of agricultural reforms, of the Soviet space program, and of military progress\u003c/strong\u003e. He wanted the national defence to rely on missiles rather than on conventional military troops and equipment.

This, alongside his failed policies, led to him being \u003cstrong\u003epeacefully removed from power in 1964\u003c/strong\u003e. Before being removed, however, he was able to \u003cstrong\u003enegotiate a test ban treaty with the US and the UK\u003c/strong\u003e in 1963, which limited the testing of nuclear weapons to underground detonations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002236b0db64-35c6-405e-88b8-3df42d331987\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eFidel Castro (1926-2016)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA former lawyer and activist, Fidel Castro led a revolutionary movement which would eventually place him as \u003cstrong\u003eCuba\u0026rsquo;s ruler for nearly five decades\u003c/strong\u003e. He ruled over Cuba from 1959, first as Prime Minister and then as President, until 2008, when he handed over power to his younger brother Raúl.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnder Castro\u0026rsquo;s regime, Cuba became a socialist state\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; private property, industry, and business were seized by the state, and reforms were implemented throughout the country. Although Cuba\u0026rsquo;s education and healthcare system improved under Castro rule, Castro was also criticised for closely controlling Cuba\u0026rsquo;s citizens and fiercely putting down any opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning of his regime, Castro \u003cstrong\u003ehad a difficult relationship with the US\u003c/strong\u003e. He believed that Cuba should control its natural resources and rejected any US involvement in the Cuban business and industry. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro made several demands, including that the US would stop its embargo on Cuba and end all attacks on him and his regime.
