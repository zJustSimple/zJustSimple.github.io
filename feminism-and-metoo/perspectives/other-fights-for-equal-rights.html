Throughout history, <strong>the movements intersected in various ways</strong>. For example, at the beginning of the women&rsquo;s suffragist movement, suffragists also advocated for African-American men&nbsp;and women's&nbsp;right to vote. This was because some of the suffragists were former abolitionists. However, some of the suffragists did not believe in racial equality, and others distanced themselves from the cause&nbsp;to keep or gain the support of those communities or politicians who did not support equal rights for African Americans.</p><p><strong>After women&rsquo;s suffrage was granted, feminism became more inclusive</strong> and feminists started to support the movements&nbsp;for the rights of African Americans and LGBTQ people. Some members of these movements also defined themselves as feminists and fought for women&rsquo;s equal rights.</p><p><strong>However, the movements were not always compatible</strong>. For example, some historians have pointed out the sexism in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Although many African-American women stood out as important figures in the movement, the civil rights community was mostly led by men who often did not subscribe to the idea of gender equality.</p><p>In a similar manner, prominent feminist figures such as Germaine Greer or Sheila Jeffreys have made controversial comments about transgender topics, basically sending the message that transgender politics are not compatible with their idea of feminism.</p><p>However, as the concept of <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;Intersectional feminism observes the ways in which women experience discrimination not only as a result of their gender, but also as a result of belonging to one or more minorities.&lt;/p&gt;">intersectionality</span> spread into the broader culture, feminism and the fight for minority rights&nbsp;began to intersect more and more.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="562df1e6-9e8f-4bc9-9f5d-903519a5de49">The civil rights movement</h2><p><strong>Starting in the mid-50s</strong>, the <strong><a target="" href="../../the-civil-rights-movement.html">civil rights movement</a></strong> was a mass protest movement which fought to obtain legal and civil rights for African Americans, calling for an end to racial segregation and discrimination.</p><p>The movement included numerous important events, starting in 1955 with Rosa Parks&rsquo; arrest. Parks, an African-American woman, refused to give her bus seat to a white passenger. The arrest sparked <strong>the Montgomery Bus Boycott</strong>, during which African Americans refused to ride city buses in Montgomery, Alabama. The Supreme Court consequently decided that bus segregation was&nbsp;unconstitutional, and the city of Montgomery banned&nbsp;segregation in buses.</p><p>Between 1958 and 1963, there were numerous non-violent protests across the US. African Americans organised sit-ins (sitting in places where they were banned, such as lunch counters, libraries, museums, etc.), and &ldquo;freedom rides&rdquo;, where racially mixed groups would ride together on interstate buses, in an effort to highlight that the ban on segregated buses was not implemented.</p><p><strong>The March on Washington in 1963</strong> called for social and political equality: the right to vote, integrated education, proper housing, equal employment opportunities and many other improvements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In 1964, the Civil Rights Act was passed</strong>, ending segregation and banning employment discrimination based on several criteria, including race. However, local authorities still tried to stop African Americans from voter registration, which resulted in the organisation of <strong>the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965</strong>, that saw violent encounters between marchers and state troopers.</p><p>I<strong>n 1965, the Voting Rights Act is passed</strong>, outlawing racial discrimination in voting.&nbsp;The Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act&nbsp;are considered the main achievements of the civil rights movement.</p><p>Several riots also took place from 1964 to 1968, with violent acts spreading nationwide after Martin Luther King&rsquo;s assassination in April 1968. These riots led to <strong>the Civil Rights Act of 1968</strong>, which ensures equal housing opportunities to all Americans.</p><p>However, discrimination is still an issue in America&rsquo;s society today. Since 2012, the issue of discrimination against African-American people was brought to national attention after incidents in which unarmed African-American men were killed. The incidents gave rise to <strong>the Black Lives Matter movement</strong>, which aims to raise awareness about racial discrimination and police brutality against African-American people.</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="d30798f5-46e5-4ce8-957c-e64ca1999978">The movement for LGBTQ rights</h2><p>The movement for LGBTQ rights <strong>began in the US in the 1950s</strong>, at a time when homosexuality was illegal in all states. Transgender visibility and the fight for equality started around the same time, as Christine Jorgensen became the first transgender person to become widely known in the US for her gender reassignment surgery. Jorgensen&rsquo;s fame allowed her to bring visibility to the transgender community for the first time.</p><p><strong>In 1962, homosexuality was decriminalised in Illinois</strong>. In 1964, Reed Erickson, a transgender man, created&nbsp;the Erickson Educational Foundation, supporting gay and transgender equality by donating millions of dollars to the cause.</p><p>In 1969, <strong>the Stonewall riots</strong> in New York City&nbsp;(a series of demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ communities)&nbsp;brought the gay rights movement into public attention. Transgender women Marcia P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, among others, are credited for their bravery in standing up to police in the riots.</p><p>The riots were also likely influenced by the activist atmosphere created by other movements such as the anti-Vietnam War movement and the civil rights movement.</p><p>In 1972, <strong>Sweden</strong> became the first country in the world to allow its citizens to legally change their gender.</p><p>Gay rights gained more visibility in the 1970s through the involvement of <strong>Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California</strong>&nbsp;and through <strong>the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights (1979)</strong>. The march is also supposedly inspired by the historical marches of 1963 and 1965 during the civil rights movement.</p><p>By 1993, other states had decriminalised homosexuality and&nbsp;passed laws which banned discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, in some states, laws banning homosexuality were still in effect, while other policies made discrimination possible in other areas. Moreover, hate crimes that targeted LGBTQ people were frequent.</p><p>Consequently, the LGBTQ community organised <strong>a March on Washington in 1993</strong> during which a series of demands was made, including the demand for legal same-sex partnerships.</p><p>A series of gender-identity-related murders (among the most known are the murders of Brandon Teena and Rita Hester) during the 1990s sparked national outrage and draw attention to the mistreatment of transgender people. The crimes also inspired the creation of <strong>the international Transgender Day of Remembrance</strong>, meant to honour the victims of anti-transgender violence.</p><p>In the years that followed, US states began to grant same-sex couples the right to form civil unions and, <strong>in 2015, the US Supreme Court granted the right to marry to same-sex couples nationwide</strong>. Moreover, by 2018, 14 US States, the District of Columbia, as well as some local counties have banned conversion therapy (an intervention meant to change&nbsp;an individual&rsquo;s sexual orientation, usually organised by religious groups) for minors.</p><p>In the 2000s, several organisations that advocate&nbsp;transgender equality were founded. The transgender community gains new visibility through celebrities such as Candis Cayne and Laverne Cox.</p><p>Today, the LGBTQ community still<strong> faces numerous challenges around the world</strong> &ndash; harassment and abuse in schools, employment and health care discrimination, hate crimes, etc.</p><p>In the US, the conservative administration of President Donald Trump has often been criticised for being anti-LGBTQ, as it has already revoked some legal protections for transgender students and workers&nbsp;and proposed other discriminatory measures, such as the reinstatement of a ban on transgender people serving in the military.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../perspectives.html" title="Putting feminism and #MeToo Perspectives" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Perspectives</span></a><a href="../texts.html" title="Texts about feminism and #MeToo" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Texts about feminism and #MeToo</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Throughout history, \u003cstrong\u003ethe movements intersected in various ways\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, at the beginning of the women\u0026rsquo;s suffragist movement, suffragists also advocated for African-American men\u0026nbsp;and women\u0027s\u0026nbsp;right to vote. This was because some of the suffragists were former abolitionists. However, some of the suffragists did not believe in racial equality, and others distanced themselves from the cause\u0026nbsp;to keep or gain the support of those communities or politicians who did not support equal rights for African Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfter women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage was granted, feminism became more inclusive\u003c/strong\u003e and feminists started to support the movements\u0026nbsp;for the rights of African Americans and LGBTQ people. Some members of these movements also defined themselves as feminists and fought for women\u0026rsquo;s equal rights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, the movements were not always compatible\u003c/strong\u003e. For example, some historians have pointed out the sexism in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Although many African-American women stood out as important figures in the movement, the civil rights community was mostly led by men who often did not subscribe to the idea of gender equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a similar manner, prominent feminist figures such as Germaine Greer or Sheila Jeffreys have made controversial comments about transgender topics, basically sending the message that transgender politics are not compatible with their idea of feminism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, as the concept of \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Intersectional feminism observes the ways in which women experience discrimination not only as a result of their gender, but also as a result of belonging to one or more minorities.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0022\u003eintersectionality\u003c/span\u003e spread into the broader culture, feminism and the fight for minority rights\u0026nbsp;began to intersect more and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022562df1e6-9e8f-4bc9-9f5d-903519a5de49\u0022\u003eThe civil rights movement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarting in the mid-50s\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/the-civil-rights-movement\u0022\u003ecivil rights movement\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e was a mass protest movement which fought to obtain legal and civil rights for African Americans, calling for an end to racial segregation and discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe movement included numerous important events, starting in 1955 with Rosa Parks\u0026rsquo; arrest. Parks, an African-American woman, refused to give her bus seat to a white passenger. The arrest sparked \u003cstrong\u003ethe Montgomery Bus Boycott\u003c/strong\u003e, during which African Americans refused to ride city buses in Montgomery, Alabama. The Supreme Court consequently decided that bus segregation was\u0026nbsp;unconstitutional, and the city of Montgomery banned\u0026nbsp;segregation in buses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBetween 1958 and 1963, there were numerous non-violent protests across the US. African Americans organised sit-ins (sitting in places where they were banned, such as lunch counters, libraries, museums, etc.), and \u0026ldquo;freedom rides\u0026rdquo;, where racially mixed groups would ride together on interstate buses, in an effort to highlight that the ban on segregated buses was not implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe March on Washington in 1963\u003c/strong\u003e called for social and political equality: the right to vote, integrated education, proper housing, equal employment opportunities and many other improvements.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 1964, the Civil Rights Act was passed\u003c/strong\u003e, ending segregation and banning employment discrimination based on several criteria, including race. However, local authorities still tried to stop African Americans from voter registration, which resulted in the organisation of \u003cstrong\u003ethe Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965\u003c/strong\u003e, that saw violent encounters between marchers and state troopers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u003cstrong\u003en 1965, the Voting Rights Act is passed\u003c/strong\u003e, outlawing racial discrimination in voting.\u0026nbsp;The Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act\u0026nbsp;are considered the main achievements of the civil rights movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral riots also took place from 1964 to 1968, with violent acts spreading nationwide after Martin Luther King\u0026rsquo;s assassination in April 1968. These riots led to \u003cstrong\u003ethe Civil Rights Act of 1968\u003c/strong\u003e, which ensures equal housing opportunities to all Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, discrimination is still an issue in America\u0026rsquo;s society today. Since 2012, the issue of discrimination against African-American people was brought to national attention after incidents in which unarmed African-American men were killed. The incidents gave rise to \u003cstrong\u003ethe Black Lives Matter movement\u003c/strong\u003e, which aims to raise awareness about racial discrimination and police brutality against African-American people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d30798f5-46e5-4ce8-957c-e64ca1999978\u0022\u003eThe movement for LGBTQ rights\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe movement for LGBTQ rights \u003cstrong\u003ebegan in the US in the 1950s\u003c/strong\u003e, at a time when homosexuality was illegal in all states. Transgender visibility and the fight for equality started around the same time, as Christine Jorgensen became the first transgender person to become widely known in the US for her gender reassignment surgery. Jorgensen\u0026rsquo;s fame allowed her to bring visibility to the transgender community for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 1962, homosexuality was decriminalised in Illinois\u003c/strong\u003e. In 1964, Reed Erickson, a transgender man, created\u0026nbsp;the Erickson Educational Foundation, supporting gay and transgender equality by donating millions of dollars to the cause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1969, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Stonewall riots\u003c/strong\u003e in New York City\u0026nbsp;(a series of demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ communities)\u0026nbsp;brought the gay rights movement into public attention.

Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, among others, are credited for their bravery in standing up to police in the riots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe riots were also likely influenced by the activist atmosphere created by other movements such as the anti-Vietnam War movement and the civil rights movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1972, \u003cstrong\u003eSweden\u003c/strong\u003e became the first country in the world to allow its citizens to legally change their gender.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGay rights gained more visibility in the 1970s through the involvement of \u003cstrong\u003eHarvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;and through \u003cstrong\u003ethe National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights (1979)\u003c/strong\u003e. The march is also supposedly inspired by the historical marches of 1963 and 1965 during the civil rights movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 1993, other states had decriminalised homosexuality and\u0026nbsp;passed laws which banned discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, in some states, laws banning homosexuality were still in effect, while other policies made discrimination possible in other areas. Moreover, hate crimes that targeted LGBTQ people were frequent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsequently, the LGBTQ community organised \u003cstrong\u003ea March on Washington in 1993\u003c/strong\u003e during which a series of demands was made, including the demand for legal same-sex partnerships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA series of gender-identity-related murders (among the most known are the murders of Brandon Teena and Rita Hester) during the 1990s sparked national outrage and draw attention to the mistreatment of transgender people. The crimes also inspired the creation of \u003cstrong\u003ethe international Transgender Day of Remembrance\u003c/strong\u003e, meant to honour the victims of anti-transgender violence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the years that followed, US states began to grant same-sex couples the right to form civil unions and, \u003cstrong\u003ein 2015, the US Supreme Court granted the right to marry to same-sex couples nationwide\u003c/strong\u003e. Moreover, by 2018, 14 US States, the District of Columbia, as well as some local counties have banned conversion therapy (an intervention meant to change\u0026nbsp;an individual\u0026rsquo;s sexual orientation, usually organised by religious groups) for minors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 2000s, several organisations that advocate\u0026nbsp;transgender equality were founded. The transgender community gains new visibility through celebrities such as Candis Cayne and Laverne Cox.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, the LGBTQ community still\u003cstrong\u003e faces numerous challenges around the world\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; harassment and abuse in schools, employment and health care discrimination, hate crimes, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the US, the conservative administration of President Donald Trump has often been criticised for being anti-LGBTQ, as it has already revoked some legal protections for transgender students and workers\u0026nbsp;and proposed other discriminatory measures, such as the reinstatement of a ban on transgender people serving in the military.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Other fights for equal rights","MetaDescription":"Other fights for equal rights happened in parallel with the movement for women’s rights.
