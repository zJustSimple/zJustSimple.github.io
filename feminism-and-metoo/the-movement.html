The articles, and other accusations which followed them, exposed Weinstein&rsquo;s systematic abuse of women in the entertainment industry, which allegedly took place for decades.</p><p>On 16<sup>th</sup> of October, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women on Twitter to use <strong>the hashtag #MeToo</strong> if they had also&nbsp;been sexually harassed or assaulted. The term was inspired by activist Tarana Burke, who used the phrase &ldquo;Me Too&rdquo; for the first time in 2006, in a campaign meant to reach underprivileged girls who had experienced sexual abuse. Burke recalled in a <em>New York Times</em> article that the phrase came to her in 1997, after hearing a 13-year-old&rsquo;s sexual abuse story at a youth camp, and feeling unable to share her own story at&nbsp;that&nbsp;moment.</p><p>The #MeToo hashtag became viral and turned into an international phenomenon, with women from other countries either adopting the term directly or translating it into their own language. #MeToo became #Ana_kaman in Arab countries, #YoTambien in Spanish speaking countries, #BalanceTonPorc (&ldquo;expose your pig&rdquo;) in France, etc. Women around the world shared their own experiences of rape, assault, and harassment. Not just in the workplace, but also in other social situations or&nbsp;in close relationships. Sometimes, they simply shared the hashtag by itself, as a simple but powerful attestation of how common sexual assault is.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="9f3865ca-a342-4fb7-836d-367a1b5042c0">Aftermath of the Weinstein accusations</h2><p>After being accused of sexually harassing and abusing women in the entertainment industry, <strong>Harvey Weinstein issued a statement meant to provide a public apology to his victims</strong>.</p><p>However, the statement was heavily criticised, as many thought the statement sought to justify Weinstein&rsquo;s behaviour rather than make amends for it. This was because Weinstein attributed his behaviour to growing up in the 1960s, when rules about workplace behaviour were different. His statement implied that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong; moreover, he claimed that the encounters with his alleged victims were consensual. On 8<sup>th</sup> of October 2017, three days after the scandal broke out, Weinstein was&nbsp;fired by&nbsp;the Weinstein Company.</p><p>Since the story about Weinstein first broke, <strong>more than 80 women, including famous actresses such as Salma Hayek and Gwyneth Paltrow, have come forward with accounts of rape, abuse, and sexual misconduct involving the producer</strong>. One year later, Weinstein faces criminal trial for multiple sex crime charges in New York, in incidents involving several women.</p><p>As the #MeToo movement started to become widespread, a series of other public figures&nbsp;(many of them men in positions of power), were accused of sexual misconduct. This has been called <strong>&ldquo;the Weinstein effect&rdquo;</strong>.</p><p>On the 18<sup>th</sup> of October 2017, gymnast McKayla Maroney accused US gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of sexual assault, and more than 150 other women and girls came forward in the following period with stories of sexual abuse involving Nassar - with most of the victims being&nbsp;underage girls at the time of the abuse. Nasser eventually received a combined prison sentence of more than 100 years for sexual abuse of children&nbsp;and possession of child pornography.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused actor Kevin Spacey of making sexual advances towards him when Rapp was underage. In response, Spacey came&nbsp;out as gay, but claimed&nbsp;he did&nbsp;not remember the incident (a statement which, like Weinstein&rsquo;s, has been heavily criticised). Spacey has subsequently been excluded from the TV show <em>House of Cards</em>,&nbsp;and he was also replaced in a movie in which he was intended to portray the main character.</p><p>The list continues to grow throughout 2017 and 2018; according to <a target="" href="https://www.vox.com/a/sexual-harassment-assault-allegations-list">an infographic by Vox</a>,&nbsp;over 200 CEOs, politicians, and celebrities have been accused of sexual misconduct. The impact on those accused varied &ndash; some of them were fired, some resigned, while some managed to deny&nbsp;the allegations and keep their careers.</p><p>A controversial case in 2018 was that of <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong>, Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court. In the weeks before Kavanaugh was to be confirmed by the Senate, several women came forward and accused him of sexual assault. The FBI were brought in for a quick&nbsp;investigation, but in the end&nbsp;Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed&nbsp;and put into one of the most influential positions in the US, despite the allegations against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="ef23c9c9-2f65-4610-bc56-eeaedd0b91c5">Achievements of the #MeToo movement</h2><p>The #MeToo movement achieved <strong>visibility for women&rsquo;s almost universal exposure to sexual violence</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>helped uncover a culture in which sexual violence against women is still accepted</strong>. This is especially true for Hollywood, as many pointed out that rumours about Weinstein and others like him circulated for years, but were largely ignored because these men held positions of power in the entertainment business. By exposing these men, the movement also contributed to some of them being brought to justice.</p><p><strong>Sexual violence, harassment, and consent became important topics of debate across Europe as well</strong>. Some European politicians also faced allegations of sexual misconduct, and many of them resigned or were fired. Sweden proposed new legislation to change its rape law so that people would have to get explicit consent before sexual contact.</p><p>Furthermore, Swedish press revealed in November 2017 that Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of one of the members of the Swedish Academy - responsible for choosing the Nobel Laureates in Literature - was accused of serial sexual assault. Arnault and his wife Katarina Frostenson were also accused of misusing academy funding and leaking the names of literature prize winners for years. Due to the scandal, no Nobel Prize for literature was awarded in 2018.</p><p><strong>#MeToo also reached countries such as Indonesia, India, China, and Japan</strong>, where sexual harassment and abuse are generally&nbsp;taboo because of a historically patriarchal social structure&nbsp;and are, therefore, given little attention.</p><p>The movement also <strong>brought to light how men are affected by these issues</strong>, with several American male actors coming forward with their own stories of how they became victims of sexual harassment. Other men responded with the hashtag <strong>#HowIWillChange</strong>, proposing different ways in which men could change their attitude and behaviour in relation to women.</p><p>The initiative <strong>Time&rsquo;s Up</strong>, founded at the beginning of 2018 by 300 women working in theatre, film, and television&nbsp;set up a fund for the financial support of victims of sexual assault and harassment who seek legal help. The #MeToo and Time&rsquo;s Up movements also made an appearance at awards ceremonies in 2018, such as the Golden Globes and the Oscars, with actors and actresses supporting the movements by wearing black clothing, &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s Up&rdquo; pins, and praising the women who came forward with their stories.</p><p>With the help of the Time&rsquo;s Up movement, <strong>anti-sexual harassment guidelines</strong> were created and adopted by the Producers&rsquo; Guild of America, with similar guidelines being drafted in Europe. The movement also <strong>brought attention to other issues such as sexism, unequal pay, or lack of inclusivity in the entertainment business</strong>.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="6b5da414-c4e2-4bc3-8887-03c7dfb7e19e">Criticism of the #MeToo movement</h2><p>The #MeToo movement has been criticised from various points of view. As the movement grew larger, some noted <strong>the potential dangers of men being put on &ldquo;trial by media&rdquo;</strong>. This referred to men being accused and suffering social repercussions without a proper chance to defend themselves. Some critics questioned the truth behind some of the sexual misconduct allegations, fearing that some women might take advantage of the movement to damage men&rsquo;s reputations (<a target="" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684">note that most studies show that false allegations of sexual misconduct&nbsp;are very uncommon</a>, suggesting that this is not a widespread issue).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrities and prominent public figures have also spoken against the #MeToo movement. For example, a letter signed by actress Catherine Deneuve and 99 other French women was published in <em>Le Monde, </em>arguing that the movement was <strong>fuelled by a hatred of men</strong>. The backlash against the letter was severe, however, leading Deneuve to apologise to sexual assault victims. Germaine Greer, a well-known feminist figure, have also criticised the movement for <strong>encouraging victimisation</strong>.</p><p>Margaret Atwood, a well-known author and feminist icon for many, was also criticised for her comments on the movement. Atwood <strong>questioned the #MeToo movement&rsquo;s impact on ending sexual harassment</strong>&nbsp;and warned against it <strong>becoming an extreme ideology</strong>. While some praised Atwood's criticism, many accused her of failing to support women. The backlash was also linked to Atwood&rsquo;s controversial support for Steven Galloway, a former professor at the University of British Columbia, who had been accused of sexual assault and harassment in 2016.</p><p>The US President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has openly criticised the #MeToo movement on many occasions, implying that many of the allegations being presented are false, and claiming that "it's a very scary time for young men in America", but that "women are doing great"&nbsp;(<a target="" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/02/politics/trump-scary-time-for-young-men-metoo/index.html">source</a>).

Burke recalled in a \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e article that the phrase came to her in 1997, after hearing a 13-year-old\u0026rsquo;s sexual abuse story at a youth camp, and feeling unable to share her own story at\u0026nbsp;that\u0026nbsp;moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe #MeToo hashtag became viral and turned into an international phenomenon, with women from other countries either adopting the term directly or translating it into their own language. #MeToo became #Ana_kaman in Arab countries, #YoTambien in Spanish speaking countries, #BalanceTonPorc (\u0026ldquo;expose your pig\u0026rdquo;) in France, etc. Women around the world shared their own experiences of rape, assault, and harassment. Not just in the workplace, but also in other social situations or\u0026nbsp;in close relationships. Sometimes, they simply shared the hashtag by itself, as a simple but powerful attestation of how common sexual assault is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00229f3865ca-a342-4fb7-836d-367a1b5042c0\u0022\u003eAftermath of the Weinstein accusations\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter being accused of sexually harassing and abusing women in the entertainment industry, \u003cstrong\u003eHarvey Weinstein issued a statement meant to provide a public apology to his victims\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the statement was heavily criticised, as many thought the statement sought to justify Weinstein\u0026rsquo;s behaviour rather than make amends for it. This was because Weinstein attributed his behaviour to growing up in the 1960s, when rules about workplace behaviour were different. His statement implied that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong; moreover, he claimed that the encounters with his alleged victims were consensual. On 8\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of October 2017, three days after the scandal broke out, Weinstein was\u0026nbsp;fired by\u0026nbsp;the Weinstein Company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the story about Weinstein first broke, \u003cstrong\u003emore than 80 women, including famous actresses such as Salma Hayek and Gwyneth Paltrow, have come forward with accounts of rape, abuse, and sexual misconduct involving the producer\u003c/strong\u003e. One year later, Weinstein faces criminal trial for multiple sex crime charges in New York, in incidents involving several women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the #MeToo movement started to become widespread, a series of other public figures\u0026nbsp;(many of them men in positions of power), were accused of sexual misconduct. This has been called \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;the Weinstein effect\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the 18\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of October 2017, gymnast McKayla Maroney accused US gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of sexual assault, and more than 150 other women and girls came forward in the following period with stories of sexual abuse involving Nassar - with most of the victims being\u0026nbsp;underage girls at the time of the abuse. Nasser eventually received a combined prison sentence of more than 100 years for sexual abuse of children\u0026nbsp;and possession of child pornography.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused actor Kevin Spacey of making sexual advances towards him when Rapp was underage. In response, Spacey came\u0026nbsp;out as gay, but claimed\u0026nbsp;he did\u0026nbsp;not remember the incident (a statement which, like Weinstein\u0026rsquo;s, has been heavily criticised). Spacey has subsequently been excluded from the TV show \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e,\u0026nbsp;and he was also replaced in a movie in which he was intended to portray the main character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe list continues to grow throughout 2017 and 2018; according to \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.vox.com/a/sexual-harassment-assault-allegations-list\u0022\u003ean infographic by Vox\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026nbsp;over 200 CEOs, politicians, and celebrities have been accused of sexual misconduct. The impact on those accused varied \u0026ndash; some of them were fired, some resigned, while some managed to deny\u0026nbsp;the allegations and keep their careers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA controversial case in 2018 was that of \u003cstrong\u003eBrett Kavanaugh\u003c/strong\u003e, Donald Trump\u0027s nominee for the Supreme Court. In the weeks before Kavanaugh was to be confirmed by the Senate, several women came forward and accused him of sexual assault. The FBI were brought in for a quick\u0026nbsp;investigation, but in the end\u0026nbsp;Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed\u0026nbsp;and put into one of the most influential positions in the US, despite the allegations against him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022ef23c9c9-2f65-4610-bc56-eeaedd0b91c5\u0022\u003eAchievements of the #MeToo movement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe #MeToo movement achieved \u003cstrong\u003evisibility for women\u0026rsquo;s almost universal exposure to sexual violence\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;and \u003cstrong\u003ehelped uncover a culture in which sexual violence against women is still accepted\u003c/strong\u003e. This is especially true for Hollywood, as many pointed out that rumours about Weinstein and others like him circulated for years, but were largely ignored because these men held positions of power in the entertainment business. By exposing these men, the movement also contributed to some of them being brought to justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSexual violence, harassment, and consent became important topics of debate across Europe as well\u003c/strong\u003e. Some European politicians also faced allegations of sexual misconduct, and many of them resigned or were fired. Sweden proposed new legislation to change its rape law so that people would have to get explicit consent before sexual contact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Swedish press revealed in November 2017 that Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of one of the members of the Swedish Academy - responsible for choosing the Nobel Laureates in Literature - was accused of serial sexual assault. Arnault and his wife Katarina Frostenson were also accused of misusing academy funding and leaking the names of literature prize winners for years. Due to the scandal, no Nobel Prize for literature was awarded in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#MeToo also reached countries such as Indonesia, India, China, and Japan\u003c/strong\u003e, where sexual harassment and abuse are generally\u0026nbsp;taboo because of a historically patriarchal social structure\u0026nbsp;and are, therefore, given little attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe movement also \u003cstrong\u003ebrought to light how men are affected by these issues\u003c/strong\u003e, with several American male actors coming forward with their own stories of how they became victims of sexual harassment. Other men responded with the hashtag \u003cstrong\u003e#HowIWillChange\u003c/strong\u003e, proposing different ways in which men could change their attitude and behaviour in relation to women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe initiative \u003cstrong\u003eTime\u0026rsquo;s Up\u003c/strong\u003e, founded at the beginning of 2018 by 300 women working in theatre, film, and television\u0026nbsp;set up a fund for the financial support of victims of sexual assault and harassment who seek legal help. The #MeToo and Time\u0026rsquo;s Up movements also made an appearance at awards ceremonies in 2018, such as the Golden Globes and the Oscars, with actors and actresses supporting the movements by wearing black clothing, \u0026ldquo;Time\u0026rsquo;s Up\u0026rdquo; pins, and praising the women who came forward with their stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the help of the Time\u0026rsquo;s Up movement, \u003cstrong\u003eanti-sexual harassment guidelines\u003c/strong\u003e were created and adopted by the Producers\u0026rsquo; Guild of America, with similar guidelines being drafted in Europe. The movement also \u003cstrong\u003ebrought attention to other issues such as sexism, unequal pay, or lack of inclusivity in the entertainment business\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u00226b5da414-c4e2-4bc3-8887-03c7dfb7e19e\u0022\u003eCriticism of the #MeToo movement\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe #MeToo movement has been criticised from various points of view. As the movement grew larger, some noted \u003cstrong\u003ethe potential dangers of men being put on \u0026ldquo;trial by media\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e. This referred to men being accused and suffering social repercussions without a proper chance to defend themselves. Some critics questioned the truth behind some of the sexual misconduct allegations, fearing that some women might take advantage of the movement to damage men\u0026rsquo;s reputations (\u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684\u0022\u003enote that most studies show that false allegations of sexual misconduct\u0026nbsp;are very uncommon\u003c/a\u003e, suggesting that this is not a widespread issue).\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCelebrities and prominent public figures have also spoken against the #MeToo movement. For example, a letter signed by actress Catherine Deneuve and 99 other French women was published in \u003cem\u003eLe Monde, \u003c/em\u003earguing that the movement was \u003cstrong\u003efuelled by a hatred of men\u003c/strong\u003e. The backlash against the letter was severe, however, leading Deneuve to apologise to sexual assault victims. Germaine Greer, a well-known feminist figure, have also criticised the movement for \u003cstrong\u003eencouraging victimisation\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMargaret Atwood, a well-known author and feminist icon for many, was also criticised for her comments on the movement. Atwood \u003cstrong\u003equestioned the #MeToo movement\u0026rsquo;s impact on ending sexual harassment\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;and warned against it \u003cstrong\u003ebecoming an extreme ideology\u003c/strong\u003e. While some praised Atwood\u0027s criticism, many accused her of failing to support women. The backlash was also linked to Atwood\u0026rsquo;s controversial support for Steven Galloway, a former professor at the University of British Columbia, who had been accused of sexual assault and harassment in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe US President \u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump\u003c/strong\u003e has openly criticised the #MeToo movement on many occasions, implying that many of the allegations being presented are false, and claiming that \u0022it\u0027s a very scary time for young men in America\u0022, but that \u0022women are doing great\u0022\u0026nbsp;(\u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/02/politics/trump-scary-time-for-young-men-metoo/index.html\u0022\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e).
