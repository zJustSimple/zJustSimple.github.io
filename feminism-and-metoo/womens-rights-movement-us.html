Known as the Seneca Falls Convention, the event was <strong>organised by <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;A member of a Christian movement called the Religious Society of Friends.&lt;/p&gt;">Quaker</span> women</strong> &ndash; most notably, Quaker <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;An advocate for the end of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;">abolitionist</span> Lucretia Mott - and by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, another abolitionist. Its organisation was inspired by Mott and&nbsp;Stanton being denied access to the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention because of their gender.</p><p>During the meeting, Stanton and the Quaker women <strong>proposed the Declaration of Sentiments, Grievances, and Resolutions</strong>. The document was to be modified before being put forward for signatures.</p><p>The Declaration listed several causes of complaint in regard to laws that limited or denied women&rsquo;s rights to money and property, as well as to education and professional careers. Furthermore, the Declaration stated that women should be allowed to vote in elections.</p><p><strong>Women&rsquo;s right to vote sparked a debate</strong> and even Mott advised it should be removed from the Declaration. However, Frederick Douglass, a former slave who became a leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, advocated for women's suffrage, and the concept was eventually included in the Declaration.</p><p>The Declaration was signed by 100 attendees, mostly women, out of 300 present at the Convention. The document and the Seneca Falls Convention are viewed today as revolutionary steps in the fight for women&rsquo;s equality in society. Moreover, the Declaration gained much attention for the issue of women&rsquo;s right to vote at the time.</p><p>The Seneca Falls Convention was quickly followed by other conventions, and led to the creation of <strong>a series of national women&rsquo;s rights conventions</strong> which were organised annually until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="d1b6e5e3-bdbe-499c-b1be-ec8d4557fab1">Women&rsquo;s suffrage after the Civil War</h2><p>After the American Civil War ended in 1865, two major events stimulated the rise of the women&rsquo;s rights movement, which had lost momentum with the beginning of the war.</p><p>In 1866, the American Equal Rights Association (AERA) was created by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The organisation&rsquo;s members were both white and black women and men, and their purpose was to secure equal rights to all American citizens, especially the right of suffrage. In the following year, the AERA conducted two major campaigns in New York and Kansas. In New York, AERA sought public support for women&rsquo;s suffrage and for the removal of property requirements that discriminated against African Americans, by collecting petitions. In Kansas, they campaigned for the organisation of a direct vote&nbsp;on the issue of women and African Americans&rsquo; right to vote.</p><p>However, both the New York and Kansas campaigns encountered <strong>resistance from those who thought that gaining suffrage for African-American men was a priority</strong>. This disagreement created a divide&nbsp;within the AERA&nbsp;and within the women&rsquo;s rights movement itself.</p><p>The second major event that affected the course of the women&rsquo;s rights&nbsp;movement was <strong>two controversial Amendments to the US Constitution</strong>. The 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, ratified in 1868, extended the Constitution&rsquo;s protection to all citizens, but it defined &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; as male and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;explicitly discriminated against women. The 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment, ratified in 1870, denied limiting the right to&nbsp;vote based on race, colour, or former slave status and, and was&nbsp;meant to guarantee&nbsp;suffrage for African-American men, but once again did not help women.</p><p><strong>In 1869, women&rsquo;s suffrage was granted for the first time in the US, in the state of Wyoming</strong>. The first woman to vote in a general election in the US was Louisa Ann Swain.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="32ab3eb0-c810-4ecc-9ffc-7f947afb1c30">The fight for&nbsp;women&rsquo;s suffrage in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century</h2><p>Women&rsquo;s access to higher education improved with the creation of public and private women&rsquo;s colleges, which meant that more women could be educated and gain an interest in social change. Moreover, because these women were <strong>largely excluded from the workforce even though they had higher education</strong>, many of them became involved with the women&rsquo;s rights movement to seek reform.</p><p>Women&rsquo;s suffrage encountered opposition in different forms and at different levels in society.&nbsp;<strong>On the labour market, they encountered opposition from men who were hostile</strong>&nbsp;because women were becoming competitors&nbsp;and&nbsp;because the men's&nbsp;role as family breadwinners was challenged. This working class opposition greatly affected state campaigns for women&rsquo;s suffrage, but the opposition lessened when suffragists changed their rhetoric and started to present women&rsquo;s right to vote as a way to empower and protect the working class as a whole.</p><p>At a political level, suffragists had <strong>the enormous task of</strong> <strong>gaining support from all political parties</strong>; otherwise, the topic of women&rsquo;s suffrage just became another reason for political disagreement.</p><p><strong>Anti-suffrage organisations</strong> also began to appear during the 1890s. Some groups of women who otherwise sought social reform and campaigned for women&rsquo;s rights were anti-suffragist because they believed women&rsquo;s involvement in politics would affect the image of moral superiority and purity they were seeking to present.</p><p><strong>Suffragists&rsquo; groups were often poorly funded, politically inexperienced, and too small</strong> to organise state-wide campaigns to gather signatures or convince people to participate in referendums. When referendums&nbsp;on women&rsquo;s suffrage were organised, most of them failed. However, suffragists gained new insight and experience which helped them start organisations, develop management skills, and learn to navigate the political system.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective 1 - "The Yellow Wallpaper" by Kate Chopin</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>Kate Chopin&rsquo;s short story was written in 1894, when there were several active movements for women&rsquo;s suffrage. The story's dominant theme is related to the condition of women in marriage and society. The protagonist&nbsp;could symbolise the submissive women everywhere, unable to speak for themselves&nbsp;and not&nbsp;treated as equal to&nbsp;men.</p></div></div><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective 2 - "The Story of an Hour" by Kate Chopin</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>&ldquo;The Story of an Hour&rdquo; was written in 1894, a time when women&rsquo;s suffrage had been already granted locally, in a few states, and shortly after national associations lobbying for women&rsquo;s right to vote had formed. Though there is no direct mention of women&rsquo;s suffrage in the short story, its main themes include&nbsp;freedom and independence from men.</p></div></div><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective 3 - "A Pair of Silk Stockings" by Kate Chopin</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>&ldquo;A Pair of Silk Stockings&rdquo; explores the theme of women&rsquo;s desire for self-fulfillment at the end of the nineteenth century. During that period, women&rsquo;s liberation movements were still in early phases, and traditional roles were still dominant. The story&nbsp;shows how women had very few options for self-fulfillment, as it was generally assumed they should focus on being wives and mothers.</p></div></div><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="3a3ef028-bc7d-4ab5-bdda-95c91b6ee0d9">The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)</h2><p>In the 1880s, <strong>many middle-class women</strong> who sought to expand their activities beyond&nbsp;domestic life &ndash; members of women&rsquo;s clubs, activists in progressive causes, and advocates of&nbsp;temperance, as well as participants in local charity organisations &ndash; began to support the NWSA and the AWSA. Many of these women were also advocates for social reform, as they&nbsp;had realised they had little political influence without the right to vote.</p><p>The newly gained support from women in associations such as the National Consumers League, the Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, and the Women&rsquo;s Trade Union League, as well as NWSA&rsquo;s shift in focus from the federal level to the state level <strong>convinced the NWSA and AWSA to unite and form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)</strong> in 1890. The association was led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, one of the founders of the AWSA.</p><p>Note, however, <strong>that suffrage for African-American women was not a priority for many white suffragists</strong>. Moreover, some white suffragists openly expressed their prejudice against African Americans both in their rhetoric and actions. Southern suffragists often rejected the participation of African-American women in the movement&nbsp;and maintained a strategy that aimed to enfranchise white women to outvote African Americans and preserve white dominance in the area. Anthony initially sought to keep the issue of women&rsquo;s suffrage separate from the race issue. However, because she wanted the Southern suffragists and conservative politicians on her side, she compromised and endorsed &ldquo;educated suffrage&rdquo; (meaning the voters should be literate), while refusing to help black suffragists. NAWSA eventually retreated from the Southern state campaigns, as these states not only rejected women&rsquo;s suffrage, but also passed reforms to disenfranchise African-American men.</p><p><strong>African-American women, who were not allowed membership in white women&rsquo;s organisations, formed their own associations</strong>. The Association of Colored Women<em>,</em> formed in 1896, for example, advocated for suffrage but also sought to raise awareness concerning disenfranchisement, racial segregation, and violence against African-American women.</p><p>Besides forming a new, larger organisation, <strong>the suffragists also changed their approach</strong>. Their rhetoric was initially constructed on the idea that women were equal to men&nbsp;and, therefore, deserved to enjoy the same rights as them. The suffragists now began to advocate for the women&rsquo;s right to vote because of their domestic nature, which would provide a more moral stance in politics. The shift in approach is said to be partially inspired by the temperance movement (which sought restrictions on the consumption of alcohol, as it was seen as a threat to a family&rsquo;s integrity).</p><p>The newly created NAWSA began to focus its efforts on gaining the vote in each state. <strong>Colorado (1893), Utah (1896), and Idaho (1896) granted suffrage soon after NAWSA was founded</strong>. These states, alongside Wyoming, remained the only US states to grant women the right to vote until 1910.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="e59a1e51-200b-4dd9-b5f6-3c5e1d7f8a87">Strategies of the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement at the beginning of the 20th century</h2><p>After Stanton&rsquo;s death in 1902, and Anthony&rsquo;s in 1906, a new generation of suffragists seemed to fail in proposing innovative strategies&nbsp;and alienated both working-class men and&nbsp;African-Americans&nbsp; through a superior and discriminatory attitude.</p><p>Various strategies were adopted for furthering the movement. In Washington, for example,<strong> NAWSA organiser Emma Smith DeVoe took a moderate approach</strong> to campaigning for a referendum, insisting upon creating good publicity and slowly gaining the community&rsquo;s support by attending meetings with churches, associations, and labour and farmer groups.</p><p>Suffragists were more aggressive in California, where they organised large public rallies, gave public speeches, printed and distributed a large amount of informative materials, and organised coordinated press work.&nbsp;The public rally strategy gained more attention, as it was more appealing to the new generation of younger suffragists. By 1914, NAWSA&rsquo;s intensive lobbying efforts were partially successful and a new set of&nbsp;states allowed women to vote&nbsp;&ndash; Washington (1910), California (1911), Oregon and Arizona (1912), Nevada and Montana (1914).</p><p>However, the NAWSA was still seen as a moderate organisation, and some suffragists were dissatisfied with the slow progress made by the movement. The dissatisfaction led to the creation of the Congressional Union in 1913, later named <strong>the National Woman&rsquo;s Party</strong>. The organisation&nbsp;was created&nbsp;by Alice Paul, a young Quaker activist who knew about the&nbsp;aggressive tactics implemented by English suffragettes.</p><p>From 1913 to 1916, Alice Paul and the members of the National Woman&rsquo;s Party organised marches, rallies, and parades, which drew national attention&nbsp;but also heavy criticism from moderate suffragists. Alice Paul and other members of the party soon began to feel that their public events, as well as their efforts for lobbying and petitioning, had been ineffective.</p><p>In 1917, they began to protest in front of&nbsp;the White House and attack the administration led by President Woodrow Wilson, who claimed to support women&rsquo;s suffrage but rejected resolutions proposed by suffragists.</p><p>From 11<sup>th</sup> of January, 1917, each day a group of women marched to the White House to form <strong>a picket line</strong>. This became a movement in itself, with suffragists travelling from all states to take their place on the picket line. Banners with controversial messages attracted mob violence and vandalism, and the protesters&nbsp;were arrested for the first time on 20<sup>th</sup> of June, 1917. However, the protests continued, and suffragists also followed President Wilson at some of the events he attended, holding banners and reminding him of his claim that he supported their cause.</p><p>The NAWSA adopted another strategy in its pursuit to secure voting rights for women. Despite being pacifists, <strong>many women involved with the NAWSA supported Wilson&rsquo;s administration&rsquo;s decision to intervene in World War I</strong>. This was because they could use Wilson&rsquo;s argument that intervening in the war would secure democracy in the US, and then&nbsp;add&nbsp;that true democracy could only be achieved when the right to vote was extended to women as well.</p><h2 id="heading-6" data-guid="6c8198f5-f265-4ebd-bf3a-2fcd45b2f755">Arrests and imprisonment of NWP activists</h2><p>NWP activists were often arrested, tried, and even imprisoned. During these experiences, suffragists devised a series of tactics to deal with how they were treated both in court and in detention. Their response to their arrests and imprisonment were inspired by the British suffrage movement.</p><p>First, the suffragists imprisoned at the District of Columbia jail and at Virginia&rsquo;s Occoquan Workhouse <strong>demanded to be treated as political prisoners</strong>, to highlight the political motivation behind their arrests&nbsp;and draw attention to the way in which the Wilson administration treated their efforts to gain suffrage.</p><p>In Occoquan, NWP prisoners suffered at the hands of violent guards, who used both physical force and intimidation tactics&nbsp;to discourage them and other women from protesting.</p><p>In the autumn of 1917, jailed NWP members employed another tactic to resist&nbsp;imprisonment, and <strong>refused to do their assigned&nbsp;manual labour</strong>. Furthermore, they began <strong>hunger strikes</strong>, which led to threats of being transferred to institutions for the insane, verbal abuse, isolation from other prisoners and even violent forced feedings.</p><p>The mistreatment of jailed NWP members led to a public outcry which saw the release of&nbsp;suffrage activists at the end of November 1917. In 1918 and 1919, other women were imprisoned, as <strong>protesting continued</strong> in front of the White House, the US Capitol, and&nbsp;the Congressional office buildings.</p><h2 id="heading-7" data-guid="96731fe4-9761-474a-83b8-10dd66503eeb">The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</h2><p>Originally introduced in the Senate in 1878 by Senator Aaron A. Sargent of California, a dedicated advocate for women&rsquo;s right to vote, <strong>the voting rights amendment was rejected a few times before being ratified</strong>. Its 1878 rejection was followed by the suffragists&rsquo; efforts continue to push for the right to vote in individual states and territories, and the employment of more militant tactics from groups such as the National Woman&rsquo;s Party<em>.</em> The amendment was considered again in 1914, but was once more rejected.</p><p>Despite the radical tactics of groups such as the National Woman&rsquo;s Party, which drew the public&rsquo;s attention to the issue of women&rsquo;s suffrage,<strong> the more moderate National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) often gets historical credit&nbsp;for the final push that led to the ratification of the amendment</strong>.</p><p>NAWSA&rsquo;s leader, Carrie Chapman Catt, decided to support the US&rsquo;s involvement in World War I&nbsp;and, thus, earned the support of President Wilson, who urged Congress to pass the voting rights amendment. After the proposed amendment failed to gain the necessary votes&nbsp;to be passed, President Wilson called for a special session of the Congress so that the proposal would be considered again.</p><p>On 18<sup>th</sup> of August, 1920, Tennessee was the last state to pass the amendment, thus making it possible for it to be included in the Constitution. <strong>The 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment of the US Constitution</strong> prohibits the federal government and the states from denying the right to vote to US citizens on the basis of sex&nbsp;and represents the culmination of the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement in the US.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="womens-rights-movement-uk.html" title="The Women&#x27;s Rights Movement in the UK" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Women&#x27;s Rights Movement in the UK</span></a><a href="the-20th-century.html" title="Feminism in the 20th century" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Feminism in the 20th century</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

The document was to be modified before being put forward for signatures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Declaration listed several causes of complaint in regard to laws that limited or denied women\u0026rsquo;s rights to money and property, as well as to education and professional careers. Furthermore, the Declaration stated that women should be allowed to vote in elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWomen\u0026rsquo;s right to vote sparked a debate\u003c/strong\u003e and even Mott advised it should be removed from the Declaration. However, Frederick Douglass, a former slave who became a leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, advocated for women\u0027s suffrage, and the concept was eventually included in the Declaration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Declaration was signed by 100 attendees, mostly women, out of 300 present at the Convention. The document and the Seneca Falls Convention are viewed today as revolutionary steps in the fight for women\u0026rsquo;s equality in society. Moreover, the Declaration gained much attention for the issue of women\u0026rsquo;s right to vote at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Seneca Falls Convention was quickly followed by other conventions, and led to the creation of \u003cstrong\u003ea series of national women\u0026rsquo;s rights conventions\u003c/strong\u003e which were organised annually until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d1b6e5e3-bdbe-499c-b1be-ec8d4557fab1\u0022\u003eWomen\u0026rsquo;s suffrage after the Civil War\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the American Civil War ended in 1865, two major events stimulated the rise of the women\u0026rsquo;s rights movement, which had lost momentum with the beginning of the war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1866, the American Equal Rights Association (AERA) was created by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The organisation\u0026rsquo;s members were both white and black women and men, and their purpose was to secure equal rights to all American citizens, especially the right of suffrage. In the following year, the AERA conducted two major campaigns in New York and Kansas. In New York, AERA sought public support for women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage and for the removal of property requirements that discriminated against African Americans, by collecting petitions. In Kansas, they campaigned for the organisation of a direct vote\u0026nbsp;on the issue of women and African Americans\u0026rsquo; right to vote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, both the New York and Kansas campaigns encountered \u003cstrong\u003eresistance from those who thought that gaining suffrage for African-American men was a priority\u003c/strong\u003e. This disagreement created a divide\u0026nbsp;within the AERA\u0026nbsp;and within the women\u0026rsquo;s rights movement itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second major event that affected the course of the women\u0026rsquo;s rights\u0026nbsp;movement was \u003cstrong\u003etwo controversial Amendments to the US Constitution\u003c/strong\u003e. The 14\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e Amendment, ratified in 1868, extended the Constitution\u0026rsquo;s protection to all citizens, but it defined \u0026ldquo;citizens\u0026rdquo; as male and\u0026nbsp;thus\u0026nbsp;explicitly discriminated against women. The 15\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e Amendment, ratified in 1870, denied limiting the right to\u0026nbsp;vote based on race, colour, or former slave status and, and was\u0026nbsp;meant to guarantee\u0026nbsp;suffrage for African-American men, but once again did not help women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 1869, women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage was granted for the first time in the US, in the state of Wyoming\u003c/strong\u003e. The first woman to vote in a general election in the US was Louisa Ann Swain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u002232ab3eb0-c810-4ecc-9ffc-7f947afb1c30\u0022\u003eThe fight for\u0026nbsp;women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage in the late 19\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen\u0026rsquo;s access to higher education improved with the creation of public and private women\u0026rsquo;s colleges, which meant that more women could be educated and gain an interest in social change. Moreover, because these women were \u003cstrong\u003elargely excluded from the workforce even though they had higher education\u003c/strong\u003e, many of them became involved with the women\u0026rsquo;s rights movement to seek reform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen\u0026rsquo;s suffrage encountered opposition in different forms and at different levels in society.\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eOn the labour market, they encountered opposition from men who were hostile\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;because women were becoming competitors\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;because the men\u0027s\u0026nbsp;role as family breadwinners was challenged. This working class opposition greatly affected state campaigns for women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage, but the opposition lessened when suffragists changed their rhetoric and started to present women\u0026rsquo;s right to vote as a way to empower and protect the working class as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a political level, suffragists had \u003cstrong\u003ethe enormous task of\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003egaining support from all political parties\u003c/strong\u003e; otherwise, the topic of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage just became another reason for political disagreement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnti-suffrage organisations\u003c/strong\u003e also began to appear during the 1890s. Some groups of women who otherwise sought social reform and campaigned for women\u0026rsquo;s rights were anti-suffragist because they believed women\u0026rsquo;s involvement in politics would affect the image of moral superiority and purity they were seeking to present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuffragists\u0026rsquo; groups were often poorly funded, politically inexperienced, and too small\u003c/strong\u003e to organise state-wide campaigns to gather signatures or convince people to participate in referendums. When referendums\u0026nbsp;on women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage were organised, most of them failed. However, suffragists gained new insight and experience which helped them start organisations, develop management skills, and learn to navigate the political system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective 1 - \u0022The Yellow Wallpaper\u0022 by Kate Chopin\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eKate Chopin\u0026rsquo;s short story was written in 1894, when there were several active movements for women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage.

Though there is no direct mention of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage in the short story, its main themes include\u0026nbsp;freedom and independence from men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective 3 - \u0022A Pair of Silk Stockings\u0022 by Kate Chopin\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;A Pair of Silk Stockings\u0026rdquo; explores the theme of women\u0026rsquo;s desire for self-fulfillment at the end of the nineteenth century. During that period, women\u0026rsquo;s liberation movements were still in early phases, and traditional roles were still dominant. The story\u0026nbsp;shows how women had very few options for self-fulfillment, as it was generally assumed they should focus on being wives and mothers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u00223a3ef028-bc7d-4ab5-bdda-95c91b6ee0d9\u0022\u003eThe National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 1880s, \u003cstrong\u003emany middle-class women\u003c/strong\u003e who sought to expand their activities beyond\u0026nbsp;domestic life \u0026ndash; members of women\u0026rsquo;s clubs, activists in progressive causes, and advocates of\u0026nbsp;temperance, as well as participants in local charity organisations \u0026ndash; began to support the NWSA and the AWSA. Many of these women were also advocates for social reform, as they\u0026nbsp;had realised they had little political influence without the right to vote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe newly gained support from women in associations such as the National Consumers League, the Woman\u0026rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, and the Women\u0026rsquo;s Trade Union League, as well as NWSA\u0026rsquo;s shift in focus from the federal level to the state level \u003cstrong\u003econvinced the NWSA and AWSA to unite and form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)\u003c/strong\u003e in 1890. The association was led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, one of the founders of the AWSA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote, however, \u003cstrong\u003ethat suffrage for African-American women was not a priority for many white suffragists\u003c/strong\u003e. Moreover, some white suffragists openly expressed their prejudice against African Americans both in their rhetoric and actions. Southern suffragists often rejected the participation of African-American women in the movement\u0026nbsp;and maintained a strategy that aimed to enfranchise white women to outvote African Americans and preserve white dominance in the area. Anthony initially sought to keep the issue of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage separate from the race issue. However, because she wanted the Southern suffragists and conservative politicians on her side, she compromised and endorsed \u0026ldquo;educated suffrage\u0026rdquo; (meaning the voters should be literate), while refusing to help black suffragists. NAWSA eventually retreated from the Southern state campaigns, as these states not only rejected women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage, but also passed reforms to disenfranchise African-American men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfrican-American women, who were not allowed membership in white women\u0026rsquo;s organisations, formed their own associations\u003c/strong\u003e. The Association of Colored Women\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e formed in 1896, for example, advocated for suffrage but also sought to raise awareness concerning disenfranchisement, racial segregation, and violence against African-American women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides forming a new, larger organisation, \u003cstrong\u003ethe suffragists also changed their approach\u003c/strong\u003e. Their rhetoric was initially constructed on the idea that women were equal to men\u0026nbsp;and, therefore, deserved to enjoy the same rights as them. The suffragists now began to advocate for the women\u0026rsquo;s right to vote because of their domestic nature, which would provide a more moral stance in politics. The shift in approach is said to be partially inspired by the temperance movement (which sought restrictions on the consumption of alcohol, as it was seen as a threat to a family\u0026rsquo;s integrity).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe newly created NAWSA began to focus its efforts on gaining the vote in each state. \u003cstrong\u003eColorado (1893), Utah (1896), and Idaho (1896) granted suffrage soon after NAWSA was founded\u003c/strong\u003e. These states, alongside Wyoming, remained the only US states to grant women the right to vote until 1910.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e59a1e51-200b-4dd9-b5f6-3c5e1d7f8a87\u0022\u003eStrategies of the women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage movement at the beginning of the 20th century\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Stanton\u0026rsquo;s death in 1902, and Anthony\u0026rsquo;s in 1906, a new generation of suffragists seemed to fail in proposing innovative strategies\u0026nbsp;and alienated both working-class men and\u0026nbsp;African-Americans\u0026nbsp; through a superior and discriminatory attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVarious strategies were adopted for furthering the movement. In Washington, for example,\u003cstrong\u003e NAWSA organiser Emma Smith DeVoe took a moderate approach\u003c/strong\u003e to campaigning for a referendum, insisting upon creating good publicity and slowly gaining the community\u0026rsquo;s support by attending meetings with churches, associations, and labour and farmer groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuffragists were more aggressive in California, where they organised large public rallies, gave public speeches, printed and distributed a large amount of informative materials, and organised coordinated press work.\u0026nbsp;The public rally strategy gained more attention, as it was more appealing to the new generation of younger suffragists. By 1914, NAWSA\u0026rsquo;s intensive lobbying efforts were partially successful and a new set of\u0026nbsp;states allowed women to vote\u0026nbsp;\u0026ndash; Washington (1910), California (1911), Oregon and Arizona (1912), Nevada and Montana (1914).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the NAWSA was still seen as a moderate organisation, and some suffragists were dissatisfied with the slow progress made by the movement. The dissatisfaction led to the creation of the Congressional Union in 1913, later named \u003cstrong\u003ethe National Woman\u0026rsquo;s Party\u003c/strong\u003e. The organisation\u0026nbsp;was created\u0026nbsp;by Alice Paul, a young Quaker activist who knew about the\u0026nbsp;aggressive tactics implemented by English suffragettes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom 1913 to 1916, Alice Paul and the members of the National Woman\u0026rsquo;s Party organised marches, rallies, and parades, which drew national attention\u0026nbsp;but also heavy criticism from moderate suffragists. Alice Paul and other members of the party soon began to feel that their public events, as well as their efforts for lobbying and petitioning, had been ineffective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1917, they began to protest in front of\u0026nbsp;the White House and attack the administration led by President Woodrow Wilson, who claimed to support women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage but rejected resolutions proposed by suffragists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom 11\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of January, 1917, each day a group of women marched to the White House to form \u003cstrong\u003ea picket line\u003c/strong\u003e. This became a movement in itself, with suffragists travelling from all states to take their place on the picket line. Banners with controversial messages attracted mob violence and vandalism, and the protesters\u0026nbsp;were arrested for the first time on 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of June, 1917. However, the protests continued, and suffragists also followed President Wilson at some of the events he attended, holding banners and reminding him of his claim that he supported their cause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe NAWSA adopted another strategy in its pursuit to secure voting rights for women. Despite being pacifists, \u003cstrong\u003emany women involved with the NAWSA supported Wilson\u0026rsquo;s administration\u0026rsquo;s decision to intervene in World War I\u003c/strong\u003e. This was because they could use Wilson\u0026rsquo;s argument that intervening in the war would secure democracy in the US, and then\u0026nbsp;add\u0026nbsp;that true democracy could only be achieved when the right to vote was extended to women as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-6\u0022 data-guid=\u00226c8198f5-f265-4ebd-bf3a-2fcd45b2f755\u0022\u003eArrests and imprisonment of NWP activists\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNWP activists were often arrested, tried, and even imprisoned. During these experiences, suffragists devised a series of tactics to deal with how they were treated both in court and in detention. Their response to their arrests and imprisonment were inspired by the British suffrage movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, the suffragists imprisoned at the District of Columbia jail and at Virginia\u0026rsquo;s Occoquan Workhouse \u003cstrong\u003edemanded to be treated as political prisoners\u003c/strong\u003e, to highlight the political motivation behind their arrests\u0026nbsp;and draw attention to the way in which the Wilson administration treated their efforts to gain suffrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Occoquan, NWP prisoners suffered at the hands of violent guards, who used both physical force and intimidation tactics\u0026nbsp;to discourage them and other women from protesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the autumn of 1917, jailed NWP members employed another tactic to resist\u0026nbsp;imprisonment, and \u003cstrong\u003erefused to do their assigned\u0026nbsp;manual labour\u003c/strong\u003e. Furthermore, they began \u003cstrong\u003ehunger strikes\u003c/strong\u003e, which led to threats of being transferred to institutions for the insane, verbal abuse, isolation from other prisoners and even violent forced feedings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mistreatment of jailed NWP members led to a public outcry which saw the release of\u0026nbsp;suffrage activists at the end of November 1917. In 1918 and 1919, other women were imprisoned, as \u003cstrong\u003eprotesting continued\u003c/strong\u003e in front of the White House, the US Capitol, and\u0026nbsp;the Congressional office buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-7\u0022 data-guid=\u002296731fe4-9761-474a-83b8-10dd66503eeb\u0022\u003eThe Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginally introduced in the Senate in 1878 by Senator Aaron A. Sargent of California, a dedicated advocate for women\u0026rsquo;s right to vote, \u003cstrong\u003ethe voting rights amendment was rejected a few times before being ratified\u003c/strong\u003e. Its 1878 rejection was followed by the suffragists\u0026rsquo; efforts continue to push for the right to vote in individual states and territories, and the employment of more militant tactics from groups such as the National Woman\u0026rsquo;s Party\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e The amendment was considered again in 1914, but was once more rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the radical tactics of groups such as the National Woman\u0026rsquo;s Party, which drew the public\u0026rsquo;s attention to the issue of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage,\u003cstrong\u003e the more moderate National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) often gets historical credit\u0026nbsp;for the final push that led to the ratification of the amendment\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNAWSA\u0026rsquo;s leader, Carrie Chapman Catt, decided to support the US\u0026rsquo;s involvement in World War I\u0026nbsp;and, thus, earned the support of President Wilson, who urged Congress to pass the voting rights amendment. After the proposed amendment failed to gain the necessary votes\u0026nbsp;to be passed, President Wilson called for a special session of the Congress so that the proposal would be considered again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn 18\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of August, 1920, Tennessee was the last state to pass the amendment, thus making it possible for it to be included in the Constitution. \u003cstrong\u003eThe 19\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e Amendment of the US Constitution\u003c/strong\u003e prohibits the federal government and the states from denying the right to vote to US citizens on the basis of sex\u0026nbsp;and represents the culmination of the women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage movement in the US.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"The Women\u0027s Rights Movement in the US","MetaDescription":"The women’s rights movement in the US is generally considered to have begun with a meeting in Seneca Falls, New York, in July, 1848.
