Once online, feminism expanded its goals, focusing more on including and empowering people with diverse identities and abilities.</p><p><strong>Issues that feminists currently focus on</strong> are rape culture, body shaming, sexism in the media, and online misogyny, as well as sexual harassment and discrimination in public and in the workplace.</p><p>These issues are <strong>discussed on social media platforms</strong> such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, or YouTube, and on feminist blogs and other online publications. Social media is also used to organise events, gather signatures for petitions, and draw attention to the mistreatment of women in society.</p><p>Several scandals involving the abuse, harassment, and murder of women have gained worldwide attention through social media, such as the 2012 Delhi gang rape, the 2014 Bill Cosby allegations, as well as <a href="the-movement.html">the 2017 Harvey Weinstein allegations and the #MeToo movement</a> that followed.</p><p><strong>Feminism&rsquo;s dependency on social media has sometimes been criticised</strong>. Firstly, it has been debated whether the high level of online activism might imply less real life activism - and&nbsp;less actual change in society.&nbsp;However, others argue that this is not the case, since social media has played a key role in feminist protests organised worldwide.</p><p>Secondly, the idea of access to technology and social media has been discussed &ndash; since not everyone has equal access to digital media, 21<sup>st&nbsp;</sup>century feminism has sometimes been accused of excluding people from lower classes and people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="0857ae21-5b5f-4b53-b6f6-b86e237fcd5f">Lipstick feminism</h2><p>In recent years, a type of feminism popularly called &ldquo;lipstick feminism&rdquo; has emerged. The term &ldquo;lipstick feminism&rdquo; refers to the idea that women can feel empowered by traditional ideas and manifestations of sensuality and sexuality &ndash; such as the use of make-up, typically feminine and sensual clothing, etc.</p><p>Lipstick feminists <strong>place&nbsp;much importance on choice</strong>, arguing that a woman can embrace traditional femininity and still be a feminist. Moreover, women are encouraged to use their sexuality to express themselves.</p><p>Another idea of lipstick feminism is to reclaim derogatory terms against women. One of the best known social movements related to lipstick feminism is <strong>SlutWalk</strong>, which began in 2011. SlutWalk is an international series of protests against rape culture and, more specifically, against the idea that women are held responsible for sexual violence because of the way they dress.</p><p>The ideas behind lipstick feminism have also been embraced in the entertainment industry. Artists such as Beyonc&eacute;, Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus have been praised for promoting sex positivity and challenging stereotypes about gender roles in their music and&nbsp;performances. Hollywood has also been challenging gender stereotypes in recent years, producing more films that place women in strong lead roles.</p><p>Lipstick feminism, however, has also received some&nbsp;criticism, even from other feminists. Critics believe it reinforces traditional gender stereotypes&nbsp;and that the women who subscribe to it objectify themselves under the guise of empowerment.</p><div class="toggle-box"><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text">Textual perspective - "Commencement Address at Wellesley College" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</span><div class="toggle-box-handle">&nbsp;</div></header><div class="toggle-box-content"><p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's speech can be seen as advocating&nbsp;feminism in that she encourages the female graduates to use their influence in their future professional lives to promote the status of women. Adichie&nbsp;distances herself from the notion that feminism should be a closed club reserved for the "right opinions", but instead wants it to be&nbsp;an inclusive group that allows many forms of feminism.</p></div></div><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="6ece0594-41ba-4563-9046-409cb5a2a242">Current challenges for feminism and women&rsquo;s rights</h2><p>All over the world, <strong>conservative political tendencies&nbsp;</strong>represent a threat to the women&rsquo;s rights movement. In 2018 alone, Poland&rsquo;s right-wing nationalist government pushed for the ban of abortions, while Hungary banned gender studies in universities, labelling the topic of gender as an ideology rather than science. The 2016 presidential campaign in the US was also plagued by misogynist rhetoric, with Donald Trump and his supporters in particular often making sexist&nbsp;remarks about&nbsp;both&nbsp;Hillary Clinton and other women who participated in the political debate.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision that established women&rsquo;s constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court, currently comprised mostly of conservative judges, has decided this on the basis that the right to abortion is not "deeply rooted in this Nation&rsquo;s history or tradition". Following the ruling, individual states can now ban abortions, and almost half of US states<span style="color:rgb(32,33,36);">&mdash;</span>mostly majority republican states<span style="color:rgb(32,33,36);">&mdash;</span>are in the process of doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>A growing number of&nbsp;<strong>antifeminist movements</strong>&nbsp;have&nbsp;also become an internet trend in recent years. Members of these movements&nbsp;either challenge specific aspects of feminism or deny its necessity altogether, since they claim&nbsp;that women are already treated equally to men. Other antifeminists falsely consider feminism as an attempt to prove women&rsquo;s superiority over men. In general, online&nbsp;communities of men&rsquo;s rights activists, male supremacists, or '<span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>Short for &ldquo;involuntary celibates&rdquo;, usually referring to&amp;nbsp;men who have not had any&amp;nbsp;sexual relationships, despite wanting to. Many incel communities express strongly misogynist views.</p>">incels'</span>&nbsp;often discuss openly antifeminist and misogynist ideas.</p><p>Consequently, today&rsquo;s feminism is faced with both a misunderstanding of what feminism represents&nbsp;and society&rsquo;s deeply ingrained sexism and misogyny, which are still manifested in the media, in the workplace, in the streets, as well as on the internet.</p><div class="toggle-box"><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text">Textual perspective 1 - "HeForShe Speech" by Emma Watson</span><div class="toggle-box-handle">&nbsp;</div></header><div class="toggle-box-content"><p>Watson&rsquo;s speech focuses on the importance of feminism for promoting equal rights and eliminating gender bias for both women and men.&nbsp;Watson argues that gender equality can only be advanced if men also support and promote it.[/ProductEmbed]</p></div></div><div class="toggle-box"><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text">Textual perspective 2 - "The Shape of a Star" by Jen Knox</span><div class="toggle-box-handle">&nbsp;</div></header><div class="toggle-box-content"><p>The social setting presents an important issues:&nbsp;the break off with traditional patterns when it comes to women and &ldquo;men&rsquo;s jobs&rdquo;. The story focuses on the way women are viewed upon practicing what we currently deem as &ldquo;men&rsquo;s jobs&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>The Gamergate controversy</h3><p>One case in particular brought the public's attention to the <strong>widespread misogyny on the internet</strong>, particularly related to the traditionally male-dominated field of gaming.</p><p>In 2013, the female game designer <strong>Zoë&nbsp;Quinn</strong> produced <i>Depression Quest</i>, an experimental adventure game about dealing with depression. In 2014, Quinn's former boyfriend published a very critical blog post about her, which&nbsp;claimed (falsely) that Quinn&nbsp;had slept with a games journalist to secure a positive&nbsp;review for her game. This false accusation sparked an extreme harassment campaign against both Quinn and her family - involving death threats, rape threats, <span class="explanation" data-explanation="<p>'Doxing' refers to getting access to an individual's personal documents and posting the contents online - typically revealing personal data such as home address and phone number. It's a frequently used&amp;nbsp;tool in online harassment campaigns.</p>">doxing</span> and hacking - which eventually forced her to leave her home. The harassment campaign adapted the hashtag #GamerGate, probably in an attempt to allude to the Watergate scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Gamergate harassment campaign soon spread further than Quinn, as harassers also attacked media representatives who spoke out in defense of her. Furthermore, they also began to&nbsp;attack&nbsp;other women who tried to call attention to the misogynistic culture within many gaming communities - and the misogynistic elements inherent in the design of many video games. One such victim was <strong>Anita Sarkeesian</strong>, a gaming journalist who produced a video series called <i>Tropes vs. Women in Video Games</i>, which tried to call attention to common elements in games that present women in a negative light (such as the stereotype of the&nbsp;passive "damsel in distress", whom the male hero has to rescue).&nbsp;</p><p>Gamergate was a very loosely organised community, so it was often difficult to locate and prosecute the people responsible for death threats and other crimes. In September 2015, the FBI called&nbsp;off much their investigation, as they claimed to have no leads left. However, many criticised the FBI for giving in too easily, and for not taking online harassment seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Gamergate brought attention to widespread misogynistic attitudes within gaming communities, which meant&nbsp;that both game designers and managers of online communities have become more aware of the issue.

Firstly, it has been debated whether the high level of online activism might imply less real life activism - and\u0026nbsp;less actual change in society.\u0026nbsp;However, others argue that this is not the case, since social media has played a key role in feminist protests organised worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, the idea of access to technology and social media has been discussed \u0026ndash; since not everyone has equal access to digital media, 21\u003csup\u003est\u0026nbsp;\u003c/sup\u003ecentury feminism has sometimes been accused of excluding people from lower classes and people with disabilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00220857ae21-5b5f-4b53-b6f6-b86e237fcd5f\u0022\u003eLipstick feminism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, a type of feminism popularly called \u0026ldquo;lipstick feminism\u0026rdquo; has emerged. The term \u0026ldquo;lipstick feminism\u0026rdquo; refers to the idea that women can feel empowered by traditional ideas and manifestations of sensuality and sexuality \u0026ndash; such as the use of make-up, typically feminine and sensual clothing, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLipstick feminists \u003cstrong\u003eplace\u0026nbsp;much importance on choice\u003c/strong\u003e, arguing that a woman can embrace traditional femininity and still be a feminist. Moreover, women are encouraged to use their sexuality to express themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother idea of lipstick feminism is to reclaim derogatory terms against women. One of the best known social movements related to lipstick feminism is \u003cstrong\u003eSlutWalk\u003c/strong\u003e, which began in 2011. SlutWalk is an international series of protests against rape culture and, more specifically, against the idea that women are held responsible for sexual violence because of the way they dress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ideas behind lipstick feminism have also been embraced in the entertainment industry. Artists such as Beyonc\u0026eacute;, Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus have been praised for promoting sex positivity and challenging stereotypes about gender roles in their music and\u0026nbsp;performances. Hollywood has also been challenging gender stereotypes in recent years, producing more films that place women in strong lead roles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLipstick feminism, however, has also received some\u0026nbsp;criticism, even from other feminists. Critics believe it reinforces traditional gender stereotypes\u0026nbsp;and that the women who subscribe to it objectify themselves under the guise of empowerment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022\u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022\u003eTextual perspective - \u0022Commencement Address at Wellesley College\u0022 by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022\u003e\u003cp\u003eChimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u0027s speech can be seen as advocating\u0026nbsp;feminism in that she encourages the female graduates to use their influence in their future professional lives to promote the status of women.

The 2016 presidential campaign in the US was also plagued by misogynist rhetoric, with Donald Trump and his supporters in particular often making sexist\u0026nbsp;remarks about\u0026nbsp;both\u0026nbsp;Hillary Clinton and other women who participated in the political debate.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
