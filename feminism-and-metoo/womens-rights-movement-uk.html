Before then, a few women had the right to vote through land ownership, although this was a rare occurrence. Then,<strong> the Reform Act of 1832</strong> enfranchised only &ldquo;male persons&rdquo;, thus banning women from voting and creating the circumstances in which the suffrage movement began in the UK.</p><p>In August of the same year,<strong> the first petition for women&rsquo;s suffrage was presented to Parliament by Mary Smith from Yorkshire</strong>. Henry Hunt, a&nbsp;Member of Parliament (MP), agreed with the petition and argued publicly that single, taxpaying women who had sufficient property should be allowed to vote.</p><p>However, other social issues took the spotlight away from women&rsquo;s suffrage. For example, members of the Chartist&nbsp;movement&nbsp;(a working-class movement for political reform), focused more on gaining universal male suffrage, even though they also&nbsp;supported women&rsquo;s suffrage. Even some campaigners for women&rsquo;s rights also tended to focus&nbsp;on other issues, such as the right for married women to own property&nbsp;and the right to sue an ex-husband after divorce.</p><p>The issue of women&rsquo;s suffrage did not gain momentum until 1865, when the philosopher&nbsp;<strong>John Stuart Mill stood for office with a platform that included direct support for women&rsquo;s voting rights</strong>.</p><p>After John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s election as MP for the City of Westminster, Leigh Smith Bodichon, an English educationalist and artist, formed <strong>the first Women&rsquo;s Suffrage Committee</strong> and collected over 1500 signatures in support of women&rsquo;s suffrage. She presented the petition to John Stuart Mill and Henry Fawcett, another MP who supported universal suffrage.</p><p>The petition convinced Mill to draft&nbsp;an amendment which gave women the same political rights as men, and present it to Parliament . However, the amendment was rejected, and the defeat led to the formation of <strong>the London Society for Women&rsquo;s Suffrage</strong>, with John Stuart Mill as president.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="29f8b8bb-bb2a-4234-a654-3442d3bda483">National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies</h2><p>Similar organisations to the London Society for Women&rsquo;s Suffrage were founded all over Britain in the following years and 17 of these organisations joined together to form the National Union of Women&rsquo;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) in 1897. The NUWSS was <strong>led by Millicent Fawcett</strong>, a British activist, writer, and political leader who went on to become a prominent campaigner for women&rsquo;s suffrage.</p><p>The NUWSS was <strong>a peaceful organisation, which aimed to achieve women&rsquo;s suffrage through legal, non-confrontational means</strong> such as proposing Parliamentary Bills, organising informative meetings, distributing informative materials, and gathering signatures for petitions.</p><p>In 1903, members who believed that the peaceful campaign was not effective split from the NUWSS and formed <strong>the Women&rsquo;s Social and Political Union (WSPU)</strong>. The media described this new movement as&nbsp;&ldquo;the suffragettes&rdquo;&nbsp;to be differentiate them from their more peaceful counterparts, the suffragists.</p><p>In 1907, the NUWSS organised <strong>the United Procession of Women</strong>, also known as the Mud March because of the heavy rain that day. The event saw more than three thousand women marching peacefully in London in support of women&rsquo;s suffrage.</p><p>Although it failed to bring on parliamentary change (a new suffrage bill introduced soon after the march was mostly ignored),&nbsp;the march&nbsp;attracted the media&rsquo;s attention and marked a positive change in public perception on the issue of women&rsquo;s suffrage.</p><p>The NUWSS organised several marches in the following years. The best known of these marches are<strong> the 1908 Women&rsquo;s Sunday in Hyde Park</strong>, attended by almost half a million people, and <strong>the Great Pilgrimage of 1913</strong>, where women from all over the country marched to London for a mass rally.</p><p>By 1914, the NUWSS had more than 100,000 members, most of them middle- or upper-class. They largely campaigned for suffrage for property-owning women but some of them recognised the need to be supported by all women, thus allowing the participation of working-class women in the NUWSS actions as well.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="dc567faa-1be4-4a81-8137-98cd45f08164">The suffragettes</h2><p>Suffragettes were women who fought for women&rsquo;s suffrage using more confrontational methods than the suffragists. The term &ldquo;suffragettes&rdquo;, originally used by a <em>Daily Mail</em> journalist to mock the activists, was later <strong>adopted by members of the British Women&rsquo;s Social and Political Union (WSPU).</strong></p><p>WSPU was a women-only organisation which adopted the motto<strong> &ldquo;deeds, not words&rdquo;</strong> to represent their intent to advocate for suffrage through more radical means than simple petitions and peaceful marches. However, their relationship with the original organisation, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, remained mostly friendly, with suffragists speaking in support of suffragettes&nbsp;before their actions became more violent.</p><p>The suffragettes used several tactics&nbsp;to gain attention for the issue of women&rsquo;s suffrage. In 1905, for example, <strong>Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney interrupted speeches by Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Grey</strong>, asking their position on women&rsquo;s rights and holding a banner on which they had written &ldquo;Votes for Women&rdquo;. This act was seen as being disruptive. and the two were arrested for assault on a policeman. They preferred to go to jail instead of paying a fine, to gain publicity. This was just the first in a series of arrests which led to WSPU members choosing jail to gain publicity for their cause.</p><p>In the following years, the WSPU organised other protests, as well as publicity stunts such as the design of special jewellery and clothing which could be worn in support of suffrage, as well as the design of a humorous board game in which players had to move a suffragette figure past several obstacles on her way to parliament.</p><p>In 1907, some of the members of WSPU, unhappy with the organisation&rsquo;s sometimes violent approach, formed a different organisation, called <strong>the <em>Women&rsquo;s Freedom League</em> (WFL)</strong>. Although they continued to collaborate with the WSPU on some elements of the campaign for suffrage, the WFL preferred peaceful demonstrations and actions.</p><p><strong>By 1914, the suffragettes had turned to more violent actions</strong>, such as damaging public property, chaining themselves to railings, and even detonating bombs and setting fires in churches, including Westminster Abbey. One of the suffragettes, Emily Davison, died in 1913 after stepping in front of the King&rsquo;s horse at Epsom Derby. Her death was debated, as some proposed she killed herself intentionally to become a martyr for the cause.</p><p>Overall, suffragettes have both been credited with furthering the cause of women&rsquo;s suffrage&nbsp;and blamed for damaging it. Historians generally believe that the Pankhursts and their preference for direct action mobilised women to act and support each other. However, at the time, some saw their more violent actions as proof of women&rsquo;s supposed 'irrational nature', which contributed to the arguments against women&rsquo;s suffrage.</p><p>Nonetheless, the suffragettes&rsquo; attitude and actions made them famous, and became an inspiration for some suffragists in the US.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - "Freedom or Death" by Emmeline Pankhurst</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>Emmeline Pankhurst&rsquo;s speech&nbsp;focuses on the topic of&nbsp;women&rsquo;s fight for voting rights in Britain. In exploring this topic, the speaker includes universal themes like revolutionary activism (the use of violence and radical means to advocate&nbsp;one&rsquo;s cause) and gender discrimination.</p></div></div><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="b936ff49-b7f7-4c16-8bbf-d8b8dd303b12">Imprisonment, the &ldquo;Cat and Mouse&rdquo; Act, and the Bodyguard</h2><p>A large number of suffragettes were imprisoned in Britain in the first years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. They were mostly arrested for public order offences and the refusal to pay fines. Often, suffragettes chose to spend time in jail&nbsp;to gain attention for their cause.</p><p>While imprisoned, <strong>the suffragettes sought to be considered political prisoners</strong>, as this would have given them privileges such as being allowed to write books or articles&nbsp;and receive frequent visits. The campaign for imprisoned suffragettes to be considered political prisoners was also undertaken outside of prison by the WSPU, but it was largely unsuccessful.</p><p>As a result, <strong>imprisoned suffragettes staged hunger strikes</strong>, beginning with Marion Wallace Dunlop, who refused food without consulting suffragette leaders. Because Dunlop was freed out of fear she might die and become a martyr for the suffrage, other suffragettes began to refuse food to be released from prison.</p><p>The hunger strikes ceased for two years after Home Secretary Winston Churchill adopted Rule 243A in 1910, which allowed <strong>certain privileges for imprisoned suffragettes</strong>. The hunger strikes began again when the suffragette leader&nbsp;Emmeline Pankhurst received more freedoms than others, which led to other suffragettes to refuse food&nbsp;to protest their own prison status.</p><p>As suffragette demonstrations became more aggressive, the British Government changed its approach and became unwilling to release suffragettes before they had served their sentences. To&nbsp;avoid being held responsible for the deaths of those who refused food,<strong> the prison began to force-feed the hunger strikers using tubes</strong>. The process proved extremely dangerous for suffragettes, as they did not consent to being fed. As a result of the force applied in the&nbsp;process, some suffragettes&rsquo; physical and mental health was affected both in the short and long term.</p><p>In 1913, the Prisoners Act, or <strong>the &ldquo;Cat and Mouse&rdquo; Act</strong> was passed. The act made the hunger strikes legal and stated that hunger strikers may be released but had to return to prison to finish their sentences once they were in good health. The Act absolved the British Government from any responsibility for the striker&rsquo;s health.</p><p>In response to the &ldquo;Cat and Mouse&rdquo; Act, <strong>WSPU created a secret society known as the Bodyguard</strong>. The society&rsquo;s members aimed to protect suffragette leaders from arrest and assault by using the Japanese martial art of Jujitsu. One of the most notable events involving the society was the Battle of Glasgow&nbsp;on 9<sup>th</sup> of March, 1914, when 30 &ldquo;Bodyguards&rdquo; fought about 50 policemen on the stage of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall in Glasgow, Scotland.</p><h2 id="heading-5" data-guid="e384f9a0-c88d-433a-aeca-a126eecb28bb">Women&rsquo;s suffrage in the UK during and after World War I</h2><p>When World War I began, the suffragettes were released from prison on an amnesty, and Pankhurst ended the suffrage activities to focus on the war effort. <strong>The NUWSS continued to lobby during the war years</strong>, while also funding women&rsquo;s hospitals involved in the war. Their lobbying proved successful, as several acts were passed in the following years which contributed to the enfranchisement of women.</p><p>Through <strong>the Representation of the People Act 1918</strong>, over 8 million women in the UK gained the right to vote, as the act enfranchised both men over 21 years of age and women over the age of 30 who met specific&nbsp;property qualifications. At the end of the same year, <strong>the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act</strong> allowed women to be elected into Parliament.</p><p>10 years later, all women over the age of 21 were granted the right to vote on the same terms as men through <strong>the Representation of the People Act 1928</strong>.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../feminism-and-metoo.html" title="Feminism and #MeToo" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Feminism and #MeToo</span></a><a href="womens-rights-movement-us.html" title="The Women&#x27;s Rights Movement in the US" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">The Women&#x27;s Rights Movement in the US</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Henry Hunt, a\u0026nbsp;Member of Parliament (MP), agreed with the petition and argued publicly that single, taxpaying women who had sufficient property should be allowed to vote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, other social issues took the spotlight away from women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage. For example, members of the Chartist\u0026nbsp;movement\u0026nbsp;(a working-class movement for political reform), focused more on gaining universal male suffrage, even though they also\u0026nbsp;supported women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage. Even some campaigners for women\u0026rsquo;s rights also tended to focus\u0026nbsp;on other issues, such as the right for married women to own property\u0026nbsp;and the right to sue an ex-husband after divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe issue of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage did not gain momentum until 1865, when the philosopher\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eJohn Stuart Mill stood for office with a platform that included direct support for women\u0026rsquo;s voting rights\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter John Stuart Mill\u0026rsquo;s election as MP for the City of Westminster, Leigh Smith Bodichon, an English educationalist and artist, formed \u003cstrong\u003ethe first Women\u0026rsquo;s Suffrage Committee\u003c/strong\u003e and collected over 1500 signatures in support of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage. She presented the petition to John Stuart Mill and Henry Fawcett, another MP who supported universal suffrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe petition convinced Mill to draft\u0026nbsp;an amendment which gave women the same political rights as men, and present it to Parliament . However, the amendment was rejected, and the defeat led to the formation of \u003cstrong\u003ethe London Society for Women\u0026rsquo;s Suffrage\u003c/strong\u003e, with John Stuart Mill as president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u002229f8b8bb-bb2a-4234-a654-3442d3bda483\u0022\u003eNational Union of Women\u0027s Suffrage Societies\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilar organisations to the London Society for Women\u0026rsquo;s Suffrage were founded all over Britain in the following years and 17 of these organisations joined together to form the National Union of Women\u0026rsquo;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) in 1897. The NUWSS was \u003cstrong\u003eled by Millicent Fawcett\u003c/strong\u003e, a British activist, writer, and political leader who went on to become a prominent campaigner for women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe NUWSS was \u003cstrong\u003ea peaceful organisation, which aimed to achieve women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage through legal, non-confrontational means\u003c/strong\u003e such as proposing Parliamentary Bills, organising informative meetings, distributing informative materials, and gathering signatures for petitions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1903, members who believed that the peaceful campaign was not effective split from the NUWSS and formed \u003cstrong\u003ethe Women\u0026rsquo;s Social and Political Union (WSPU)\u003c/strong\u003e. The media described this new movement as\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;the suffragettes\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;to be differentiate them from their more peaceful counterparts, the suffragists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1907, the NUWSS organised \u003cstrong\u003ethe United Procession of Women\u003c/strong\u003e, also known as the Mud March because of the heavy rain that day. The event saw more than three thousand women marching peacefully in London in support of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough it failed to bring on parliamentary change (a new suffrage bill introduced soon after the march was mostly ignored),\u0026nbsp;the march\u0026nbsp;attracted the media\u0026rsquo;s attention and marked a positive change in public perception on the issue of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe NUWSS organised several marches in the following years. The best known of these marches are\u003cstrong\u003e the 1908 Women\u0026rsquo;s Sunday in Hyde Park\u003c/strong\u003e, attended by almost half a million people, and \u003cstrong\u003ethe Great Pilgrimage of 1913\u003c/strong\u003e, where women from all over the country marched to London for a mass rally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 1914, the NUWSS had more than 100,000 members, most of them middle- or upper-class. They largely campaigned for suffrage for property-owning women but some of them recognised the need to be supported by all women, thus allowing the participation of working-class women in the NUWSS actions as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022dc567faa-1be4-4a81-8137-98cd45f08164\u0022\u003eThe suffragettes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuffragettes were women who fought for women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage using more confrontational methods than the suffragists. The term \u0026ldquo;suffragettes\u0026rdquo;, originally used by a \u003cem\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/em\u003e journalist to mock the activists, was later \u003cstrong\u003eadopted by members of the British Women\u0026rsquo;s Social and Political Union (WSPU).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWSPU was a women-only organisation which adopted the motto\u003cstrong\u003e \u0026ldquo;deeds, not words\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e to represent their intent to advocate for suffrage through more radical means than simple petitions and peaceful marches. However, their relationship with the original organisation, the National Union of Women\u0027s Suffrage Societies, remained mostly friendly, with suffragists speaking in support of suffragettes\u0026nbsp;before their actions became more violent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe suffragettes used several tactics\u0026nbsp;to gain attention for the issue of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage. In 1905, for example, \u003cstrong\u003eChristabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney interrupted speeches by Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Grey\u003c/strong\u003e, asking their position on women\u0026rsquo;s rights and holding a banner on which they had written \u0026ldquo;Votes for Women\u0026rdquo;. This act was seen as being disruptive. and the two were arrested for assault on a policeman. They preferred to go to jail instead of paying a fine, to gain publicity. This was just the first in a series of arrests which led to WSPU members choosing jail to gain publicity for their cause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the following years, the WSPU organised other protests, as well as publicity stunts such as the design of special jewellery and clothing which could be worn in support of suffrage, as well as the design of a humorous board game in which players had to move a suffragette figure past several obstacles on her way to parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1907, some of the members of WSPU, unhappy with the organisation\u0026rsquo;s sometimes violent approach, formed a different organisation, called \u003cstrong\u003ethe \u003cem\u003eWomen\u0026rsquo;s Freedom League\u003c/em\u003e (WFL)\u003c/strong\u003e. Although they continued to collaborate with the WSPU on some elements of the campaign for suffrage, the WFL preferred peaceful demonstrations and actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy 1914, the suffragettes had turned to more violent actions\u003c/strong\u003e, such as damaging public property, chaining themselves to railings, and even detonating bombs and setting fires in churches, including Westminster Abbey. One of the suffragettes, Emily Davison, died in 1913 after stepping in front of the King\u0026rsquo;s horse at Epsom Derby. Her death was debated, as some proposed she killed herself intentionally to become a martyr for the cause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, suffragettes have both been credited with furthering the cause of women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage\u0026nbsp;and blamed for damaging it. Historians generally believe that the Pankhursts and their preference for direct action mobilised women to act and support each other. However, at the time, some saw their more violent actions as proof of women\u0026rsquo;s supposed \u0027irrational nature\u0027, which contributed to the arguments against women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, the suffragettes\u0026rsquo; attitude and actions made them famous, and became an inspiration for some suffragists in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - \u0022Freedom or Death\u0022 by Emmeline Pankhurst\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eEmmeline Pankhurst\u0026rsquo;s speech\u0026nbsp;focuses on the topic of\u0026nbsp;women\u0026rsquo;s fight for voting rights in Britain. In exploring this topic, the speaker includes universal themes like revolutionary activism (the use of violence and radical means to advocate\u0026nbsp;one\u0026rsquo;s cause) and gender discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022b936ff49-b7f7-4c16-8bbf-d8b8dd303b12\u0022\u003eImprisonment, the \u0026ldquo;Cat and Mouse\u0026rdquo; Act, and the Bodyguard\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA large number of suffragettes were imprisoned in Britain in the first years of the 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century. They were mostly arrested for public order offences and the refusal to pay fines. Often, suffragettes chose to spend time in jail\u0026nbsp;to gain attention for their cause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile imprisoned, \u003cstrong\u003ethe suffragettes sought to be considered political prisoners\u003c/strong\u003e, as this would have given them privileges such as being allowed to write books or articles\u0026nbsp;and receive frequent visits. The campaign for imprisoned suffragettes to be considered political prisoners was also undertaken outside of prison by the WSPU, but it was largely unsuccessful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a result, \u003cstrong\u003eimprisoned suffragettes staged hunger strikes\u003c/strong\u003e, beginning with Marion Wallace Dunlop, who refused food without consulting suffragette leaders. Because Dunlop was freed out of fear she might die and become a martyr for the suffrage, other suffragettes began to refuse food to be released from prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hunger strikes ceased for two years after Home Secretary Winston Churchill adopted Rule 243A in 1910, which allowed \u003cstrong\u003ecertain privileges for imprisoned suffragettes\u003c/strong\u003e. The hunger strikes began again when the suffragette leader\u0026nbsp;Emmeline Pankhurst received more freedoms than others, which led to other suffragettes to refuse food\u0026nbsp;to protest their own prison status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs suffragette demonstrations became more aggressive, the British Government changed its approach and became unwilling to release suffragettes before they had served their sentences. To\u0026nbsp;avoid being held responsible for the deaths of those who refused food,\u003cstrong\u003e the prison began to force-feed the hunger strikers using tubes\u003c/strong\u003e. The process proved extremely dangerous for suffragettes, as they did not consent to being fed. As a result of the force applied in the\u0026nbsp;process, some suffragettes\u0026rsquo; physical and mental health was affected both in the short and long term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1913, the Prisoners Act, or \u003cstrong\u003ethe \u0026ldquo;Cat and Mouse\u0026rdquo; Act\u003c/strong\u003e was passed. The act made the hunger strikes legal and stated that hunger strikers may be released but had to return to prison to finish their sentences once they were in good health. The Act absolved the British Government from any responsibility for the striker\u0026rsquo;s health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn response to the \u0026ldquo;Cat and Mouse\u0026rdquo; Act, \u003cstrong\u003eWSPU created a secret society known as the Bodyguard\u003c/strong\u003e. The society\u0026rsquo;s members aimed to protect suffragette leaders from arrest and assault by using the Japanese martial art of Jujitsu. One of the most notable events involving the society was the Battle of Glasgow\u0026nbsp;on 9\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e of March, 1914, when 30 \u0026ldquo;Bodyguards\u0026rdquo; fought about 50 policemen on the stage of St. Andrew\u0026rsquo;s Hall in Glasgow, Scotland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-5\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e384f9a0-c88d-433a-aeca-a126eecb28bb\u0022\u003eWomen\u0026rsquo;s suffrage in the UK during and after World War I\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen World War I began, the suffragettes were released from prison on an amnesty, and Pankhurst ended the suffrage activities to focus on the war effort. \u003cstrong\u003eThe NUWSS continued to lobby during the war years\u003c/strong\u003e, while also funding women\u0026rsquo;s hospitals involved in the war. Their lobbying proved successful, as several acts were passed in the following years which contributed to the enfranchisement of women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough \u003cstrong\u003ethe Representation of the People Act 1918\u003c/strong\u003e, over 8 million women in the UK gained the right to vote, as the act enfranchised both men over 21 years of age and women over the age of 30 who met specific\u0026nbsp;property qualifications.
