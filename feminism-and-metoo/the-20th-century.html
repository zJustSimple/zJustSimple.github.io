Although many women already participated in the industrial economy, they still lacked the same legal rights as men in many parts of society, including the workforce. The leader of the National Women&rsquo;s Party, Alice Paul, wanted an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) under which women would be completely equal to men under the law. However, only some protective legislation for women was passed in terms of physical labour and working hours.</p><p><strong>During World War II, women proved their ability to participate in the economy and achieved greater economic independence</strong> by taking men&rsquo;s places in factories and other jobs. Then, with the end of the war, millions of women quit their jobs and saw themselves returning to their old domestic roles of wife and mother.</p><p>Although women had more access to higher education and employment in the 1940s and the 1950s, the new media of television presented an idealised image of women as homemakers, and the marriage and birth rates increased, while the divorce rate dropped. As a result, <strong>traditional roles for women were largely supported by post-war American society</strong>, and many were still opposed to married women holding jobs. This largely isolated women from economics, politics, and lawmaking.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - "Mink" by Marina Warner</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>The story explores feminism&nbsp;in the 1950s by looking at women&rsquo;s frustrations with only being housewives and mothers&nbsp;and at their desire to also find fulfilment in other ways, such as through financial independence and glamour. The story also looks at later generations of women and how the aims and ideals of feminism have moved on.</p></div></div><h2 data-guid="ba77eb93-3832-4da1-b7be-be40d00df4b7" id="heading-2">Civil rights and feminism</h2><p>Books such as Simone de Beauvoir&rsquo;s <em>The Second Sex</em>, published in the US in 1953, and Betty Friedan&rsquo;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, published in 1963, are said to have played a major role in women beginning to challenge traditional gender roles on a larger scale.</p><p>The women's rights movement that began in the 1960s addressed issues such as women&rsquo;s employment, legal and social inequalities, as well as women&rsquo;s sexuality and reproductive rights. It drew attention to issues such as sexual assault and domestic violence&nbsp;and sought changes in divorce law and custody laws. The general aim of feminist activists was <strong>not only political reform&nbsp;but also to challenge the gender-biased structure of power in society and highlight the more subtle ways in which women were oppressed</strong>.</p><p>The women&rsquo;s rights movement used several tactics which proved successful in the civil rights movement. They used non-violent protest, civil disobedience, and symbolic actions to communicate the importance of women&rsquo;s rights and highlight the oppression they suffered.</p><h2 data-guid="9d574417-3c17-4b57-ac32-e6d090dae62b" id="heading-3">Progress for women&rsquo;s civil rights</h2><p>The progress concerning women&rsquo;s civil rights was marked by several important events. In 1960, for example, <strong>the Food and Drug Administration approved birth control pills&nbsp;for women</strong>. This meant that women could build careers more easily, since they could avoid&nbsp;unwanted pregnancies and the need to remain at home caring for small children.</p><p>In 1961, President Kennedy formed<strong> the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women</strong>, which was tasked with researching women&rsquo;s issues in areas such as work and education&nbsp;and advising the President on them.</p><p><strong>The Equal Pay Act</strong>, passed in 1963, and <strong>the Civil Rights Act</strong>, passed in 1964, technically provided women with equal rights, as the first promised equal pay regardless of gender, while the second outlawed discrimination based on gender. However, many women felt that there was little actual change in society after the acts passed.</p><h3>The National Organisation for Women (NOW)</h3><p>In 1966, the National Organisation for Women (NOW) was created by Betty Friedan and other activists, as they felt society needed a civil rights organisation that specifically addressed women&rsquo;s rights issues.</p><p>The NOW soon issued a <strong>&ldquo;Statement of Purpose&rdquo;</strong>, which addressed key feminist issues such as employment, education, political participation, and discrimination against African-American women.</p><p>In the following year, the NOW organised its <strong>first convention</strong>, where members chose to focus on the repeal of abortion laws, obtaining public funding for child care, and on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which remained a major focus in the women&rsquo;s rights movement for years to come.</p><p>In the following years, the NOW organised <strong>marches and boycotts in the states which had not ratified the ERA</strong>. It also lobbied for the extension of the final deadline for ERA&rsquo;s ratification, but the deadline was only extended to 1982 and stalled because it was not ratified by the minimum required 38 states.</p><p>In the 1970s, the NOW also <strong>helped conceive and pass law regarding pregnancy and abortion rights</strong>. The organisation continued its activity on economic and reproductive rights throughout the decades. In 1972, it became illegal to&nbsp;exclude&nbsp;women from educational programs, which resulted in a large number of women enrolling in higher education. In 1973, the&nbsp;Supreme Court ruling Roe vs. Wade made abortion legal in all states. However, another ruling from 1989 affirmed the states&rsquo; right to prohibit public hospitals from performing abortions&nbsp;and to deny public funding for such procedures.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective 1 - "Weekend" by Fay Weldon</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>The main themes of the short story&nbsp;are sexism and gender roles, as the story focuses on the social representations of women in the 1970s. Through sarcasm and irony, the author criticises&nbsp;the expectations that a male-dominated society has of women, which forces women to fit in a limited set of&nbsp;boxes: wife, mother, friend, career woman, mistress, etc.</p></div></div><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective 2 - "The Abortion" by Alice Walker</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>The story sheds light on&nbsp;women&rsquo;s situation in 1970s American society, particularly in connection to their rights to their bodies and how these rights were confined.</p></div></div><h2 data-guid="64fd1a87-c451-4b73-a722-a0569a42872f" id="heading-4">Feminism in the early 1990s &nbsp;</h2><p>Historians have noticed a change in focus in American feminism beginning with the early 1990s. Feminists, especially younger generations, <strong>focused more on racial diversity, individualism, and sexuality</strong>.</p><p>Another notable difference from the previous feminist period is marked by a <strong>different stance on pornography</strong>. The common anti-pornography stance of 1980s&rsquo; feminism&nbsp;described pornography as another way to oppress women and perpetuate violence against them. In contrast, 1990s&rsquo; feminism generally highlighted the importance of women choosing how they express themselves sexually, which might include the production of pornography and engaging in sex work.</p><p>The term <strong>&ldquo;intersectionality&rdquo;</strong>, first introduced in 1989, became more popular, as it was used to describe the different &ldquo;layers&rdquo; of oppression that women were exposed to. Feminists began to focus more on the idea that a person belonging to more than one marginalised group &ndash; a disabled gay woman, for instance &ndash; experiences more intense discrimination as a result of being at the intersection of these groups.</p><p>Intersectionality is important in the context of feminism as it challenged one of the ideas that stood at the base of women&rsquo;s rights movement &ndash; that women have the same life experiences since they belong to the same oppressed gender. By including intersectionality in feminist theory, feminists also moved past the idea that women are socially defined only through their gender.</p><p><strong>Two events are credited with sparking this shift in focus</strong> &ndash; the emergence of a feminist punk subculture in the early 199os in Washington&nbsp;and the publicity created around the televised testimony of Anita Hill, an African-American woman who accused Clarence Thomas, a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States, of sexual harassment.</p><p>During this period, feminism gained more personal value as it focused on women&rsquo;s individual stories. Sharing personal stories became a way for women to affirm that others, and themselves, are not alone in the experience of oppression.</p><p><strong>A new understanding of the issue of gender</strong> also emerged in this period. The male-female binary began to be seen as an artificial social construct used to maintain power in dominant groups.</p><p>Overall, the feminist activity at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century focused on reproductive rights, sex positivity, as well as intersectionality.

Although many women already participated in the industrial economy, they still lacked the same legal rights as men in many parts of society, including the workforce. The leader of the National Women\u0026rsquo;s Party, Alice Paul, wanted an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) under which women would be completely equal to men under the law. However, only some protective legislation for women was passed in terms of physical labour and working hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDuring World War II, women proved their ability to participate in the economy and achieved greater economic independence\u003c/strong\u003e by taking men\u0026rsquo;s places in factories and other jobs. Then, with the end of the war, millions of women quit their jobs and saw themselves returning to their old domestic roles of wife and mother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough women had more access to higher education and employment in the 1940s and the 1950s, the new media of television presented an idealised image of women as homemakers, and the marriage and birth rates increased, while the divorce rate dropped. As a result, \u003cstrong\u003etraditional roles for women were largely supported by post-war American society\u003c/strong\u003e, and many were still opposed to married women holding jobs. This largely isolated women from economics, politics, and lawmaking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - \u0022Mink\u0022 by Marina Warner\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story explores feminism\u0026nbsp;in the 1950s by looking at women\u0026rsquo;s frustrations with only being housewives and mothers\u0026nbsp;and at their desire to also find fulfilment in other ways, such as through financial independence and glamour.

It drew attention to issues such as sexual assault and domestic violence\u0026nbsp;and sought changes in divorce law and custody laws. The general aim of feminist activists was \u003cstrong\u003enot only political reform\u0026nbsp;but also to challenge the gender-biased structure of power in society and highlight the more subtle ways in which women were oppressed\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe women\u0026rsquo;s rights movement used several tactics which proved successful in the civil rights movement.

In 1960, for example, \u003cstrong\u003ethe Food and Drug Administration approved birth control pills\u0026nbsp;for women\u003c/strong\u003e. This meant that women could build careers more easily, since they could avoid\u0026nbsp;unwanted pregnancies and the need to remain at home caring for small children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1961, President Kennedy formed\u003cstrong\u003e the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women\u003c/strong\u003e, which was tasked with researching women\u0026rsquo;s issues in areas such as work and education\u0026nbsp;and advising the President on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Equal Pay Act\u003c/strong\u003e, passed in 1963, and \u003cstrong\u003ethe Civil Rights Act\u003c/strong\u003e, passed in 1964, technically provided women with equal rights, as the first promised equal pay regardless of gender, while the second outlawed discrimination based on gender. However, many women felt that there was little actual change in society after the acts passed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe National Organisation for Women (NOW)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1966, the National Organisation for Women (NOW) was created by Betty Friedan and other activists, as they felt society needed a civil rights organisation that specifically addressed women\u0026rsquo;s rights issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe NOW soon issued a \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;Statement of Purpose\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e, which addressed key feminist issues such as employment, education, political participation, and discrimination against African-American women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the following year, the NOW organised its \u003cstrong\u003efirst convention\u003c/strong\u003e, where members chose to focus on the repeal of abortion laws, obtaining public funding for child care, and on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which remained a major focus in the women\u0026rsquo;s rights movement for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the following years, the NOW organised \u003cstrong\u003emarches and boycotts in the states which had not ratified the ERA\u003c/strong\u003e. It also lobbied for the extension of the final deadline for ERA\u0026rsquo;s ratification, but the deadline was only extended to 1982 and stalled because it was not ratified by the minimum required 38 states.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 1970s, the NOW also \u003cstrong\u003ehelped conceive and pass law regarding pregnancy and abortion rights\u003c/strong\u003e. The organisation continued its activity on economic and reproductive rights throughout the decades. In 1972, it became illegal to\u0026nbsp;exclude\u0026nbsp;women from educational programs, which resulted in a large number of women enrolling in higher education. In 1973, the\u0026nbsp;Supreme Court ruling Roe vs. Wade made abortion legal in all states. However, another ruling from 1989 affirmed the states\u0026rsquo; right to prohibit public hospitals from performing abortions\u0026nbsp;and to deny public funding for such procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective 1 - \u0022Weekend\u0022 by Fay Weldon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main themes of the short story\u0026nbsp;are sexism and gender roles, as the story focuses on the social representations of women in the 1970s. Through sarcasm and irony, the author criticises\u0026nbsp;the expectations that a male-dominated society has of women, which forces women to fit in a limited set of\u0026nbsp;boxes: wife, mother, friend, career woman, mistress, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective 2 - \u0022The Abortion\u0022 by Alice Walker\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story sheds light on\u0026nbsp;women\u0026rsquo;s situation in 1970s American society, particularly in connection to their rights to their bodies and how these rights were confined.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u002264fd1a87-c451-4b73-a722-a0569a42872f\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003eFeminism in the early 1990s \u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHistorians have noticed a change in focus in American feminism beginning with the early 1990s. Feminists, especially younger generations, \u003cstrong\u003efocused more on racial diversity, individualism, and sexuality\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother notable difference from the previous feminist period is marked by a \u003cstrong\u003edifferent stance on pornography\u003c/strong\u003e. The common anti-pornography stance of 1980s\u0026rsquo; feminism\u0026nbsp;described pornography as another way to oppress women and perpetuate violence against them. In contrast, 1990s\u0026rsquo; feminism generally highlighted the importance of women choosing how they express themselves sexually, which might include the production of pornography and engaging in sex work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe term \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;intersectionality\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e, first introduced in 1989, became more popular, as it was used to describe the different \u0026ldquo;layers\u0026rdquo; of oppression that women were exposed to. Feminists began to focus more on the idea that a person belonging to more than one marginalised group \u0026ndash; a disabled gay woman, for instance \u0026ndash; experiences more intense discrimination as a result of being at the intersection of these groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntersectionality is important in the context of feminism as it challenged one of the ideas that stood at the base of women\u0026rsquo;s rights movement \u0026ndash; that women have the same life experiences since they belong to the same oppressed gender. By including intersectionality in feminist theory, feminists also moved past the idea that women are socially defined only through their gender.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo events are credited with sparking this shift in focus\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; the emergence of a feminist punk subculture in the early 199os in Washington\u0026nbsp;and the publicity created around the televised testimony of Anita Hill, an African-American woman who accused Clarence Thomas, a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States, of sexual harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this period, feminism gained more personal value as it focused on women\u0026rsquo;s individual stories. Sharing personal stories became a way for women to affirm that others, and themselves, are not alone in the experience of oppression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA new understanding of the issue of gender\u003c/strong\u003e also emerged in this period. The male-female binary began to be seen as an artificial social construct used to maintain power in dominant groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the feminist activity at the end of the 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century focused on reproductive rights, sex positivity, as well as intersectionality. The aim was not only to challenge and propose laws related to women\u0026rsquo;s rights\u0026nbsp;but also to challenge definitions and perceptions of\u0026nbsp;women\u0026rsquo;s issues\u0026nbsp;and highlight their complexity.\u003c/p\u003e","MetaTitle":"Feminism in the 20th century","MetaDescription":"In 1920, women gained the right to vote in the US.
