A major trend in science fiction literature was the rapidly rising popularity of sci-fi marketed towards young adults. Meanwhile, science fiction movies became more experimental and increasingly started to blend different genres together. Finally, TV shows became an increasingly important medium thanks to the rise of streaming services like Netflix and HBO, which led to a number of new or rebooted science fiction franchises gaining a wide audience. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is interesting to note that the dystopias of 21<sup>st</sup> century science fiction increasingly reflect the problems that humanity faces in this particular age. For example, many stories focus on the negative and potentially alienating impact of being constantly surrounded by digital technology and social media.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="4ec2c287-0f99-4b20-a38e-c27dca61d4f8">Young Adult science fiction</h2><p>The early 21st century saw a strong increase in science fiction literature aimed at a young adult audience, perhaps as a natural consequence of the incredible success of previous children&rsquo;s and young adult fantasy franchises such as <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Twilight</em>.</p><p>These young adult science fiction stories typically focus on<strong> a teenage protagonist who lives in some kind of <a target="" href="https://liceunet.ro/science-fiction/dystopia-and-utopia">dystopian</a> future society</strong> - usually representing some future version of Earth. The protagonist will typically start out by reluctantly following the directions of the evil, tyrannical government, but will usually end up as part of some kind of rebellion against the dystopian system. Often the stories also feature romantic subplots, borrowing elements from the teen romance genre.</p><p>The two most famous examples of this subgenre are probably <em>The Hunger Games</em> (2008-2010) by Suzanne Collins and <em>Divergent</em> (2011-2013) by Veronica Roth (read more about these below). Other examples include <em>The Maze Runner</em> (2009-2016) by James Dashner and <em>Red Rising</em> (2014-2019) by Pierce Brown.</p><p>Many of these novels have been adapted to big-budget movies, once again demonstrating how popular this genre has become.</p><h3><a name="_ldeg7mvxhdu8"></a>The Hunger Games</h3><p>The <em>Hunger Games</em> trilogy takes place in a future nation called Panem, divided into a capital and 12 surrounding districts (Panem is implied to be located somewhere in North America). There are enormous class differences within this dystopian society, as the citizens of the capital enjoy freedom and luxury, while the citizens of the districts have to endure poverty and deprivation. Most strikingly, each district is annually forced to send two of its citizens to compete in the Hunger Games, a terrifying reality television show which features contestants being forced to fight to the death until only a single survivor remains.</p><p>The novels follow the adventures of the teenage protagonist Katniss Everdeen, who becomes a contestant in the Games and later joins a rebellion against the tyrannical government.</p><p>The <em>Hunger Games</em> franchise has been enormously successful and has played a significant part in boosting the popularity of dystopian science fiction among young adults. It may even have had some influence in popularising the &lsquo;battle royale&rsquo; genre of video games, which are based on a premise very similar to the Hunger Games.</p><h3><a name="_ip60fz52qqnk"></a>Divergent</h3><p>The <em>Divergent </em>trilogy takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Chicago where the population is divided into five distinct factions based on their most dominant personality traits. Those who are unable to - or refuse to - join any of these factions become factionless and are forced to live in poverty at the edges of society.</p><p>The protagonist of the story is Tris, a teenage girl from the Abnegation faction. As she is tested for which faction she should belong to, it is revealed that she has a combination of different personality traits, which marks her as &lsquo;divergent&rsquo; and gives her special advantages, but also puts her in danger.</p><p>The story follows Tris&rsquo; initiation into the Dauntless faction (for brave and reckless personality types) while frequently touching upon classic young adult themes such as growing up, group dynamics, and finding one&rsquo;s identity. It also has a romantic subplot, focusing on the relationship between Tris and her fellow Dauntless Tobias (or &lsquo;Four&rsquo;). Much like <em>The Hunger Games</em>, the series eventually becomes focused on a rebellion against the dystopian government that lies behind the future society&rsquo;s strict class divisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="260b7202-28c5-4f5c-be5a-4561b4885d86"><a name="_f31vjasjnbd0"></a>Science fiction movies</h2><p>It is hard to briefly sum up the trends within science fiction movies in the 21st century, as the genre has moved into countless different directions.</p><p>Some movies have shown a greater tendency to mix science fiction with other genres.</p><p>For example, there have been many examples of <strong>sci-fi horror</strong>, such as <em>28 Days Later</em> (2002) in which a genetically engineered virus turns people into zombie-like creatures, or the more recent <em>A Quiet Place</em> (2018) in which terrifying aliens stalk the Earth, locating their human prey exclusively through the sounds they make .</p><p>We have also seen <strong>sci-fi romances</strong> like <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> (2004) in which a device enables heart-broken people to erase all memories of their former lovers, or <em>Her </em>(2013) in which a lonely man falls in love with an AI.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stories about space travel </strong>have also become popular again recently, with titles such as <em>Gravity</em> (2013), <em>Interstellar</em> (2014) and <em>The Martian</em> (2015) becoming huge hits. These movies are also notable for being based on at least a somewhat realistic understanding of science. &nbsp;</p><p>There have also been an increasing number of movies in recent years that cast <strong>human beings as the villains</strong> in first encounters with aliens - a postmodern reversal of the roles from the classic <em>War of the Worlds</em>. Often this reversal is intended to provide some kind of social commentary on the negative sides of humanity - such as our tendency towards racism or warmongering. <em>District 9</em> (2009) and <em>Arrival</em> (2016) are both good examples of this trend (even though <em>Arrival</em> ultimately ends on an optimistic note).</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="4beb7fdd-142c-498a-a07a-2537eefb8581"><a name="_jfdqmlpn77op"></a>Science fiction TV shows</h2><p>With the increasing popularity of streaming services like Netflix and HBO, TV shows have become a very strong genre within popular culture, and a number of popular science fiction shows have emerged or been revitalized.</p><p>Much like with science fiction movies and literature, many of these shows have a strong dystopian focus, pointing to a future where humanity is worse off in various ways. However, <em>Doctor Who</em> is a bit of an exception here, as it is&nbsp;notable for featuring more optimistic storylines, even though it occasionally delves into various dystopian scenarios as well.</p><h3>Doctor Who</h3><p><em>Doctor Who</em> is a British science fiction show which originally premiered in 1963, but the show was rebooted in 2005 and have been running ever since. The main character of the show is the Doctor, an alien being who looks human, and who owns a device that can travel through both time and space. Travelling with one or more companions, the Doctor explores space and time, always ending up facing various problems that need to be fixed.</p><p>One of the main premises of the show is that the Doctor regenerates in a new body upon death &ndash; meaning that a rotating cast of actors have played the Doctor over time. The current Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker &ndash; the first female actor to play the role.</p><h3><a name="_r0gi6h4je6qt"></a>Black Mirror</h3><p><em>Black Mirror</em> is a British science fiction show which premiered in 2011. In contrast to many other shows, individual episodes are generally self-contained, each telling their own (usually dystopian) story about humanity&rsquo;s future. Despite the self-contained episodes, there is a common theme running through the entire series, focused around the negative impact of modern technology such as social media, smartphones, or video games.</p><h3><a name="_xpkwrs2pi4e3"></a>Westworld</h3><p><em>Westworld</em> is an American science fiction show which premiered in 2016. The show takes place in an advanced amusement park known as Westworld, in which customers can live out their dreams in a world populated entirely by androids - human-like robots.

A major trend in science fiction literature was the rapidly rising popularity of sci-fi marketed towards young adults. Meanwhile, science fiction movies became more experimental and increasingly started to blend different genres together. Finally, TV shows became an increasingly important medium thanks to the rise of streaming services like Netflix and HBO, which led to a number of new or rebooted science fiction franchises gaining a wide audience. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is interesting to note that the dystopias of 21\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e century science fiction increasingly reflect the problems that humanity faces in this particular age. For example, many stories focus on the negative and potentially alienating impact of being constantly surrounded by digital technology and social media.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u00224ec2c287-0f99-4b20-a38e-c27dca61d4f8\u0022\u003eYoung Adult science fiction\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe early 21st century saw a strong increase in science fiction literature aimed at a young adult audience, perhaps as a natural consequence of the incredible success of previous children\u0026rsquo;s and young adult fantasy franchises such as \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eTwilight\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese young adult science fiction stories typically focus on\u003cstrong\u003e a teenage protagonist who lives in some kind of \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/science-fiction/dystopia-and-utopia\u0022\u003edystopian\u003c/a\u003e future society\u003c/strong\u003e - usually representing some future version of Earth. The protagonist will typically start out by reluctantly following the directions of the evil, tyrannical government, but will usually end up as part of some kind of rebellion against the dystopian system. Often the stories also feature romantic subplots, borrowing elements from the teen romance genre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two most famous examples of this subgenre are probably \u003cem\u003eThe Hunger Games\u003c/em\u003e (2008-2010) by Suzanne Collins and \u003cem\u003eDivergent\u003c/em\u003e (2011-2013) by Veronica Roth (read more about these below). Other examples include \u003cem\u003eThe Maze Runner\u003c/em\u003e (2009-2016) by James Dashner and \u003cem\u003eRed Rising\u003c/em\u003e (2014-2019) by Pierce Brown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of these novels have been adapted to big-budget movies, once again demonstrating how popular this genre has become.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_ldeg7mvxhdu8\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe Hunger Games\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eHunger Games\u003c/em\u003e trilogy takes place in a future nation called Panem, divided into a capital and 12 surrounding districts (Panem is implied to be located somewhere in North America). There are enormous class differences within this dystopian society, as the citizens of the capital enjoy freedom and luxury, while the citizens of the districts have to endure poverty and deprivation. Most strikingly, each district is annually forced to send two of its citizens to compete in the Hunger Games, a terrifying reality television show which features contestants being forced to fight to the death until only a single survivor remains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe novels follow the adventures of the teenage protagonist Katniss Everdeen, who becomes a contestant in the Games and later joins a rebellion against the tyrannical government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eHunger Games\u003c/em\u003e franchise has been enormously successful and has played a significant part in boosting the popularity of dystopian science fiction among young adults. It may even have had some influence in popularising the \u0026lsquo;battle royale\u0026rsquo; genre of video games, which are based on a premise very similar to the Hunger Games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_ip60fz52qqnk\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eDivergent\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eDivergent \u003c/em\u003etrilogy takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Chicago where the population is divided into five distinct factions based on their most dominant personality traits. Those who are unable to - or refuse to - join any of these factions become factionless and are forced to live in poverty at the edges of society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe protagonist of the story is Tris, a teenage girl from the Abnegation faction. As she is tested for which faction she should belong to, it is revealed that she has a combination of different personality traits, which marks her as \u0026lsquo;divergent\u0026rsquo; and gives her special advantages, but also puts her in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story follows Tris\u0026rsquo; initiation into the Dauntless faction (for brave and reckless personality types) while frequently touching upon classic young adult themes such as growing up, group dynamics, and finding one\u0026rsquo;s identity. It also has a romantic subplot, focusing on the relationship between Tris and her fellow Dauntless Tobias (or \u0026lsquo;Four\u0026rsquo;). Much like \u003cem\u003eThe Hunger Games\u003c/em\u003e, the series eventually becomes focused on a rebellion against the dystopian government that lies behind the future society\u0026rsquo;s strict class divisions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022260b7202-28c5-4f5c-be5a-4561b4885d86\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_f31vjasjnbd0\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eScience fiction movies\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is hard to briefly sum up the trends within science fiction movies in the 21st century, as the genre has moved into countless different directions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome movies have shown a greater tendency to mix science fiction with other genres.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, there have been many examples of \u003cstrong\u003esci-fi horror\u003c/strong\u003e, such as \u003cem\u003e28 Days Later\u003c/em\u003e (2002) in which a genetically engineered virus turns people into zombie-like creatures, or the more recent \u003cem\u003eA Quiet Place\u003c/em\u003e (2018) in which terrifying aliens stalk the Earth, locating their human prey exclusively through the sounds they make .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have also seen \u003cstrong\u003esci-fi romances\u003c/strong\u003e like \u003cem\u003eEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u003c/em\u003e (2004) in which a device enables heart-broken people to erase all memories of their former lovers, or \u003cem\u003eHer \u003c/em\u003e(2013) in which a lonely man falls in love with an AI.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStories about space travel \u003c/strong\u003ehave also become popular again recently, with titles such as \u003cem\u003eGravity\u003c/em\u003e (2013), \u003cem\u003eInterstellar\u003c/em\u003e (2014) and \u003cem\u003eThe Martian\u003c/em\u003e (2015) becoming huge hits. These movies are also notable for being based on at least a somewhat realistic understanding of science. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere have also been an increasing number of movies in recent years that cast \u003cstrong\u003ehuman beings as the villains\u003c/strong\u003e in first encounters with aliens - a postmodern reversal of the roles from the classic \u003cem\u003eWar of the Worlds\u003c/em\u003e. Often this reversal is intended to provide some kind of social commentary on the negative sides of humanity - such as our tendency towards racism or warmongering. \u003cem\u003eDistrict 9\u003c/em\u003e (2009) and \u003cem\u003eArrival\u003c/em\u003e (2016) are both good examples of this trend (even though \u003cem\u003eArrival\u003c/em\u003e ultimately ends on an optimistic note).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u00224beb7fdd-142c-498a-a07a-2537eefb8581\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_jfdqmlpn77op\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eScience fiction TV shows\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the increasing popularity of streaming services like Netflix and HBO, TV shows have become a very strong genre within popular culture, and a number of popular science fiction shows have emerged or been revitalized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch like with science fiction movies and literature, many of these shows have a strong dystopian focus, pointing to a future where humanity is worse off in various ways. However, \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e is a bit of an exception here, as it is\u0026nbsp;notable for featuring more optimistic storylines, even though it occasionally delves into various dystopian scenarios as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e is a British science fiction show which originally premiered in 1963, but the show was rebooted in 2005 and have been running ever since. The main character of the show is the Doctor, an alien being who looks human, and who owns a device that can travel through both time and space. Travelling with one or more companions, the Doctor explores space and time, always ending up facing various problems that need to be fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the main premises of the show is that the Doctor regenerates in a new body upon death \u0026ndash; meaning that a rotating cast of actors have played the Doctor over time.

In contrast to many other shows, individual episodes are generally self-contained, each telling their own (usually dystopian) story about humanity\u0026rsquo;s future. Despite the self-contained episodes, there is a common theme running through the entire series, focused around the negative impact of modern technology such as social media, smartphones, or video games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_xpkwrs2pi4e3\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWestworld\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWestworld\u003c/em\u003e is an American science fiction show which premiered in 2016.
