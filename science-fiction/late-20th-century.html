We will therefore limit our focus to some of the main trends &ndash; a few historical notes on the Space Race, a quick look at some influential authors, a brief study of new or evolving subgenres, and some notes on major franchises in the movie and TV world.</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="48cc6566-9f3d-42bb-b18d-35ef49aadc03">The Space Race and science fiction</h2><p>In the real world, the second half the 20<sup>th</sup> century was dominated by <a target="" href="../the-cold-war.html">the Cold War</a> between the US and the Soviet Union &ndash; a tense, decades-long conflict which featured a massive arms race and various proxy wars, but few direct confrontations between the two superpowers.</p><p>Though most associate the Cold War with the threat of global nuclear annihilation, it also had a much less violent aspect which had great scientific and cultural impact: The Space Race.&nbsp;</p><p>The Space Race was the popular terms for the US and the Soviet Union's competing efforts to explore outer space. The first highlight of the Space Race was the Soviet Union&rsquo;s successful attempt to send a human being into space in 1961, while&nbsp;the climax was the US&rsquo; successful moon landing in 1969.</p><p>Thanks to mass media, these events were followed all across the globe, sparking the imaginations of entire nations. One of the consequences was that the science fiction genre became both more popular and more focused on space travel in particular, as people had now directly witnessed the possibilities in this field.</p><h1><a name="_wxpopjlt0jex"></a>&lsquo;The big three&rsquo;</h1><p>Towards the middle of the 20th century, three writers in particular started to establish their fame, producing a huge number of novels that helped develop the science fiction genre in new directions, and introduced or refined many of the themes we associate with the genre today. Their fame and influence was so great that they became known as &lsquo;the big three&rsquo; within the science fiction community. These writers were Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein.</p><h3><a name="_w1vf6t7p35sj"></a>Isaac Asimov</h3><p>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was a writer and a professor of biochemistry. He was born in Russia, but his family moved to the US when he was just three years old, and he became a US citizen a few years later.</p><p>Asimov&rsquo;s scientific education was a huge inspiration for his literary works; his stories often pay attention to the scientific details of how a future society would work, to make everything appear as realistic as possible. Thematically, his works also tend to be focused around the importance of science and scientific discoveries in human lives.</p><p>Asimov&rsquo;s most famous novels are the <em>Foundation</em> series (1942- <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;The final volume was published after Asimov's death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;">1993</span>), a complex selection of interconnected works which are focused on the rise and fall of a great galactic empire, and the struggle to retain mankind&rsquo;s scientific knowledge in the process. He is also remembered for the so-called <strong>Three Laws of Robotics</strong>, a fictional set of rules programmed into the robots featured in many of his stories, intended to prevent robots from becoming a danger to human beings. These Laws have not only influenced many other science fiction writers, but are also frequently brought up in real-life&nbsp;debates about how to design potentially harmful AI&nbsp;(such as the programs controlling&nbsp;self-driving cars) in an ethically responsible way.</p><div class="toggle-box" ><header class="toggle-box-header"><span class="toggle-box-header-text" >Textual perspective - "True Love" by Isaac Asimov</span><div class="toggle-box-handle"> </div></header><div class="toggle-box-content" ><p>This short story is a first person narrative by an AI servant who is asked to assist his creator in finding true love. However, as the program grows more and more sophisticated, it starts to want the same things as its creator.</p></div></div><h3>Arthur C. Clarke</h3><p>Arthur C. Clarke (1917-2008) was a British science fiction writer and inventor with degrees in mathematics and physics. Like Asimov, he was therefore able to include very detailed and realistic descriptions of the advanced science that many of his stories relied on.</p><p>Much of Clarke&rsquo;s work focuses on interstellar travel and how humanity might respond to the possibility of it. Often it also features contact with advanced alien races. His most famous novel is probably <strong><em>2001: A Space Odyssey </em>(1968)</strong>, which was written alongside Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s extremely popular and groundbreaking movie of the same name (Clarke also co-wrote the screenplay for the movie).</p><p>Clarke is also famous for <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em> (1973), an award-winning story about a group of humans who investigate a mysterious alien spaceship which has suddenly appeared in the Earth&rsquo;s solar system.</p><h3><a name="_9wqf55ah34vo"></a>Robert A. Heinlein</h3><p>Robert A. Heinlein (1907-1988) was an American author with a background in the US Navy. Much like Asimov&rsquo;s and Clarke&rsquo;s novels drew upon their scientific knowledge, some of Heinlein&rsquo;s work was in many ways influenced by his period of military service.</p><p>One of his most famous novels is <em>Stranger in a Strange Land </em>(1961), the story of a human being raised by Martians, who is taken to a future version of Earth as an adult and reacts to its society as an outsider - eventually making its people rebel against an oppressive system.</p><p>Heinlein is also famous for the controversial novel <em>Starship Troopers </em>(1959), perhaps the most famous example of the <strong>military science fiction</strong> subgenre. The novel describes humanity&rsquo;s future as strongly militarised, with all of its efforts focused on an all-out war against an insect-like alien race.</p><p><em>Starship Troopers</em> has since been criticised for glorifying war and advocating a political system that looks similar to fascism, though some have argued that Heinlein was merely trying to show that war is sometimes a regrettable necessity, while stressing the importance of serving one&rsquo;s country. Despite the criticism it has received, <em>Starship Troopers</em> has had enormous influence on later science fiction in various media.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="e0f33b51-8493-4c6a-a65a-1089dbf43ee0"><a name="_pfe388pkv82k"></a>Emergence of subgenres</h2><p>Aside from the &lsquo;big three&rsquo; (see above), many other authors also explored the field of science fiction in the second half of the 20th century, sometimes launching or refining various subgenres.&nbsp;</p><p>The British author Douglas Adams successfully combined science fiction with comedy in the <em>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> series (1979-1992), focusing on an Englishman named Arthur Dent who goes on various intergalactic adventures following the destruction of Earth. Adams&rsquo; books have become cult classics and are frequently referenced in popular culture &ndash; often through allusions to &lsquo;42&rsquo;, a number which carries a special significance in Adams&rsquo; works.</p><p>Another evolving subgenre was feminist science fiction. A notable writer in this area was Margaret Atwood, who became particularly famous for the dystopian novel &ldquo;The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo;, which depicts a dark future in which America has become a totalitarian, patriarchal society and women are forced into subservient roles. The &lsquo;handmaids&rsquo; referenced in the title suffer a particularly harsh fate, as they are kept imprisoned and forced to bear children for the men in power.</p><p>A major development was the emergence of the cyberpunk genre, typically focusing on a dystopian future where people use technology to augment their bodies and minds in various ways. One of the most famous works within this genre is William Gibson&rsquo;s <em>Neuromancer</em> . This novel is notable for featuring the first recorded use of the term &lsquo;cyberspace&rsquo; - a term which has since been adopted for general use.</p><p>Finally, one of the most productive science fiction authors of the second half of the 20th century was Ray Bradbury, who became particularly known for the huge number of science fiction short stories he produced. <a target="" href="late-20th-century/ray-bradbury.html">You can read more about Ray Bradbury here</a>.</p><h2 id="heading-4" data-guid="d1ffd01a-6a59-422f-a37f-d986a2b5f5ff"><a name="_yz7l08f2srw6"></a>Movies and TV shows</h2><p>The second half of the 20th century saw a huge number of influential science fiction movies and TV shows. The most iconic of these were probably the <em>Star Trek</em> TV show and the <em>Star Wars</em> movies, which became two of the most famous franchises in science fiction. Later on, the cinematic world also started to take up the newly emerged <a target="" href="definition.html">cyberpunk</a> genre.</p><h3><a name="_u05mei3tscw7"></a>Star Trek</h3><p>The original <em>Star Trek</em> series premiered in 1966, created by Gene Roddenberry. It follows the crew of a spaceship as they explore various planets, meeting many different adventures along the way. Though the original <em>Star Trek</em> series did not have a huge audience - and was cancelled after three seasons - the show received multiple awards and created a strong fan culture, especially among American university students. The fandom around the show kept growing, and the increasing popularity led to several new shows in the franchise, as well as a handful of movies.</p><p><em>Star Trek</em> remains one of the best-known science fiction TV shows today, and has had enormous influence on other science fiction shows and movies. Its influence also stretched beyond the sci-fi genre, as many has hailed the show as <strong>socially</strong> <strong>progressive</strong>, since it became known for its multiracial cast early on, and later also for placing women and African Americans in positions of leadership within the show&rsquo;s setting. <a target="" href="../the-civil-rights-movement/important-people.html#heading-4">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> was notably a fan of the original show.</p><p><em>Star Trek</em> may be regarded as <strong><a target="" href="dystopia-and-utopia.html">utopian</a> science fiction</strong>, as it generally presents a positive and optimistic view of humanity&rsquo;s future. For example, the United Federation of Planets (a sort of intergalactic version of the United Nations) is depicted as a peacekeeping power that tries to promote diplomacy and goodwill across the universe, and speaks out against violence.</p><h3><a name="_ql6ouikttyfi"></a>Star Wars</h3><p>The first <em>Star Wars</em> movie premiered in 1977. Its original title was simply <em>Star Wars</em>, but it was later retitled as <em>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</em>.</p><p>The movie introduced a compelling and detailed science fiction setting whose central elements are familiar to almost everyone today. Its rebel heroes traverse multiple planets and go through many hardships in their struggle against the evil Empire - led by the iconic villain Darth Vader. The setting notably includes supernatural elements in the form of &lsquo;the Force&rsquo;, a special power that can be manipulated by the heroic Jedi and the villainous Sith.</p><p><em>Star Wars</em> received glowing reviews, won multiple awards, and was an amazing financial success, paving the way for two sequels in 1980 and 1983, which were also phenomenally successful. The original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy has had an enormous influence on the science fiction genre and is perhaps the most iconic example of science fiction within popular culture.</p><p>A trilogy of prequel movies was released around the turn of the millenium, and more recently Disney Studios have acquired the rights to the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise and have started to produce sequels to the original trilogy - sometimes featuring the original actors reprising their roles.</p><p>In addition, a staggering number of novels, comic books, animated series and video games have expanded the franchise in countless ways since the original trilogy was first released, helping to flesh out the setting for dedicated fans. These additional products are often referred to as the &ldquo;Expanded Universe&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Cyberpunk movies</h3><p>The cyberpunk genre quickly became important in the world of movies, perhaps because of the distinct visual style that this genre invited &ndash; often focusing on dystopian modern cityscapes with dominated by dark colours and an oppressive atmosphere.</p><p>Blade Runner (1982) is one of the most famous cyberpunk movies, depicting a world in which humans co-exist with artificial human-like beings known as replicants, and telling a compelling story which questions what it means to be human. The movie is loosely based on Phillip K. Dick&rsquo;s novel <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> (1968).</p><p>Another iconic cyberpunk movie was <em>The Matrix</em> (1999), which takes place in a setting where almost all of humanity is trapped within an elaborate simulated world, while they are simultaneously enslaved by intelligent machines in the real world. The movie became a huge hit thanks to its combination of stylish action sequences, and a story that takes up fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of reality.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="early-20th-century.html" title="Science fiction in the early 20th century" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Science fiction in the early 20th century</span></a><a href="late-20th-century/ray-bradbury.html" title="Ray Bradbury" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Ray Bradbury</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

Their fame and influence was so great that they became known as \u0026lsquo;the big three\u0026rsquo; within the science fiction community. These writers were Isaac Asimov, Arthur C.

He was born in Russia, but his family moved to the US when he was just three years old, and he became a US citizen a few years later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsimov\u0026rsquo;s scientific education was a huge inspiration for his literary works; his stories often pay attention to the scientific details of how a future society would work, to make everything appear as realistic as possible. Thematically, his works also tend to be focused around the importance of science and scientific discoveries in human lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsimov\u0026rsquo;s most famous novels are the \u003cem\u003eFoundation\u003c/em\u003e series (1942- \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The final volume was published after Asimov\u0027s death.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0022\u003e1993\u003c/span\u003e), a complex selection of interconnected works which are focused on the rise and fall of a great galactic empire, and the struggle to retain mankind\u0026rsquo;s scientific knowledge in the process. He is also remembered for the so-called \u003cstrong\u003eThree Laws of Robotics\u003c/strong\u003e, a fictional set of rules programmed into the robots featured in many of his stories, intended to prevent robots from becoming a danger to human beings. These Laws have not only influenced many other science fiction writers, but are also frequently brought up in real-life\u0026nbsp;debates about how to design potentially harmful AI\u0026nbsp;(such as the programs controlling\u0026nbsp;self-driving cars) in an ethically responsible way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box\u0022 \u003e\u003cheader class=\u0022toggle-box-header\u0022\u003e\u003cspan class=\u0022toggle-box-header-text\u0022 \u003eTextual perspective - \u0022True Love\u0022 by Isaac Asimov\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-handle\u0022\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0022toggle-box-content\u0022 \u003e\u003cp\u003eThis short story is a first person narrative by an AI servant who is asked to assist his creator in finding true love.

Clarke\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArthur C. Clarke (1917-2008) was a British science fiction writer and inventor with degrees in mathematics and physics. Like Asimov, he was therefore able to include very detailed and realistic descriptions of the advanced science that many of his stories relied on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch of Clarke\u0026rsquo;s work focuses on interstellar travel and how humanity might respond to the possibility of it. Often it also features contact with advanced alien races.

Much like Asimov\u0026rsquo;s and Clarke\u0026rsquo;s novels drew upon their scientific knowledge, some of Heinlein\u0026rsquo;s work was in many ways influenced by his period of military service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of his most famous novels is \u003cem\u003eStranger in a Strange Land \u003c/em\u003e(1961), the story of a human being raised by Martians, who is taken to a future version of Earth as an adult and reacts to its society as an outsider - eventually making its people rebel against an oppressive system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeinlein is also famous for the controversial novel \u003cem\u003eStarship Troopers \u003c/em\u003e(1959), perhaps the most famous example of the \u003cstrong\u003emilitary science fiction\u003c/strong\u003e subgenre.

Despite the criticism it has received, \u003cem\u003eStarship Troopers\u003c/em\u003e has had enormous influence on later science fiction in various media.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u0022e0f33b51-8493-4c6a-a65a-1089dbf43ee0\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_pfe388pkv82k\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEmergence of subgenres\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from the \u0026lsquo;big three\u0026rsquo; (see above), many other authors also explored the field of science fiction in the second half of the 20th century, sometimes launching or refining various subgenres.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe British author Douglas Adams successfully combined science fiction with comedy in the \u003cem\u003eHitchhiker\u0026rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e series (1979-1992), focusing on an Englishman named Arthur Dent who goes on various intergalactic adventures following the destruction of Earth. Adams\u0026rsquo; books have become cult classics and are frequently referenced in popular culture \u0026ndash; often through allusions to \u0026lsquo;42\u0026rsquo;, a number which carries a special significance in Adams\u0026rsquo; works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother evolving subgenre was feminist science fiction. A notable writer in this area was Margaret Atwood, who became particularly famous for the dystopian novel \u0026ldquo;The Handmaid\u0026rsquo;s Tale\u0026rdquo;, which depicts a dark future in which America has become a totalitarian, patriarchal society and women are forced into subservient roles. The \u0026lsquo;handmaids\u0026rsquo; referenced in the title suffer a particularly harsh fate, as they are kept imprisoned and forced to bear children for the men in power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA major development was the emergence of the cyberpunk genre, typically focusing on a dystopian future where people use technology to augment their bodies and minds in various ways. One of the most famous works within this genre is William Gibson\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eNeuromancer\u003c/em\u003e . This novel is notable for featuring the first recorded use of the term \u0026lsquo;cyberspace\u0026rsquo; - a term which has since been adopted for general use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, one of the most productive science fiction authors of the second half of the 20th century was Ray Bradbury, who became particularly known for the huge number of science fiction short stories he produced. \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/science-fiction/late-20th-century/ray-bradbury\u0022\u003eYou can read more about Ray Bradbury here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022 data-guid=\u0022d1ffd01a-6a59-422f-a37f-d986a2b5f5ff\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_yz7l08f2srw6\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMovies and TV shows\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second half of the 20th century saw a huge number of influential science fiction movies and TV shows.

Though the original \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e series did not have a huge audience - and was cancelled after three seasons - the show received multiple awards and created a strong fan culture, especially among American university students.
