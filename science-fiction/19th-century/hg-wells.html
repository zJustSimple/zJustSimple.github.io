This left him bedridden for a time, and it was at this point that his strong fascination with literature began.</p><p>Wells&rsquo; family eventually began to struggle financially, forcing them to send out their sons as apprentices in various positions. Wells did not thrive in the harsh conditions of these jobs, but eventually he found a position as a teacher. In between teaching, he completed his formal education and at this time also became interested in politics, particularly in how society could be reformed to become more free and equal - <strong>this interest would later inspire some of Wells&rsquo; </strong><a href="../dystopia-and-utopia.html"><strong>utopian</strong> </a><strong>works</strong>.</p><p>Left without a job at the end of his education, Wells started to write short texts for various publications to earn an income, and eventually moved on to produce his first full-length novel in 1895 - <i>The Time Machine</i>. From this point on, Wells made his living as a writer.</p><p>Later in life, Wells also started to become a more active <strong>political commentator</strong>. Wells was a strong believer in international cooperation, and even had a vision of a global world state that would ensure peace and progress for all of humanity. His book were notably banned and burned in Nazi Germany in 1933, following Wells&rsquo; outspoken criticism of the German regime. It was later revealed that Wells had been put in the so-called &lsquo;Black Book&rsquo; of Nazi Germany, a list of British citizens who were to be arrested once Germany had conquered Great Britain.</p><p>Wells&rsquo; family life was complicated. He married his cousin Isabel in 1891, but they separated when Wells fell in love with one of his students, Jane, whom he married in 1895. Wells and Jane had an open relationship, so Wells also had affairs with numerous other women, some of whom he even had children with.</p><p>Wells died of unknown causes in 1946, when he was 79 years old.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading-2" data-guid="00a67811-a870-4b2e-92be-5c43c5afd425">Literary career</h2><p>Wells&rsquo; first works were shorter texts written for various newspapers and magazines. Many of them were published anonymously, and therefore many of them have been lost.</p><p>Wells&rsquo; novels pioneered the modern science fiction genre and introduced many of the themes and concepts that are still popular today. Wells was also very focused on making his science fiction stories seem realistic, by providing detailed justifications of how the various strange inventions he described might work. <strong>His most famous novels were written early in his career</strong>, at the very end of the 19th century.</p><p>His first novel, <i><strong>The Time Machine</strong></i> (1895), is focused on a character known only as the Time Traveller, who has invented a machine that lets him travel through time. Most of the story involves a trip to the distant future of humanity, which reveals a <a href="../dystopia-and-utopia.html">dystopian</a> world in which humans have evolved into two different races: the passive and child-like Eloi and the aggressive and cannibalistic Morlocks. The story is especially notable for coining the term &ldquo;time machine&rdquo;, and has been strongly influential for future time travel stories.</p><p><i><strong>The Island of Doctor Moreau</strong> </i>(1896) is also a dark science fiction tale, in some ways inspired by Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Frankenstein</i>, focusing on a mad scientist whose work involves creating animal-human hybrids. This novel was an early example of biological science-fiction, drawing upon Darwinian ideas of evolution and the relationship between humans and animals.</p><p><i><strong>The War of the Worlds</strong></i> (1898), perhaps Wells&rsquo; most famous novel, gives an account of an alien invasion of England. Armed with superior technology and weapons, the aliens eventually defeat all of Earth&rsquo;s military forces and take complete control, but are finally killed by Earth&rsquo;s diseases because their immune systems have no protections against them. <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was famously adapted into a radio show in 1938, and was allegedly so realistic that many listeners panicked upon hearing it, believing the invasion to be real - <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/10/30/241797346/75-years-ago-war-of-the-worlds-started-a-panic-or-did-it?t=1551857355562&amp;t=1559563221555">though later research has suggested that the panic was not nearly as widespread as the contemporary newspapers might have suggested</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/10/30/241797346/75-years-ago-war-of-the-worlds-started-a-panic-or-did-it?t=1551857355562">.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Though Wells&rsquo; science fiction stories are by far the most famous, he also wrote in other genres. He even wrote a number of non-fiction books and texts, though some of them also reflected his science fiction, since they were predictions or recommendations about things to come.</p><h2 id="heading-3" data-guid="9c123205-a582-40e1-8154-f9b986ce02dc">Legacy</h2><p>Wells had an enormous influence on later science fiction works, with countless books inspired by the themes and plots of his novels. For example, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> has spawned <strong>countless other stories of alien invasions</strong>, and the ways that humanity might respond to such events. <i>The Time Machine</i> popularised the idea of a machine letting the user travel through time and <strong>inspired much literature and media themed around time travel</strong>.</p><p>Wells also directly <strong>predicted </strong>a number of real-life events and scientific discoveries in his works. For example, <i>The World Set Free</i> (1914) describes something very much like a nuclear weapon, decades before such weapons would be invented. Wells also predicted the beginning of the Second World War with impressive accuracy.</p><p>Finally, Wells had enduring <strong>influence in the political sphere</strong>, as his active work in campaigns for global cooperation and peace paved the way for future UN initiatives. Most notably, his political manifesto <i>The Rights of Man</i> from 1940 influenced the UN&rsquo;s <i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i> in 1948.</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../19th-century.html" title="Science fiction in the 19th century" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Science fiction in the 19th century</span></a><a href="../early-20th-century.html" title="Science fiction in the early 20th century" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Science fiction in the early 20th century</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

This left him bedridden for a time, and it was at this point that his strong fascination with literature began.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells\u0026rsquo; family eventually began to struggle financially, forcing them to send out their sons as apprentices in various positions. Wells did not thrive in the harsh conditions of these jobs, but eventually he found a position as a teacher. In between teaching, he completed his formal education and at this time also became interested in politics, particularly in how society could be reformed to become more free and equal - \u003cstrong\u003ethis interest would later inspire some of Wells\u0026rsquo; \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/science-fiction/dystopia-and-utopia\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eutopian\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eworks\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeft without a job at the end of his education, Wells started to write short texts for various publications to earn an income, and eventually moved on to produce his first full-length novel in 1895 - \u003ci\u003eThe Time Machine\u003c/i\u003e. From this point on, Wells made his living as a writer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater in life, Wells also started to become a more active \u003cstrong\u003epolitical commentator\u003c/strong\u003e. Wells was a strong believer in international cooperation, and even had a vision of a global world state that would ensure peace and progress for all of humanity. His book were notably banned and burned in Nazi Germany in 1933, following Wells\u0026rsquo; outspoken criticism of the German regime. It was later revealed that Wells had been put in the so-called \u0026lsquo;Black Book\u0026rsquo; of Nazi Germany, a list of British citizens who were to be arrested once Germany had conquered Great Britain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells\u0026rsquo; family life was complicated. He married his cousin Isabel in 1891, but they separated when Wells fell in love with one of his students, Jane, whom he married in 1895. Wells and Jane had an open relationship, so Wells also had affairs with numerous other women, some of whom he even had children with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells died of unknown causes in 1946, when he was 79 years old.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022 data-guid=\u002200a67811-a870-4b2e-92be-5c43c5afd425\u0022\u003eLiterary career\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells\u0026rsquo; first works were shorter texts written for various newspapers and magazines. Many of them were published anonymously, and therefore many of them have been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells\u0026rsquo; novels pioneered the modern science fiction genre and introduced many of the themes and concepts that are still popular today. Wells was also very focused on making his science fiction stories seem realistic, by providing detailed justifications of how the various strange inventions he described might work. \u003cstrong\u003eHis most famous novels were written early in his career\u003c/strong\u003e, at the very end of the 19th century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis first novel, \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Time Machine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e (1895), is focused on a character known only as the Time Traveller, who has invented a machine that lets him travel through time. Most of the story involves a trip to the distant future of humanity, which reveals a \u003ca href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/science-fiction/dystopia-and-utopia\u0022\u003edystopian\u003c/a\u003e world in which humans have evolved into two different races: the passive and child-like Eloi and the aggressive and cannibalistic Morlocks. The story is especially notable for coining the term \u0026ldquo;time machine\u0026rdquo;, and has been strongly influential for future time travel stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Island of Doctor Moreau\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/i\u003e(1896) is also a dark science fiction tale, in some ways inspired by Mary Shelley\u0026rsquo;s \u003ci\u003eFrankenstein\u003c/i\u003e, focusing on a mad scientist whose work involves creating animal-human hybrids. This novel was an early example of biological science-fiction, drawing upon Darwinian ideas of evolution and the relationship between humans and animals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe War of the Worlds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e (1898), perhaps Wells\u0026rsquo; most famous novel, gives an account of an alien invasion of England. Armed with superior technology and weapons, the aliens eventually defeat all of Earth\u0026rsquo;s military forces and take complete control, but are finally killed by Earth\u0026rsquo;s diseases because their immune systems have no protections against them. \u003ci\u003eThe War of the Worlds\u003c/i\u003e was famously adapted into a radio show in 1938, and was allegedly so realistic that many listeners panicked upon hearing it, believing the invasion to be real - \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/10/30/241797346/75-years-ago-war-of-the-worlds-started-a-panic-or-did-it?t=1551857355562\u0026amp;t=1559563221555\u0022\u003ethough later research has suggested that the panic was not nearly as widespread as the contemporary newspapers might have suggested\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/10/30/241797346/75-years-ago-war-of-the-worlds-started-a-panic-or-did-it?t=1551857355562\u0022\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough Wells\u0026rsquo; science fiction stories are by far the most famous, he also wrote in other genres. He even wrote a number of non-fiction books and texts, though some of them also reflected his science fiction, since they were predictions or recommendations about things to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022 data-guid=\u00229c123205-a582-40e1-8154-f9b986ce02dc\u0022\u003eLegacy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells had an enormous influence on later science fiction works, with countless books inspired by the themes and plots of his novels. For example, \u003ci\u003eThe War of the Worlds\u003c/i\u003e has spawned \u003cstrong\u003ecountless other stories of alien invasions\u003c/strong\u003e, and the ways that humanity might respond to such events. \u003ci\u003eThe Time Machine\u003c/i\u003e popularised the idea of a machine letting the user travel through time and \u003cstrong\u003einspired much literature and media themed around time travel\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWells also directly \u003cstrong\u003epredicted \u003c/strong\u003ea number of real-life events and scientific discoveries in his works. For example, \u003ci\u003eThe World Set Free\u003c/i\u003e (1914) describes something very much like a nuclear weapon, decades before such weapons would be invented.
