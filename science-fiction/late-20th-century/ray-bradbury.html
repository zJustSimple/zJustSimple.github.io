From an early age Bradbury was strongly interested in literature, eagerly listening to short stories as a small child, and seeking out authors such as H.G. Wells, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe in his youth. Inspired by Poe, young Bradbury even started writing his own horror stories.</p><p>After his family moved to Los Angeles, Ray joined the Los Angeles Science Fiction society, in order to discuss one of his favourite genres with like-minded fans. Bradbury also became fascinated with the cinema during his time in LA, often sneaking in to watch previews of new releases.</p><p>Bradbury&rsquo;s literary career began with short stories produced for non-profit <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;An unofficial printed magazine created by fans of something&amp;nbsp;- either an entire genre (e.g. science fiction) or a specific franchise (e.g. Star Trek). Fanzines have historically been&amp;nbsp;especially common within niche genres such as science fiction, fantasy or horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, websites and online message boards&amp;nbsp;have increasingly replaced fanzines as the places&amp;nbsp;where fan communities interact.&lt;/p&gt;">fanzines</span>, but soon expanded from there, to the point where he was able to make a living as a writer from the early age of 24.</p><p>Though Bradbury graduated from high school, he never continued his formal education. He was sceptical of the idea of going to college, claiming that it would have been bad for his writing abilities. Instead, Bradbury by his own account spend countless hours in the library, both reading up on literary classics and producing his own work.</p><p>Bradbury suffered a stroke in 1999, which left him partially paralyzed and meant he sometimes had to use a wheelchair. However, he continued to write up until his death in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-guid="1c935472-4db3-43ef-aa71-e1cb4b2a95be" id="heading-2"><a name="_2ovvwfg5gmbf"></a>Literary career</h2><p>Ray Bradbury was a very productive writer. He wrote 27 novels and more than 600 short stories in his lifetime. His work spanned many different genres, but he is particularly known for his works of science fiction and horror. Interestingly, Bradbury himself argued that his stories should generally be classified as fantasy rather than science fiction, as he felt most of them were too unrealistic to belong to the genre.</p><p>Bradbury&rsquo;s most famous novel is <a target="" href="../../fahrenheit-451.html"><strong><em>Fahrenheit 451</em></strong></a> (1953), which describes a dystopian future in which all books have been banned in an effort to keep people uneducated and easy to control. When illegal books are discovered, the government sends teams of &lsquo;firemen&rsquo; to systematically burn them (the title of the novel is a reference to the temperature the books are burned at). The story follows a fireman named Guy Montag who initially does the government&rsquo;s work, but who eventually learns to appreciate the value of books and joins the rebellion against the system.</p><p><em>Fahrenheit 451</em> is often compared to <a target="" href="../../1984.html">George Orwell&rsquo;s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></a>. Bradbury&rsquo;s novel has a more optimistic conclusion, however, as it is implied that the dystopian society in his world will collapse upon itself, rather than endure forever like Orwell&rsquo;s dystopia.</p><p>Bradbury is also famous for his huge catalogue of short stories, many of which have been published and re-published as part of various anthologies. Bradbury received a large number of literary awards for his work during his lifetime.</p><h2 data-guid="f2bc1723-1acd-455e-89fa-7f27001b9e6a" id="heading-3"><a name="_e0p8ky89zdyo"></a>Legacy</h2><p>Bradbury&rsquo;s work is widely celebrated, and his death in 2012 prompted countless tributes and statements from influential people around the world - including then-President Barack Obama. Many famous writers and artists spoke about the immense influence that Bradbury has had on their own work &ndash; for example, the movie director Steven Spielberg cited him as an important influence in his life. In honour of his contribution to science fiction, some astronomical phenomena have even been named after Bradbury or his works.</p><h2 data-guid="7c2684b8-4506-451c-b286-c5cb9ebf3620" id="heading-4"><a name="_7y0vnf3ebxwp"></a>Short stories</h2><p>Here is an overview of a few of Bradbury's famous short stories.</p><h3>The Pedestrian</h3><p>&ldquo;The Pedestrian&rdquo; is a story about a dystopian future in which almost all of humanity is perpetually stuck inside their homes, watching television. The main character in the story is different, however, as he likes to go for long walks by himself at night. Towards the end of the story he is stopped by a police car&nbsp;and labelled as mentally ill because he does not conform to the norms of this future society.</p><p>&ldquo;The Pedestrian&rdquo; can be read as a forerunner to Bradbury&rsquo;s novel <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, as there are many similarities between the worlds they describe.</p><h3>The Veldt</h3><p>&ldquo;The Veldt&rdquo; is focused on a family who lives in a highly advanced automatic house. The most advanced part of the house is the nursery, which allows the two children to experience incredibly realistic virtual worlds. However, the parents become alarmed when the worlds of the nursery start to become more threatening and violent, and they attempt to restrict their children&rsquo;s access to their technological playground. It does not go well.</p><h3>A Sound of Thunder</h3><p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;Sound of Thunder&rdquo; is the story of a couple of time travellers who travel back in time on a safari to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex. However, they are strictly forbidden from straying from the path and interfering with anything outside of the hunt itself, as even the tiniest unintended change might alter the future dramatically. The story is one of the most famous literary explorations of the so-called <span class="explanation" data-explanation="&lt;p&gt;The butterfly effect refers to the idea that even a tiny change in the initial conditions of a complex system can create a chain reaction that results in drastic changes over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;">&lsquo;butterfly effect&rsquo;</span> (although Bradbury did not invent the concept), and its main ideas have since been copied in many other time travel stories.</p><h3>All Summer in A Day</h3><p>&ldquo;All Summer in A Day&rdquo; takes place within a human colony living on the planet Venus. In this future, Venus&rsquo; climate has been altered to make it habitable, but the population still suffers from nearly constant rainfall. Once every seven years, the sun comes out for an hour, and this event is celebrated by children and adults alike.</p><p>Despite its science fiction setting, this story touches upon themes that are quite down to earth, such as childhood bullying and the struggles of being an outsider</p></div></article></div><div class="webbook-content"><div class="page-navigation"><a href="../late-20th-century.html" title="Science fiction in the late 20th century" class="previous-page"><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform="rotate(180 15 15)"><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Science fiction in the late 20th century</span></a><a href="../21st-century.html" title="Science fiction in the 21st century" class="next-page"><span class="visible-inline-mobile"></span><span class="visible-inline-desktop">Science fiction in the 21st century</span><svg width="2.5em" height="2.5em" viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="svg-icon "><g transform=""><circle cx="15" cy="15" r="15" fill="#0075e3"></circle><rect x="13" y="10" width="2" height="10" transform="translate(-1 29) rotate(-90)" fill="#fff"></rect><polyline points="16.77 19.76 20.26 15.18 16.84 10.69" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></polyline></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>

From an early age Bradbury was strongly interested in literature, eagerly listening to short stories as a small child, and seeking out authors such as H.G. Wells, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe in his youth. Inspired by Poe, young Bradbury even started writing his own horror stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter his family moved to Los Angeles, Ray joined the Los Angeles Science Fiction society, in order to discuss one of his favourite genres with like-minded fans. Bradbury also became fascinated with the cinema during his time in LA, often sneaking in to watch previews of new releases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradbury\u0026rsquo;s literary career began with short stories produced for non-profit \u003cspan class=\u0022explanation\u0022 data-explanation=\u0022\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;An unofficial printed magazine created by fans of something\u0026amp;nbsp;- either an entire genre (e.g. science fiction) or a specific franchise (e.g. Star Trek).

He was sceptical of the idea of going to college, claiming that it would have been bad for his writing abilities. Instead, Bradbury by his own account spend countless hours in the library, both reading up on literary classics and producing his own work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradbury suffered a stroke in 1999, which left him partially paralyzed and meant he sometimes had to use a wheelchair. However, he continued to write up until his death in 2012.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00221c935472-4db3-43ef-aa71-e1cb4b2a95be\u0022 id=\u0022heading-2\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_2ovvwfg5gmbf\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLiterary career\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eRay Bradbury was a very productive writer. He wrote 27 novels and more than 600 short stories in his lifetime. His work spanned many different genres, but he is particularly known for his works of science fiction and horror. Interestingly, Bradbury himself argued that his stories should generally be classified as fantasy rather than science fiction, as he felt most of them were too unrealistic to belong to the genre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradbury\u0026rsquo;s most famous novel is \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/fahrenheit-451\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (1953), which describes a dystopian future in which all books have been banned in an effort to keep people uneducated and easy to control. When illegal books are discovered, the government sends teams of \u0026lsquo;firemen\u0026rsquo; to systematically burn them (the title of the novel is a reference to the temperature the books are burned at). The story follows a fireman named Guy Montag who initially does the government\u0026rsquo;s work, but who eventually learns to appreciate the value of books and joins the rebellion against the system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/em\u003e is often compared to \u003ca target=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022https://liceunet.ro/1984\u0022\u003eGeorge Orwell\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eNineteen Eighty-Four\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Bradbury\u0026rsquo;s novel has a more optimistic conclusion, however, as it is implied that the dystopian society in his world will collapse upon itself, rather than endure forever like Orwell\u0026rsquo;s dystopia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradbury is also famous for his huge catalogue of short stories, many of which have been published and re-published as part of various anthologies. Bradbury received a large number of literary awards for his work during his lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u0022f2bc1723-1acd-455e-89fa-7f27001b9e6a\u0022 id=\u0022heading-3\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_e0p8ky89zdyo\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLegacy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradbury\u0026rsquo;s work is widely celebrated, and his death in 2012 prompted countless tributes and statements from influential people around the world - including then-President Barack Obama. Many famous writers and artists spoke about the immense influence that Bradbury has had on their own work \u0026ndash; for example, the movie director Steven Spielberg cited him as an important influence in his life. In honour of his contribution to science fiction, some astronomical phenomena have even been named after Bradbury or his works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-guid=\u00227c2684b8-4506-451c-b286-c5cb9ebf3620\u0022 id=\u0022heading-4\u0022\u003e\u003ca name=\u0022_7y0vnf3ebxwp\u0022\u003e\u003c/a\u003eShort stories\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is an overview of a few of Bradbury\u0027s famous short stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Pedestrian\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Pedestrian\u0026rdquo; is a story about a dystopian future in which almost all of humanity is perpetually stuck inside their homes, watching television. The main character in the story is different, however, as he likes to go for long walks by himself at night. Towards the end of the story he is stopped by a police car\u0026nbsp;and labelled as mentally ill because he does not conform to the norms of this future society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Pedestrian\u0026rdquo; can be read as a forerunner to Bradbury\u0026rsquo;s novel \u003cem\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/em\u003e, as there are many similarities between the worlds they describe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Veldt\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Veldt\u0026rdquo; is focused on a family who lives in a highly advanced automatic house. The most advanced part of the house is the nursery, which allows the two children to experience incredibly realistic virtual worlds. However, the parents become alarmed when the worlds of the nursery start to become more threatening and violent, and they attempt to restrict their children\u0026rsquo;s access to their technological playground.
